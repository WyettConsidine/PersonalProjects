"Design fabrication and measurement of a novel cooling arm for fusion
  energy source",  The issues of energy and environment are the main constraint of sustainable development in worldwide. Nuclear energy source is one important optional choice for long term sustainable development. The nuclear energy consists of fusion energy and fission energy. Compared with fission inertial confinement fusion (ICF) is a kind of clean fusion energy and can generate large energy and little environmental pollution. ICF mainly consists of peripheral driver unit and target. The cooling arm is an important component of the target which cools the hohlraum to maintain the required temperature and positions the thermal-mechanical package (TMP) assembly. This paper mainly investigates the cooling arm including the structural design the verticality of sidewall and the mechanical properties. The TMP assembly is uniformly clamped in its radial when using (111) crystal orientation silicon to fabricate cooling arm. The finite element method is used to design the structure of cooling arm with 16 clamping arms and the MEMS technologies are employed to fabricate the micro-size cooling arm structure with high vertical sidewall. Finally the mechanical test of cooling arm is taken and the result can meet the requirement of positioning TMP assembly. ,
Energy Realpolitik: Towards a Sustainable Energy Strategy,  A long-term strategy based on existing technological ecological economical and geopolitical realities is urgently needed to develop a sustainable energy economy which should be designed with adaptability to unpredicted changes in any of these aspects. While only a highly diverse energy portfolio and conservation can ultimately guarantee optimum sustainability based on a comparison of current primary energy generation methods it is argued that future energy strategy has to rely heavily on expanded coal and nuclear energy sectors. A comparison of relative potentials merits and risks associated with fossil-fuel renewable and nuclear technologies suggests that the balance of technologies should be shifted in favor of new-generation safe nuclear methods to produce electricity while clean-coal plants should be assigned to transportation fuel. Novel nuclear technologies exploit fission of uranium and thorium as primary energy sources with fast-spectrum and transmutation (burner) reactors. A closed fuel cycle and waste transmutation resolve the strategic issues associated with nuclear power. Innovative reactor designs utilize spallation of heavy metals in subcritical accelerator driven systems or molten-salt reactors. Importation and reconstruction of technical expertise already lost and aversion of further erosion are preconditions to any successful energy strategy. Research opportunities to perfect innovative nuclear coal and renewable energy technologies should be pursued. ,
"A numerical modeling of rotating substellar objects up to mass-shedding
  limits",  Rotation may affect the occurrence of sustainable hydrogen burning in very low-mass stellar objects by the introduction of centrifugal force to the hydrostatic balance as well as by the appearance of rotational break-up of the objects (mass-shedding limit) for rapidly rotating cases. We numerically construct the models of rotating very low-mass stellar objects that may or may not experience sustained nuclear reaction (hydrogen-burning) as their energy source. The rotation is not limited to being slow so the effect of the rotational deformation of them is not infinitesimally small. Critical curves of sustainable hydrogen burning in the parameter space of mass versus central degeneracy on which the nuclear energy generation balances the surface luminosity are obtained for different values of angular momentum. It is shown that if the angular momentum exceeds the threshold $J_0=8.85\times 10^{48}{\rm erg}~{\rm s}$ the critical curve is broken up into two branches with lower and higher degeneracy because of the mass-shedding limit. Based on the results we model mechano-thermal evolutions of substellar objects in which cooling as well as mass/angular momentum reductions are followed for two simplified cases. The case with such external braking mechanisms as magnetized wind or magnetic braking is mainly controlled by the spin-down timescale. The other case with no external braking leads to the mass-shedding limit after gravitational contraction. Thereafter the object sheds its mass to form a ring or a disc surrounding it and shrinks. ,
Study of Minor Actinides Transmutation in PWR MOX fuel,  The management of long-lived radionuclides in spent fuel is a key issue to achieve the closed nuclear fuel cycle and the sustainable development of nuclear energy. Partitioning-Transmutation is supposed to be an efficient method to treat the long-lived radionuclides in spent fuel. Some Minor Actinides (MAs) have very long half-lives among the radionuclides in the spent fuel. Accordingly the study of MAs transmutation is a significant work for the post-processing of spent fuel.   In the present work the transmutations in Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) mixed oxide (MOX) fuel are investigated through the Monte Carlo based code RMC. Two kinds of MAs $^{237}$Np and five MAs ($^{237}$Np $^{241}$Am $^{243}$Am $^{244}$Cm and $^{245}$Cm) are incorporated homogeneously into the MOX fuel assembly. The transmutation of MAs is simulated with different initial MOX concentrations.   The results indicate an overall nice efficiency of transmutation in both initial MOX concentrations especially for the two kinds of MAs primarily generated in the UOX fuel $^{237}$Np and $^{241}$Am. In addition the inclusion of $^{237}$Np in MOX has no large influence for other MAs while the transmutation efficiency of $^{237}$Np is excellent. The transmutation of MAs in MOX fuel depletion is expected to be a new efficient nuclear spent fuel management method for the future nuclear power generation. ,
"Laterally Propagating Detonations in Thin Helium Layers on Accreting
  White Dwarfs",  Theoretical work has shown that intermediate mass (0.01Msun<M_He<0.1Msun) Helium shells will unstably ignite on the accreting white dwarf (WD) in an AM CVn binary. For more massive (M>0.8Msun) WDs these helium shells can be dense enough (5x10^5 g/cc) that the convectively burning region runs away on a timescale comparable to the sound travel time across the shell; raising the possibility for an explosive outcome. The nature of the explosion (i.e. deflagration or detonation) remains ambiguous. In the case of detonation this causes a laterally propagating front whose properties in these geometrically thin and low density shells we begin to study here. Our calculations show that the radial expansion time of <0.1 s leads to incomplete helium burning in agreement with recent work by Sim and collaborators but that the nuclear energy released is still adequate to realize a self-sustaining detonation propagating laterally at slower than the Chapman-Jouguet speed. Our simulations resolve the subsonic region behind the front and are consistent with a direct computation of the reaction structure from the shock strength. The ashes are typically He rich and consist of predominantly Ti-44 Cr-48 along with a small amount of Fe-52 with very little Ni-56 and with significant Ca-40 in carbon-enriched layers. If this helium detonation results in a Type Ia Supernova its spectral signatures would appear for the first few days after explosion. (abridged) ,
Dynamical control of nuclear isomer depletion via electron vortex beams,  Long-lived excited states of atomic nuclei can act as energy traps. These states known as nuclear isomers can store a large amount of energy over long periods of time with a very high energy-to-mass ratio. Under natural conditions the trapped energy is only slowly released limited by the long isomer lifetimes. Dynamical external control of nuclear state population has proven so far very challenging despite ground-breaking incentives for a clean and efficient energy storage solution. Here we describe a protocol to achieve the external control of the isomeric nuclear decay by using electrons whose wavefunction has been especially designed and reshaped on demand. Recombination of these electrons into the atomic shell around the isomer can lead to the controlled release of the stored nuclear energy. On the example of $^{93m}$Mo we show that the use of tailored electron vortex beams increases the depletion by four orders of magnitude compared to the spontaneous nuclear decay of the isomer. Furthermore specific orbitals can sustain an enhancement of the recombination cross section for vortex electron beams by as much as six orders of magnitude providing a handle for manipulating the capture mechanism. These findings open new prospects for controlling the interplay between atomic and nuclear degrees of freedom with potential energy-related and high-energy radiation sources applications. ,
"Core-collapse supernova simulations with reduced nucleosynthesis
  networks",  We present core-collapse supernova simulations including nuclear reaction networks that impact explosion dynamics and nucleosynthesis. The different composition treatment can lead to changes in the neutrino heating in the vicinity of the shock by modifying the number of nucleons and thus the neutrino-opacity of the region. This reduces the ram pressure outside the shock and allows an easier expansion. The energy released by the nuclear reactions during collapse also slows down the accretion and aids the shock expansion. In addition nuclear energy generation in the postshocked matter produces up to $20\%$ more energetic explosions. Nucleosynthesis is affected due to the different dynamic evolution of the explosion. Our results indicate that the energy generation from nuclear reactions helps to sustain late outflows from the vicinity of the proto-neutron star synthesizing more neutron-rich species. Furthermore we show that there are systematic discrepancies between the ejecta calculated with in-situ and ex-situ reaction networks. These differences stem from the intrinsic characteristics of evolving the composition in hydrodynamic simulations or calculating it with Lagrangian tracer particles. The mass fractions of some Ca Ti Cr and Fe isotopes are consistently underproduced in postprocessing calculations leading to different nucleosynthesis paths. Our results suggest that large in-situ nuclear reaction networks are important for a realistic feedback of the energy generation the neutrino heating and a more accurate ejecta composition. ,
"Fast Uncertainty Quantification of Spent Nuclear Fuel with Neural
  Networks",  The accurate calculation and uncertainty quantification of the characteristics of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) play a crucial role in ensuring the safety efficiency and sustainability of nuclear energy production waste management and nuclear safeguards. State of the art physics-based models while reliable are computationally intensive and time-consuming. This paper presents a surrogate modeling approach using neural networks (NN) to predict a number of SNF characteristics with reduced computational costs compared to physics-based models. An NN is trained using data generated from CASMO5 lattice calculations. The trained NN accurately predicts decay heat and nuclide concentrations of SNF as a function of key input parameters such as enrichment burnup cooling time between cycles mean boron concentration and fuel temperature. The model is validated against physics-based decay heat simulations and measurements of different uranium oxide fuel assemblies from two different pressurized water reactors. In addition the NN is used to perform sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification. The results are in very good alignment to CASMO5 while the computational costs (taking into account the costs of generating training samples) are reduced by a factor of 10 or more. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using NNs as surrogate models for fast characterization of SNF providing a promising avenue for improving computational efficiency in assessing nuclear fuel behavior and associated risks. ,
