Applications of Nuclear Physics,http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02756v1,2017-01-10T19:02:08Z,2017-01-10T19:02:08Z,"  Today the applications of nuclear physics span a very broad range of topics and fields. This review discusses a number of aspects of these applications, including selected topics and concepts in nuclear reactor physics, nuclear fusion, nuclear non-proliferation, nuclear-geophysics, and nuclear medicine. The review begins with a historic summary of the early years in applied nuclear physics, with an emphasis on the huge developments that took place around the time of World War II, and that underlie the physics involved in designs of nuclear explosions, controlled nuclear energy, and nuclear fusion. The review then moves to focus on modern applications of these concepts, including the basic concepts and diagnostics developed for the forensics of nuclear explosions, the nuclear diagnostics at the National Ignition Facility, nuclear reactor safeguards, and the detection of nuclear material production and trafficking. The review also summarizes recent developments in nuclear geophysics and nuclear medicine. The nuclear geophysics areas discussed include geo-chronology, nuclear logging for industry, the Oklo reactor, and geo-neutrinos. The section on nuclear medicine summarizes the critical advances in nuclear imaging, including PET and SPECT imaging, targeted radionuclide therapy, and the nuclear physics of medical isotope production. Each subfield discussed requires a review article onto itself, which is not the intention of the current review. Rather, the current review is intended for readers who wish to get a broad understanding of applied nuclear physics. ",

Occupation number-based energy functional for nuclear masses,http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.4305v1,2011-10-19T15:01:01Z,2011-10-19T15:01:01Z,  We develop an energy functional with shell-model occupations as the relevant degrees of freedom and compute nuclear masses across the nuclear chart. The functional is based on Hohenberg-Kohn theory with phenomenologically motivated terms. A global fit of the 17-parameter functional to nuclear masses yields a root-mean-square deviation of \chi = 1.31 MeV. Nuclear radii are computed within a model that employs the resulting occupation numbers. ,
Short-range tensor interaction and high-density nuclear symmetry energy,http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0496v1,2011-07-03T21:36:03Z,2011-07-03T21:36:03Z,  Effects of the short-range tensor interaction on the density-dependence of nuclear symmetry energy are examined by applying an approximate expression for the second-order tensor contribution to the symmetry energy derived earlier by G.E. Brown and R. Machleidt. It is found that the uncertainty in the short-range tensor force leads directly to a divergent high-density behavior of the nuclear symmetry energy. ,

However, many interesting questions remain to be studied especially at supra-saturation densities. In this lecture note, after a brief summary of the currently available constraints on nuclear symmetry energy near the saturation density we first discuss the relationship between the symmetry energy and the isopin and momentum dependence of the single-nucleon potential in isospin-asymmetric nuclear medium. We then discuss several open issues regarding effects of the tensor force induced neutron-proton short-range correlation (SRC) on nuclear symmetry energy. Finally, as an example of the impacts of nuclear symmetry energy on properties of neutron stars and gravitational waves, we illustrate effects of the high-density symmetry energy on the tidal polarizability of neutron stars in coalescing binaries.

At high energies, above a few MeV, the nuclear density of states is well described by a formula that depends on the smooth single particle density of states at the Fermi surface, the nuclear shell correction and the pairing energy. In this paper we present an analysis of the low energy behaviour of the nuclear density of states using the saddle point approximation and extensions to it. Furthermore, we prescribe a simple parabolic form for excitation energy, in the low energy limit, which may facilitate an easy computation of level densities. ",

The density dependence parameters of the interaction are obtained by reproducing the saturation energy per nucleon and the saturation density of spin and isospin symmetric cold infinite nuclear matter. The nuclear matter equation of state thus obtained is then used to calculate the pressure, the energy density, the nuclear incompressibility and the velocity of sound in nuclear medium. The results obtained are in good agreement with experimental data and provide a unified description of radioactivity, scattering and nuclear matter. ",

By means of three kinds of quark energy loss parameterizations given in literature and the nuclear parton distribution extracted only with lepton-nucleus deep inelastic scattering experimental data, measured Drell-Yan production cross sections are analyzed for 800GeV proton incident on a variety of nuclear targets from FNAL E866. It is shown that our results with considering the energy loss effect are much different from these of the FNAL E866 who analysis the experimental data with the nuclear parton distribution functions obtained by using the deep inelastic lA collisions and pA nuclear Drell-Yan data . Considering the existence of energy loss effect in Drell-Yan lepton pairs production,we suggest that the extraction of nuclear parton distribution functions should not include Drell-Yan experimental data.

Nuclear charge and neutron radii and nuclear matter: trend analysis,http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06324v1,2016-01-23T23:05:45Z,2016-01-23T23:05:45Z,"  Radii of charge and neutron distributions are fundamental nuclear properties. They depend on both nuclear interaction parameters related to the equation of state of infinite nuclear matter and on quantal shell effects, which are strongly impacted by the presence of nuclear surface. In this work, by studying the dependence of charge and neutron radii, and neutron skin, on nuclear matter parameters, we assess different mechanisms that drive nuclear sizes. We apply nuclear density functional theory using a family of Skyrme functionals obtained by means of different optimization protocols targeting specific nuclear properties. By performing the Monte-Carlo sampling of reasonable functionals around the optimal parametrization, we study correlations between nuclear matter paramaters and observables characterizing charge and neutron distributions. We demonstrate the existence of the strong converse relation between the nuclear charge radii and the saturation density of symmetric nuclear matter and also between the neutron skins and the slope of the symmetry energy. For functionals optimized to experimental binding energies only, proton and neutron radii are weakly correlated due to canceling trends from different nuclear matter parameters. We show that by requiring that the nuclear functional reproduces the empirical saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter practically fixes the charge (or proton) radii, and vice versa. The neutron skin uncertainty primarily depends on the slope of the symmetry energy. Consequently, imposing a constraint on both $\rho_0$ and $L$ practically determines the nuclear size, modulo small variations due to shell effects. ",
Neutrino nuclear response and photo nuclear reaction,http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.0031v1,2013-11-10T06:14:59Z,2013-11-10T06:14:59Z,"  Photo nuclear reactions are shown to be used for studying neutrino/weak nuclear responses involved in astro-neutrino nuclear interactions and double beta decays. Charged current weak responses for ground and excited states are studied by using photo nuclear reactions through isobaric analog states of those states, while neutral current weak responses for excited states are studied by using photo nuclear reactions through the excited states. The weak interaction strengths are studied by measuring the cross sections of the photo nuclear reactions, and the spin and parity of the state are studied by measuring angular correlations of particles emitted from the photo nuclear reactions. Medium-energy polarized photons obtained from laser photons scattered off GeV electrons are very useful. Nuclear responses studied by photo nuclear reactions are used to evaluate neutrino/weak nuclear responses, i.e. nuclear beta and double beta matrix elements and neutrino nuclear interactions, and to verify theoretical calculations for them.

The quark energy loss can be measured best by the nuclear dependence of the high energy nuclear Drell-Yan process. By means of two typical kinds of quark energy loss parametrization and the different sets of nuclear parton distribution functions, we present a analysis of the E866 experiments on the nuclear dependence of Drell-Yan lepton pair production resulting from the bombardment of Be, Fe and W targets by 800GeV protons at Fermilab. It is found that the quark energy loss in cold nuclei is strongly dependent on the used nuclear parton distribution functions. The further prospects of using relatively low energy proton incident on nuclear targets are presented by combining the quark energy loss rate determined from a fit to the E866 nuclear-dependent ratios versus $x_1$, with the nuclear parton distribution functions given from lA deep inelastic scattering (DIS) data. The experimental study of the relatively low energy nuclear Drell-Yan process can give valuable insight in the enengy loss of fast quark propagating a cold nuclei and help to pin down nuclear parton distributions functions.

Although many developments remain to be done, the possibility to directly use QCD to describe nuclear system is a major challenge that is within reach. In this introduction to the 2009 International Joliot-Curie School (EJC2009), new trends in the strong nuclear interaction are summarized starting from quarks and ending with finite or infinite nuclear systems. At different energy scales, selected new concepts and ideas have been discussed in a rather simple way. Recent advances in the theory of nuclear forces, thanks to chiral perturbation and effective field theories, have led to a new generation of strong nuclear interaction particularly suited to low energy nuclear physics. The interesting aspects of new interactions compared to conventional forces are underlined. Recent achievements in ab initio theories that directly start from the bare nucleon-nucleon interaction and their key role to understand the three-body force are illustrated. Finally, future perspectives for standard nuclear physics theories, namely Shell Model and Energy Density Functional, are discussed. ",

Such a relation allows us to extract information on nuclear matter fourth-order symmetry energy $E_{\rm{sym,4}}(\rho_0)$ at normal nuclear density $\rho_0$ from analyzing nuclear mass data. Based on the recent precise extraction of $a_{\rm{sym,4}}(A)$ via the double difference of the ""experimental"" symmetry energy extracted from nuclear masses, for the first time, we estimate a value of $E_{\rm{sym,4}}(\rho_0) = 20.0\pm4.6$ MeV. Such a value of $E_{\rm{sym,4}}(\rho_0)$ is significantly larger than the predictions from mean-field models and thus suggests the importance of considering the effects of beyond the mean-field approximation in nuclear matter calculations.

Nucleon properties in nuclear matter,http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1948v1,2011-03-10T06:39:55Z,2011-03-10T06:39:55Z,  We present recent studies on the effective mass of the nucleon in infinite and homogeneous nuclear matter and its relation to nuclear matter properties within the framework of the in-medium modified Skyrme model. Medium modifications are achieved by introducing optical potential for pion fields and parametrization of the Skyrme parameter in nuclear medium. The present approach is phenomenologically well justified by pion physics in nuclear matter and describe successfully bulk nuclear matter properties. ,
"Emergence of nuclear saturation within $Δ$--full chiral effective
  field theory",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13203v1,2022-12-26T16:17:49Z,2022-12-26T16:17:49Z,  Nuclear saturation is a key property of low-energy nuclear physics that depends on fine details of the nuclear interaction. Here we develop a unified statistical framework that uses realistic nuclear forces to link the theoretical modeling of finite nuclei and infinite nuclear matter. We construct fast and accurate emulators for nuclear-matter observables and employ an iterative history-matching approach to explore and reduce the enormous parameter domain of $\Delta$-full chiral interactions. We find that model calibration including \nuc{16}{O} observables gives saturation predictions that are more accurate and have a smaller variance than those that only use few-body data. ,

  nuclear equation of state",http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09158v1,2023-05-16T04:17:51Z,2023-05-16T04:17:51Z,"  In this work, Canonical Thermodynamical model for nuclear multifragmentation has been updated with realistic nuclear equation of state. Mass distribution, intermediate mass fragment multiplicity as well as isospin sensitive observables have been investigated with semi-microscopic approach of determining nuclear binding and excitation energies. Production of neutron rich isotopes as well as isoscaling and isobaric yield ratio parameters have been significantly modified due to inclusion of this realistic nuclear equation of state. ",
"Saturation of nuclear matter in the relativistic Brueckner Hatree-Fock
  approach with a leading order covariant chiral nuclear force",http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15672v1,2023-12-25T09:36:05Z,2023-12-25T09:36:05Z,"  Nuclear saturation is a crucial feature in nuclear physics that plays a fundamental role in understanding various nuclear phenomena, ranging from properties of finite nuclei to those of neutron stars. However, a proper description of nuclear saturation is highly nontrivial in modern nonrelativistic~\textit{ab initio}~studies because of the elusive three-body forces. In this letter, we calculate the equation of state for nuclear matter in the relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock framework with the leading order covariant chiral nuclear force. We show that a simultaneous description of the nucleon-nucleon scattering data and the saturation of the symmetric nuclear matter can be achieved. In this regard, the relativistic effects nicely explain the saturation of nuclear matter. As a result, the present study provides a new perspective on one of the most salient features in nuclear physics. ",
Nuclear symmetry energy from the Fermi-energy difference in nuclei,http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3659v1,2013-03-15T01:55:11Z,2013-03-15T01:55:11Z,"  The neutron-proton Fermi-energy difference and the correlation to nucleon separation energies for some magic nuclei are investigated with the Skyrme energy density functionals and nuclear masses, with which the nuclear symmetry energy at sub-saturation densities is constrained from 54 Skyrme parameter sets. The extracted nuclear symmetry energy at sub-saturation density of 0.11 fm$^{-3}$ is 26.2 $\pm$ 1.0 MeV with 1.5 $\sigma$ uncertainty. By further combining the neutron-skin thickness of 208Pb, ten Skyrme forces with slope parameter of 28<L<65 are selected for the description of the symmetry energy around saturation densities. ",
Imaging Shapes of Atomic Nuclei in High-Energy Nuclear Collisions,http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06625v1,2024-01-12T15:17:59Z,2024-01-12T15:17:59Z,"  Atomic nuclei are self-organized, many-body quantum systems bound by strong nuclear forces within femtometer-scale space. These complex systems manifest a diverse set of shapes~, traditionally explored via non-invasive spectroscopic techniques at low energies. Their instantaneous shapes, obscured by long-timescale quantum fluctuations, are considered not directly observable at low energy. We introduce a complementary method, collective flow assisted nuclear shape imaging, to image the nuclear global shape by colliding them at ultrarelativistic speeds and analyzing the collective response of outgoing debris. This technique captures a collision-specific snapshot of the spatial matter distribution in the nuclei, which, through the hydrodynamic expansion, leaves imprints on the particle momentum distribution patterns observed in detectors. We benchmark this method in collisions of ground state Uranium-238 nuclei, known for its elongated, axial-symmetric shape. Our findings, while confirming an overall deformation broadly consistent with prior low-energy experiments, also indicate a small deviation from axial symmetry in the nuclear ground state. This approach marks a new way of imaging nuclei, especially those with uncertain shape characteristics, and refines initial conditions in high-energy nuclear collisions. It tackles the important issue of nuclear structure evolution across various energy scales. ",
Towards Understanding Astrophysical Effects of Nuclear Symmetry Energy,http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13175v1,2019-05-29T17:27:56Z,2019-05-29T17:27:56Z,"  Determining the Equation of State (EOS) of dense neutron-rich nuclear matter is a shared goal of both nuclear physics and astrophysics. Except possible phase transitions, the density dependence of nuclear symmetry \esym is the most uncertain part of the EOS of neutron-rich nucleonic matter especially at supra-saturation densities. Much progresses have been made in recent years in predicting the symmetry energy and understanding why it is still very uncertain using various microscopic nuclear many-body theories and phenomenological models. Simultaneously, significant progresses have also been made in probing the symmetry energy in both terrestrial nuclear laboratories and astrophysical observatories. In light of the GW170817 event as well as ongoing or planned nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations probing the EOS of dense neutron-rich matter, we review recent progresses and identify new challenges to the best knowledge we have on several selected topics critical for understanding astrophysical effects of the nuclear symmetry energy.

  $(e,e'p)$ nuclear transparency",http://arxiv.org/abs/nucl-th/9512007v2,1995-12-06T22:47:38Z,1995-12-06T00:07:18Z,"  Nuclear transparency is calculated for high-energy, semi-inclusive $(e,e'p)$ reactions, by accounting for all orders of Glauber multiple-scattering and by using realistic finite-range $p N$ interaction and (dynamically and statistically) correlated nuclear wave functions. The nuclear correlation effect is reduced due to the $p N$ finite-range effect. The net effect is small, and depends sensitively on details of the nuclear correlations in finite nuclei, which are poorly known at present. ",

This ratio is found to be sensitive to the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy, but is independent of the compressibility of symmetric nuclear matter and the in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross sections. The experimental measurement of this ratio thus provides a novel means for determining the nuclear equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter. ",
