1,"The Precautionary Principle (with Application to the Genetic
  Modification of Organisms)","  We present a non-naive version of the Precautionary (PP) that allows us to avoid paranoia and paralysis by confining precaution to specific domains and problems. PP is intended to deal with uncertainty and risk in cases where the absence of evidence and the incompleteness of scientific knowledge carries profound implications and in the presence of risks of ""black swans"" unforeseen and unforeseable events of extreme consequence. We formalize PP placing it within the statistical and probabilistic structure of ruin problems in which a system is at risk of total failure and in place of risk we use a formal fragility based approach. We make a central distinction between 1) thin and fat tails 2) Local and systemic risks and place PP in the joint Fat Tails and systemic cases. We discuss the implications for GMOs (compared to Nuclear energy) and show that GMOs represent a public risk of global harm (while harm from nuclear energy is comparatively limited and better characterized). PP should be used to prescribe severe limits on GMOs. ",,risk

3,"Nuclear Energy Acceptance in Poland: From Societal Attitudes to
  Effective Policy Strategies -- Network Modeling Approach",  Poland is currently undergoing substantial transformation in its energy sector and gaining public support is pivotal for the success of its energy policies. We conducted a study with 338 Polish participants to investigate societal attitudes towards various energy sources including nuclear energy and renewables. Applying a novel network approach we identified a multitude of factors influencing energy acceptance. Political ideology is the central factor in shaping public acceptance however we also found that environmental attitudes risk perception safety concerns and economic variables play substantial roles. Considering the long-term commitment associated with nuclear energy and its role in Poland's energy transformation our findings provide a foundation for improving energy policy in Poland. Our research underscores the importance of policies that resonate with the diverse values beliefs and preferences of the population. While the risk-risk trade-off and technology-focused strategies are effective to a degree we advocate for a more comprehensive approach. The framing strategy which tailors messages to distinct societal values shows particular promise. ,,risk
4,"Determining feature importance for actionable climate change mitigation
  policies",  Given the importance of public support for policy change and implementation public policymakers and researchers have attempted to understand the factors associated with this support for climate change mitigation policy. In this article we compare the feasibility of using different supervised learning methods for regression using a novel socio-economic data set which measures public support for potential climate change mitigation policies. Following this model selection we utilize gradient boosting regression a well-known technique in the machine learning community but relatively uncommon in public policy and public opinion research and seek to understand what factors among the several examined in previous studies are most central to shaping public support for mitigation policies in climate change studies. The use of this method provides novel insights into the most important factors for public support for climate change mitigation policies. Using national survey data we find that the perceived risks associated with climate change are more decisive for shaping public support for policy options promoting renewable energy and regulating pollutants. However we observe a very different behavior related to public support for increasing the use of nuclear energy where climate change risk perception is no longer the sole decisive feature. Our findings indicate that public support for renewable energy is inherently different from that for nuclear energy reliance with the risk perception of climate change dominant for the former playing a subdued role for the latter. ,,risk
5,"Resilient Design in Nuclear Energy: Critical Lessons from a
  Cross-Disciplinary Review of the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Accident",  Nuclear energy has been gaining momentum recently as one of the solutions to tackle climate change. However significant environmental and health-risk concerns remain associated with potential accidents. Despite significant preventive efforts we must acknowledge that accidents may happen and therefore develop strategies and technologies for mitigating their consequences. In this paper we review the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant accident synthesize the time series and accident progressions across relevant disciplines including in-plant physics and engineering systems operators' actions emergency responses meteorology radionuclide release and transport land contamination and health impacts. In light of the latest observations and simulation studies we identify three key factors that exacerbated the consequences of the accident: (1) the failure of Unit 2 containment venting (2) the insufficient integration of radiation measurements and meteorology data in the evacuation strategy and (3) the limited risk assessment and emergency preparedness. We propose new research and development directions to improve the resilience of nuclear power plants including (1) meteorology-informed proactive venting (2) machine learning-enabled adaptive evacuation zones and (3) comprehensive risk-informed emergency planning while leveraging the experience from responses to other disasters. ,,risk
6,A social license for nuclear technologies,"  Nuclear energy technologies have the potential to help mitigate climate change. However these technologies face many challenges including high costs societal concern and opposition and health safety environmental and proliferation risks. Many companies and academic research groups are pursuing advanced designs both fission and fusion-based to address both costs and these risks. This Chapter complements these efforts by analyzing how nuclear technologies can address societal concerns through the acquisition of a social license a nebulous concept that represents ""society's consent"" and that has been used to facilitate and improve a wide range of publicly and privately funded projects and activities subject to a range of regulatory oversight including large industrial facilities controversial genetic engineering research and environmental management. Suggestions for public engagement and consent-based siting two aspects of a social license have been made before. This chapter modernizes these suggestions by briefly reviewing the social license and engagement literature. The Chapter discusses in the context of how to acquire a social license the role of government regulation the role of project proponents and government actors and the role of four key principles including engendering trust transparency meaningful public engagement and protection of health safety and the environment. Further the Chapter uses the social license concept to explain why some nuclear waste repositories have succeeded while others languish and provides concrete recommendations for the deployment of new nuclear waste repositories and advanced power plants both fission and fusion-based.

7,Energy Realpolitik: Towards a Sustainable Energy Strategy,  A long-term strategy based on existing technological ecological economical and geopolitical realities is urgently needed to develop a sustainable energy economy which should be designed with adaptability to unpredicted changes in any of these aspects. While only a highly diverse energy portfolio and conservation can ultimately guarantee optimum sustainability based on a comparison of current primary energy generation methods it is argued that future energy strategy has to rely heavily on expanded coal and nuclear energy sectors. A comparison of relative potentials merits and risks associated with fossil-fuel renewable and nuclear technologies suggests that the balance of technologies should be shifted in favor of new-generation safe nuclear methods to produce electricity while clean-coal plants should be assigned to transportation fuel. Novel nuclear technologies exploit fission of uranium and thorium as primary energy sources with fast-spectrum and transmutation (burner) reactors. A closed fuel cycle and waste transmutation resolve the strategic issues associated with nuclear power. Innovative reactor designs utilize spallation of heavy metals in subcritical accelerator driven systems or molten-salt reactors. Importation and reconstruction of technical expertise already lost and aversion of further erosion are preconditions to any successful energy strategy. Research opportunities to perfect innovative nuclear coal and renewable energy technologies should be pursued. ,,risk
8,"Fast Uncertainty Quantification of Spent Nuclear Fuel with Neural
  Networks",  The accurate calculation and uncertainty quantification of the characteristics of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) play a crucial role in ensuring the safety efficiency and sustainability of nuclear energy production waste management and nuclear safeguards. State of the art physics-based models while reliable are computationally intensive and time-consuming. This paper presents a surrogate modeling approach using neural networks (NN) to predict a number of SNF characteristics with reduced computational costs compared to physics-based models. An NN is trained using data generated from CASMO5 lattice calculations. The trained NN accurately predicts decay heat and nuclide concentrations of SNF as a function of key input parameters such as enrichment burnup cooling time between cycles mean boron concentration and fuel temperature. The model is validated against physics-based decay heat simulations and measurements of different uranium oxide fuel assemblies from two different pressurized water reactors. In addition the NN is used to perform sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification. The results are in very good alignment to CASMO5 while the computational costs (taking into account the costs of generating training samples) are reduced by a factor of 10 or more. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using NNs as surrogate models for fast characterization of SNF providing a promising avenue for improving computational efficiency in assessing nuclear fuel behavior and associated risks. ,,risk
9,"Non-Intrusive Uncertainty Quantification for U3Si2 and UO2 Fuels with
  SiC/SiC Cladding using BISON for Digital Twin-Enabling Technology",  U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Committee (NRC) and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) initiated a future-focused research project to assess the regulatory viability of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven Digital Twins (DTs) for nuclear applications. Advanced accident tolerant fuel (ATF) is one of the priority focus areas of the DOE/ NRC. DTs have the potential to transform the nuclear energy sector in the coming years by incorporating risk-informed decision-making into the Accelerated Fuel Qualification (AFQ) process for ATF. A DT framework can offer game-changing yet practical and informed solutions to the complex problem of qualifying advanced ATFs. However novel ATF technology suffers from a couple of challenges such as (i) Data unavailability; (ii) Lack of data missing data; and (iii) Model uncertainty. These challenges must be resolved to gain the trust in DT framework development. In addition DT-enabling technologies consist of three major areas: (i) modeling and simulation (M&S) covering uncertainty quantification (UQ) sensitivity analysis (SA) data analytics through ML/AI physics-based models and data-informed modeling (ii) Advanced sensors/instrumentation and (iii) Data management. UQ and SA are important segments of DT-enabling technologies to ensure trustworthiness which need to be implemented to meet the DT requirement. Considering the regulatory standpoint of the modeling and simulation (M&S) aspect of DT UQ and SA are paramount to the success of DT framework in terms of multi-criteria and risk-informed decision-making. In this study the adaptability of polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) based UQ/SA in a non-intrusive method in BISON was investigated to ensure M&S aspects of the AFQ for ATF. This study introduces the ML-based UQ and SA methods while exhibiting actual applications to the finite element-based nuclear fuel performance code. ,,risk

1,"A civil super-Manhattan project in nuclear research for a safer and
  prosperous world","  Humankind is confronted with a ""nuclear stewardship curse"" facing the prospect of needing to manage nuclear products over long time scales in the face of the short-time scales of human polities. I propose a super Manhattan-type effort to rejuvenate the nuclear energy industry to overcome the current dead-end in which it finds itself and by force humankind has trapped itself in. A 1% GDP investment over a decade in the main nuclear countries could boost economic growth with a focus on the real world epitomised by nuclear physics/chemistry/engineering/economics with well defined targets. By investing vigorously to obtain scientific and technological breakthroughs we can create the spring of a world economic rebound based on new ways of exploiting nuclear energy both more safely and more durably.

2,Molten-Salt Depleted-Uranium Reactor,  The supercritical reactor core melting and nuclear fuel leaking accidents have troubled fission reactors for decades and greatly limit their extensive applications. Now these troubles are still open. Here we first show a possible perfect reactor Molten-Salt Depleted-Uranium Reactor which is no above accident trouble. We found this reactor could be realized in practical applications in terms of all of the scientific principle principle of operation technology and engineering. Our results demonstrate how these reactors can possess and realize extraordinary excellent characteristics no prompt critical long-term safe and stable operation with negative feedback closed uranium-plutonium cycle chain within the vessel normal operation only with depleted-uranium and depleted-uranium high burnup in reality to realize with fission nuclear energy sufficiently satisfying humanity long-term energy resource needs as well as thoroughly solve the challenges of nuclear criticality safety uranium resource insufficiency and low-carbon development. They could provide safe cheap abundant and clean energy resource and electric power lasting thousands years for humanity. ,,safe
3,Nanoscale Oxygen Defect Gradients in the Actinide Oxides,  Oxygen defects govern the behavior of a range of materials spanning catalysis quantum computing and nuclear energy. Understanding and controlling these defects is particularly important for the safe use storage and disposal of actinide oxides in the nuclear fuel cycle since their oxidation state influences fuel lifetimes stability and the contamination of groundwater. However poorly understood nanoscale fluctuations in these systems can lead to significant deviations from bulk oxidation behavior. Here we describe the first use of aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy to resolve changes in the local oxygen defect environment in UO$_2$ surfaces. We observe large image contrast and spectral changes that reflect the presence of sizable gradients in interstitial oxygen content at the nanoscale which we quantify through first principles calculations and image simulations. These findings reveal an unprecedented level of excess oxygen incorporated in a complex near-surface spatial distribution offering new insight into defect formation pathways and kinetics during UO$_2$ oxidation. ,,safe

5,"Reinforcement learning for Energies of the future and carbon neutrality:
  a Challenge Design","  Current rapid changes in climate increase the urgency to change energy production and consumption management to reduce carbon and other green-house gas production. In this context the French electricity network management company RTE (R{\'e}seau de Transport d'{\'E}lectricit{\'e}) has recently published the results of an extensive study outlining various scenarios for tomorrow's French power management. We propose a challenge that will test the viability of such a scenario. The goal is to control electricity transportation in power networks while pursuing multiple objectives: balancing production and consumption minimizing energetic losses and keeping people and equipment safe and particularly avoiding catastrophic failures. While the importance of the application provides a goal in itself this challenge also aims to push the state-of-the-art in a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) called Reinforcement Learning (RL) which offers new possibilities to tackle control problems. In particular various aspects of the combination of Deep Learning and RL called Deep Reinforcement Learning remain to be harnessed in this application domain. This challenge belongs to a series started in 2019 under the name ""Learning to run a power network"" (L2RPN). In this new edition we introduce new more realistic scenarios proposed by RTE to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 retiring fossil fuel electricity production increasing proportions of renewable and nuclear energy and introducing batteries. Furthermore we provide a baseline using state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm to stimulate the future participants. ",,safe
6,"The impact of the surface energy coefficient on the deformation
  properties of atomic nuclei as predicted by Skyrme energy density functionals",  In the framework of nuclear energy density functional (EDF) methods many nuclear phenomena are related to the deformation of intrinsic states. Their accurate modeling relies on the correct description of the change of nuclear binding energy with deformation. The two most important contributions to the deformation energy have their origin in shell effects that are correlated to the spectrum of single-particle states and the deformability of nuclear matter that can be characterized by a model-dependent surface energy coefficient a_{surf}.   With the goal of improving the global performance of nuclear EDFs through fine-tuning of their deformation properties the purpose of this study is threefold. First to analyze the impact of systematic variations of a_{surf} on properties of nuclei; second to identify observables that can be safely used to narrow down the range of appropriate values of a_{surf} to be targeted in future parameter fits; third to analyze the interdependence of a_{surf} with other properties of a nuclear EDF.   Results for a large variety of relevant observables of deformed nuclei obtained from self-consistent mean-field calculations with a set of purpose-built SLy5sX parameterizations of the Skyrme EDF are correlated with the value of a_{surf}.   The three main conclusions are that there is an evident preference for a comparatively low value of a_{surf} as expected from the performance of existing parameterizations; that the isospin dependence of the surface energy also needs further finetuning in order to describe trends across the chart of nuclei; and that a satisfying simultaneous description of fission barriers and superdeformed states requires a better description of the single-particle spectra.
