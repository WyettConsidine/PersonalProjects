In an online video from Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation, a cartoon simulation shows a tsunami wiping out one of their future nuclear power stations and cutting off power. What happens next? Not much: The reactor quietly shuts itself down. It cools off just by sitting there, no moving parts or fluids, no operator actions, says the reassuring video. Weve designed a reactor that is inherently safe no matter the events.The Seattle-based Ultra Safe and dozens of other companies like it are at the forefront of a global nuclear energy revival. As the world urgently needs to wean itself off fossil fuels, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and get the planets temperature under control, policymakers, companies and researchers are reexamining nuclear energy as a green alternative that can help bolster the power produced by renewables like wind and solar. Today the industry is emerging from a period of stagnation, with a promise to double or triple its capacity by 2050.That revival is undergirded by two hot technology trends. Companies like Ultra Safe are aiming to build small modular reactors (SMRs) designed to be just a fraction of the size of former plants, to reduce both building costs and the scope of possible disasters. And many are aiming to utilize new technologies designed to make meltdown accidents impossible and to create less long-lived waste.But the surge in interest is not without controversy. As with everything in the nuclear landscape, debate rages about whether society actually needs nuclear to tackle climate change, and whether the new systems are as shiny as they seem  with reasonable arguments for and against every promise and risk. Some say the new technologies could offer a fantastic solution to our energy woes; others say nuclear is beset with so many environmental, social and economic problems that it is best abandoned in favor of other ways to meet the globes energy demands.The next few years will decide what course nuclear power takes in the worlds energy future. This is a moment of truth, says Francesca Giovannini, a nuclear policy expert at the Harvard Kennedy School. Over the next few decades, nuclear power is either going to make it, or that industry is fundamentally done for. ... Its 50/50 how this goes.Nuclear power poses some obvious risks  meltdown accidents, nuclear fuel being diverted to weapons programs, environmental issues posed by mining for uranium, the problems of storing nuclear waste. Against a backdrop of such concerns, alongside shifting economics of energy production, nuclear power production started to level off in the early 2000s and even dipped briefly after the Fukushima power plant accident of 2011. Some nations, most notably Germany, decided to shutter their nuclear programs entirely. But global nuclear power production is now starting to inch upward again.Today, nuclear plants produce about 10 percent of global electricity, making nuclear the second largest source of non-fossil-fuel energy after hydropower. There are about 440 nuclear power plants in operation globally; another 60 or so are now being built, and around 100 are on order or planned.Most Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios for keeping the world below 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming include some kind of increase in nuclear power capacity. In the International Energy Agencys (IEA) pathway to net zero, global nuclear power production doubles over 2022 levels by 2050. A key reason for this is that nuclear is seen as a good way to provide consistent baseload power to prop up more variable renewable sources of energy like wind or solar. Without nuclear, advocates say, we would need to build far more wind and solar power plants to ensure reliable supplies, doubling or tripling costs over power networks that include nuclear.Nuclear has plenty of advantages: It produces no carbon emissions (and, counterintuitively, releases less radioactive uranium and other elements into the environment than burning coal does). It takes up a lot less land than renewables, a not insignificant consideration. If the goal is to decarbonize quickly and with as little social pain as possible, nuclear is essential, says Kai Vetter, a nuclear physicist at the University of California, Berkeley.At the UNs Convention on Climate Change meeting in Dubai in December 2023, more than 20 nations signed a declaration to triple nuclear capacity by 2050. And cash is flowing into this effort. In 2020, the US Department of Energy (DOE) notably gave $160 million for two demonstration plants to get up and running by 2027. And in 2022, the European Union declared that some nuclear projects could call themselves green in the same way as renewables, opening the door to environmental financing mechanisms.But as with almost every issue relating to nuclear power, the arguments in favor of nuclear have their detractors. Public policy expert M.V. Ramana at the University of British Columbia is one of many, for example, who say that baseload power is an outdated concept. A smart, diverse and flexible electric grid, they argue, can assure a reliable power supply by shunting power among sources and storage facilities.Most scenarios for global net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 include a role for nuclear power. Here, projections from the International Energy Agency forecast that the total amount of power from nuclear will need to grow by 2050 to meet needs (left). But because the worlds total energy demand is expected to rise significantly, nuclears share of all power generation may actually fall (right).Then theres the question of safety. The grand total of lives lost from all nuclear power generation to date, while hard to quantify, is certainly far lower than the number of people killed by air pollution related to the burning of fossil fuels; a recent paper by NASA scientists concluded that nuclear power saved roughly 1.8 million lives from 1971 to 2009 thanks to avoided air pollution. By some accounts nuclear power has also proved less deadly than wind power, which has been linked to drownings at offshore wind farm sites and helicopter collisions with turbines.But fatality is arguably a blunt way to measure the impacts of the nuclear industry, which also include the risk of accidents contaminating large tracts of land, plus numerous other effects related to such things as mining and waste storage. Ramana has documented how the burden of these last issues falls disproportionately on Indigenous and disempowered communities, working against the goals of social justice. Nuclear power, he writes, does not fit with any idea of a responsible and cleaner energy system.If we are to pursue nuclear power at the scale called for by the IEA, it will take a herculean effort. The IEAs pathway requires the world to ramp up from building five big nuclear plants per year to 20 per year over the next decade. Big plants typically cost billions of dollars and come with big financial risks. Westinghouse Electric Company, for example, recently filed for bankruptcy in the face of billions of dollars of cost overruns during the construction of four nuclear plants in the United States.One plan for reducing those epic and prohibitive costs is to build small modular reactors, ranging from reactors that can be shipped on a truck and produce a couple of hundred megawatts, to tiny single-megawatt sizes that are more akin to hefty diesel generators. The modules could be pre-built in a factory and shipped to a site for installation. All this should make these reactors less frightening prospects for investors (though the end price per unit of electricity might wind up higher than that from a larger nuclear power plant).A handful of SMRs are already in operation in Russia, China and India. Dozens more are in development. Canada has a national SMR action plan, and as of 2021 there were 10 SMR proposals under review (including one from Ultra Safe).But so far, the promise of enticingly low costs for SMR builds hasnt materialized, says Granger Morgan, a physicist and codirector of the Center for Climate and Energy Decision Making at Carnegie Mellon. Morgan has crunched the numbers for nuclear in the US and was disappointed. I thought SMRs were going to hold much more promise, but we cant make the numbers wash, he says.That message was hammered home in November 2023 when the company NuScale scrapped its high-profile advanced plans to build an underground SMR in Idaho in the face of cost hikes. Would it be nice to have nuclear? Yes absolutely, says Morgan. Will it be affordable? Thats very much an open question.Others argue that small isnt always beautiful. While smaller plants present a smaller risk from smaller potential accidents, this strategy also means more plants overall, which means more facilities to protect against theft and terrorism. You have way more fissile material dispersed; you will have to secure way more infrastructure, says Giovannini. I mean, that becomes a mess.While some are focusing on making nuclear plants smaller, theres a parallel movement to make them safer and more efficient. The next generation of reactor designs  Generation IV, in the industrys lingo  includes a suite of six major reactor families, all very different from todays standard, each with many possible variants under development. Much of the attention (particularly in the US) has been focused on three of these: high-temperature gas-cooled, molten salt and sodium-cooled.The ideas behind these technologies, and even some early-stage power plants, have been around for decades. But the new variants of these old ideas combine novel fuels and designs, promising to be safer, more efficient and environmentally friendly. Theyre doing all kinds of whizz-bang, high-tech stuff, says Morgan, who has no doubt that newer reactors can be made safer than old ones.Most existing reactors are water-cooled uranium systems, which were chosen as the dominant technology largely as a quirk of history. Like all reactor types, they have their pros and cons. They need high pressures to stop their coolant waters from boiling off at typical operating temperatures around 300 degrees Celsius. And they are designed to work with relatively slow-moving neutrons  the subatomic particles that collide with nuclear fuel to initiate nuclear fission. Slow-moving neutrons are more likely to interact with fuel particles, but systems that use them are also limited in the kinds of fuels they can use. Catastrophe can strike if the fission reaction runs amok or the reactor gets too hot and the core melts down, as happened at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima, spewing radiation into the environment.Standard water-cooled reactor designs are vulnerable to catastrophic failures leading to explosions and the meltdown of the reactor core, as happened in 1986 to the Chernobyl reactor shown here. Newer designs may be less vulnerable to this type of unsafe meltdown, advocates say.The latest models of water-cooled reactors (sometimes called Gen III Plus, including many SMRs) use new design tricks to reduce the number of safety systems that require human intervention, aiming to stop accidents in their tracks automatically. Gen IV reactors, though, use entirely different coolant materials, are usually designed to operate at higher, more efficient temperatures, and often use faster-speed neutrons that can convert the most prevalent natural isotopes of uranium into usable fuel, or even feed on nuclear waste.High-temperature gas-cooled reactors, for example, run at temperatures up to 950C, making them 20 to 33 percent more thermally efficient than water-cooled reactors. Since the core materials used in these reactors are typically stable up to 1,600C, which is hotter than lava, theres a large margin of safety. The reactor in Ultra Safes video is an SMR that falls into this category; its small size helps, too, with passive cooling. Ultra Safe also makes their own fuel pellets, encased in a bespoke material that they say retains radioactive materials even in extreme conditions. Theyre hoping to build their first commercial micro-reactor in Canada.In molten salt reactors, both fuel and coolant are already liquid. So meltdowns, in the traditional sense, are impossible. And liquid-sodium-cooled reactors have a built-in safety feature: If they heat up, the liquid sodium expands and allows more neutrons to escape through the gaps between atoms, so the reaction (which is driven by neutrons) naturally winds down. The US Department of Energy has funded the US company TerraPower (which has Bill Gates as a major investor) to build a demonstration plant of its sodium-cooled Natrium reactor in Wyoming by 2030.Waste is one area where the new designs really see some significant improvements, says Giovannini. None of the reactors have entirely solved the problem of nuclear waste, but they do provide some significant solutions in terms of quantity, she says. The spent fuel from traditional light water reactors needs to be buried in special repositories for hundreds of thousands of years, because of the production of long-lived radioactive byproducts. Some Gen IV reactors, on the other hand, can transform spent fuel into more fissile isotopes and use it for further fission reactions. This can improve efficiency and produce waste that need only be stored for hundreds of years.Not everyone, though, thinks all these systems are as shiny as they seem. In 2021, the Union of Concerned Scientists published a report entitled Advanced Isnt Always Better, in which they highlighted issues with safety, sustainability and nuclear proliferation. They concluded that nearly all the Gen IV reactor types fail to provide significant enough improvements over [light water reactors] to justify their considerable risks.The report was criticized by some for being ideologically antinuclear, says Giovannini. But, she says, it was very fair to point out that new tech comes with new worries. Liquid salt, the report pointed out, is corrosive; liquid sodium metal can burst into flame when in contact with water or air. High-temperature gas-cooled reactors, the report concluded, while tolerant of high temperatures, are far from meltdown-proof, as some claim.Many of these Gen IV systems offer another key benefit: Their higher temperatures can provide not just electricity but also useful heat. This could be used in many industrial processes, such as the production of steel, cement and fertilizer, which currently burn a lot of fossil fuels in their furnaces.That heat is pretty much for free, says Vetter, who sees a particular utility for nuclear heat in desalination, getting clean drinking water out of saltwater as is done at the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant in California. Indeed, X-energy, a leading US Gen IV nuclear company funded by the DOE, has partnered with Dow chemical company to build its first high-temperature gas-cooled reactor at a Dow chemical production site by 2030. Morgan, though, thinks that most industries will balk at the set-up costs.Even if Gen IV reactors turn out to be technically superior, though, it may be decades before they can be thoroughly tested, passed by regulators and built at commercial scale. With little time to spare in the fight against climate change, the world might be better off simply ramping up old reactor designs that are already proven, says Esam Hussein, a retired nuclear engineer from the University of Regina, Canada. We have the operating experience, we have the regulatory framework, he says. If the goal is to fight climate change, why dont you go with the devil you know?In response to why we need a devil at all, many are quick to point out that no energy solution is problem-free, including renewables. Giovannini says she agrees with the nuclear industrys criticism that we have jumped on renewables in a very uncritical way. Wind and solar require electronics and battery banks to store their energy; these in turn need elements like lithium and cobalt that can come with environmental and social justice issues from mining. Nothing is 100 percent safe, says Vetter.It is hard for many to swallow data, assurances and statistics about nuclear, given its history and the huge amounts of money at stake. I think the nuclear industry is selling a bunch of bullshit most of the time, says Giovannini, who has been critical of how the industry deals with public concerns. But her own main worry about nuclear is theyre moving too slow. If companies like Ultra Safe, X-Energy, TerraPower and others are going to help fight climate change with Gen IV technologies and fleets of small reactors, she and others say, theyre going to have to ramp up fast.Editors note: This story was updated on March 20, 2024, to change a name: Granger Morgan was referred to as Granger instead of Morgan in one reference.

The revised nuclear waste regulatory system must address the entire fuel cycle and consider the different wastes from conventional and next-generation nuclear reactors.Thank you for your interest in republishing!

Notwithstanding justified concerns about aspiring nuclear powers such as Iran, it is worth remembering that there still are only nine countries with nuclear weapons, far less than the two dozen that John F. Kennedy predicted there would be by the 1970s. When nuclear non-proliferation is prioritized, it works.CAMBRIDGE  Preparations are already underway at the United Nations for the 2026 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which was originally signed in 1968. Many expect a contentious event. Some countries are having second thoughts about the principle of non-proliferation, because they wonder if Russia would have invaded Ukraine in 2022 if the latter had kept the nuclear weapons it inherited from the Soviet Union. Such counterfactuals, in turn, have renewed others fears of nuclear proliferation.These concerns are not new, of course. In my memoir, A Life in the American Century, I revisit an equally contentious period in the 1970s, when I was in charge of US President Jimmy Carters non-proliferation policy. Following the 1973 oil crisis, the conventional wisdom was that the world was running out of oil and needed to turn to nuclear energy. However, it was also widely  and wrongly  believed that the world was running out of uranium and therefore would have to rely instead on reprocessed plutonium (a byproduct of the uranium used in nuclear reactors).According to some forecasts at the time, as many as 46 countries would be reprocessing plutonium by 1990. The problem, of course, was that plutonium is a weapons-usable material. A world awash in the trade of plutonium would be at much greater risk of nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism.Please enter your email address and click on the reset-password button.

The campaign is already appearing in more than 2,200 locations in city building lifts and lobbies in Sydney and Melbourne, and on animated digital billboards in airport lounges at Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne Airport.The campaign by the CEC follows an intense push by the federal Coalition, amplified and often widely supported in mainstream media, to bring a halt to the rollout of large scale renewables, and keep coal fired power stations open until some sort of nuclear option becomes available.The Coalitions chief advisors admit that nuclear, which apart from its extremely high costs, is inflexible and has poor ramping rates, to respond in changes of demand or supply, is effectively not comparable with a grid supplied larger by wind and solar, which needs fast and flexible capacity to support it.In effect, because the grid is morphing from a system built around centralised baseload principles to a more distributed system based around wind, solar and flexibility, the two technologies  nuclear and renewables  are effectively incompatible.I agree with the Clean Energy Council that the Australian opposition plan to build nuclear on decommissioned coal sites is not the best solution  though given 25+ years of failure to make renewables useful, their advocacy for more green energy is absurd.Nuclear might be affordable in the long run, but financing high up-front costs is not something financially stretched energy consumers could easily absorb. Building low cost brown coal plants or refurbishing old plants would be a much better strategy for lowering end user energy prices.Dont get me wrong, Im a fan of nuclear, and there are plenty of remote sites in Australia where nuclear would be the cheaper option. But ignoring our vast remaining reserves of brown coal does not make economic sense.Brown coal does not have value as a saleable commodity, because unlike black coal, brown coal cannot be transported economically. Brown coal has lower energy density than black coal, and when stored for transport has a distressing tendency to spontaneously combust. Brown coals only value comes from digging it up then immediately shovelling it into an adjacent coal power plant.Given the success of the first French nuclear program, which was able to proceed without lawfare by and by, Australia could copy that approach. South Korea seems to have a reasonable approach currently, and should be willing to sell advice.Or the Finns whove just paid the price for getting up to pace. What are the Greenies afraid of dropping the nuke ban if solar and wind plus dispatchability 24/7/365 with FCAS is cheapest? As if we didnt know deniers.Thanks, Eric.  It seems to me the only necessary government role in planning, permitting, constructing, operating, and monitoring nuclear energy plants is to keep frivolous lawsuits from interfering in the process.  Larger energy companies should be willing to fund the project, as long as the critical path to remunerative production is not artificially prolonged.  Sure, consumers would probably pay an enhanced fee in the payback years, but the price would settle down and the steady energy supply would be worth it.I agree nuclear is reliable and affordable, my complaint is in many cases for Australia brown coal would deliver lower prices. Australias manufacturing industry shrivelled since the 1950s because of energy prices, only by removing obstacles to the cheapest possible energy can we begin the road to recovery.Once Melbourne had car plants  for   majors Holden, Ford but also Nissan, Volkswagen Toyota ( when it was small), Renault. They built there own bulk carriers in SA  with some subsidy . The national airline  was supported with a policy of  having  50% of the  passengers on all routes. Many of the big mining companies  route  sales through low tax Singapore  so only leave Australia with the pittance of royalties ( made to look generous by the share volume.If the brown coal deposits are near the point of demand and the losses and costs of transmission dont overcome the savings of coal plants relative to nuclear, then it makes economic sense to exploit the coal reserves as you recommend.So, the greenies recognize that a zero carbon, everlasting energy supply is a threat to their intermittent, and NOT renewable energy scheme is a threat? Damn, I have to give them more credit than I have in the past. Sun is effective less than 12 hours a day, planet wide. It has to be at the proper angle in order to even work. You can only use it while the sun is shining effectively. Wind? It is either there or it is not.It is ENERGY INTENSIVE to make solar arrays and wind farms. They have a short lifetime, after which they cannot be recycled, but must be replaced, not to mention the ongoing maintenance to keep them running, and the death of wildlife as a result of them functioning.Somehow, they think there is no cost to digging the minerals needed to support these schemes, and they forget that their renewable energy is not used to build these monstrosities. It is the very energy source that they seek to replace that is required to build them. Lets see solar energy companies use only solar energy to make their panels and wind farm companies use only wind power to build and install them. If that becomes fact, I will start believing. I am not holding my breath, however.Number one whining that nuclear isnt flexible enough to backup wind and solar is absurd. A proper energy source doesnt require copious backup. Wind and solar does therefore it is not a suitable energy source.There is no need to make this more complicated. It is not complicated at all, we need a constant, reliable source of energy at a reasonable cost, it is as simple as that. Wind and solar arent constant, arent reliable and arent affordable.Australia has vast reserves of black and brown coal, natural gas and uranium ore and has been first second or third in global exports of all the above in recent years yet all the above are in some way restricted or banned from use locally.At present the country is on course for a big energy crunch and whichever party happens to be in power at the time will have to decide to lift whichever of those current restrictions on local use will get them in least trouble electorally.Yes.  The smaller reactors are perfect for Australian baseload  with its   wide apart population centres  like Perth Brisbane  etc and  the  15 mill in the SE  part of the country with an existing gridThe 8 February announcement detailed the intention to deploy four Westinghouse AP300 SMRs at the site, a technology previously selected by Great British Nuclear (GBN) in October. These are expected to be up and running by the 2030s, providing 1.5 GW of power, or enough to power up to two million homes.Tis Saturday so demand is a little lower than week days but all Australian regions have experienced negative wholesale price today.  All regions, apart from Tasmania, experienced economic offloading of WDGs.A coal power plant must run all the time because one cannot fire up a boiler and have it running on a now basis. The same for natural gas power stations unless they are the small on/off systems, jet engine style.The current mentality is that there must be subsidies for these wonderful renewables, one for building and another for running even when they dont produce anything. How much in subsidies the tax payer is paying for this renewable wonder thing is seldom if ever publicly available.My limited opinion is that many people, who are easily persuaded against nuclear, look at nuclear power as some form of stand by generation. Hence it is a very high cost. These same people do not know or if the know, what the subsidies to the renewable this is do not include that in the cost of renewables. Its not the VIBE.Brown coal exists mainly in Victoria. Leigh Creek coal is sub bituminous black coal, incorrectly called brown coal. The Leigh Creel coal also can spontaneously combust, but mainly at the coal field not at the power station storage site.Top up power is the extra that is generated by some fluffy thing such as renewables, (wind and solar), battery, and pumped hydro. It in theory is there to fill in the gap between base load and actual demand at a specific time zone.If the various political parties were actually intelligent, sorry mistake there, there would be a complete removal of all subsidies from all forms of renewable power sources, including domestic solar panels and the extensive transmission line needed. Also, no subsidies for domestic feed in traffic or home solar batteries.I have forgotten much of the geology and coal composition as I was working at Leigh Creek a long time ago. The main thing I do remember is both coals were moist and this was partly for the reason of the combustion.Simply they are not high quality thermal coals. Furnace burners must be designed specifically for these colas to get the correct heat and also fuel mix. Fuel mix is an issue, as in the Port Augusta Power station as there needed to be a fine line between coal and over burden to balance the burner flame.So the obvious conclusion here is that the warmunists really dont give a you-know-what about CO2  they just want to remake the modern world to their preferences by centralizing government control over our lives.A recent fact check by the ABC claimed there were 4 countries that were 100% renewable. The industrial powerhouses known as Albania, Nepal, Bhutan and Paraguay (I think) are as near as dammit 100% renewable because they are entirely reliant on hydro, which is perhaps a little irrelevant for most of Australia.I see AGL is moaning that nuclear is a distraction, and nukes cant be sited at coal generating stations because the sites will be repurposed for something else. They cant bear to have the subsidised cash-cow, high priced intermittent renewables, replaced.Modern SMRs are much cheaper than old large nuclear reactors.  One company has an estimated price of USD1.4 bn for two 500MW units Some of the designs which have received Governmental design approval in the USA and Canada have the ability to wrap up and down at a rate of 3% to 5% per minute from 25% capacity.
The UK government revealed plans on Monday to boost Britains nuclear sector, for energy and defense, including massive investments in the future workforce and in its submarine program, which London views as its vital at-sea deterrent.UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has announced a package of public and private investment which is expected to cover the needs of Britains growing nuclear energy industry and to create 40,000 new jobs by 2030.The British government plans to partner with defense companies BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce and Babcock, as well as with French energy giant EDF, to invest more than 763 million ($961 million) by the end of the decade in the relevant skills, jobs and education, it said in a statement.Last year, the UK unveiled a plan to build eight new reactors and new-type small modular reactors by 2050, in an effort to produce 24 gigawatts of electricity, enough to provide a quarter of the countrys needs.The government also announced a commitment to invest up to 300 million ($379 million) in the production of the HALEU fuel required for new high-tech reactors, which is currently only commercially produced in Russia.Meeting the UKs ambitious nuclear targets will require a huge ramp up in all parts of the workforce, from engineering to construction, Tom Greatrex, Chief Executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said, commenting on the new investment plan.The major development initiative comes as the UK authorities work to ensure there will also be enough nuclear-energy-focused workers for the construction and maintenance of its fleet of submarines, which the UK considers vital for its national security, as they are the core of its continuous at-sea nuclear deterrent.Britain is set to expand its submarine industry, boosting its fleet under the AUKUS security pact. AUKUS (Australia, UK and US) was established in 2021. Under the pacts Pillar 1, the US and UK pledged to help Australia acquire nuclear-powered submarines, while Pillar 2 is a broader technology-sharing agreement.On Monday, the British Ministry of Defence published the Defence Nuclear Enterprise Command Paper, in which it underscores the need to sustain Britains nuclear deterrent in a period of heightened risk and volatility that is likely to last beyond the 2030s.
He warned that failure to do so would be a major setback for energy transition. In a pointed criticism, Grossi told the FT that the refusal of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to fund new reactors puts them out of step with the wishes of their shareholders.(Image: Microsoft Bing AI via DALL-E 3)Grossi added that there has been a sea-change in attitudes towards nuclear energy and climate change. He said Russias invasion of Ukraine has pushed energy security to the top of priorities for policy makers globally. At the COP28 global climate meeting in the UAE last December the heads of 22 countriescalled for a triple scale expansionof nuclear energy by 2050.Grossi isnt alone in his advocacy for change at by development banks. The FT reported thatWilliam Magwood, the head of the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency, said he is also adding his voice to Grossis lobbying effort.Magwood told the FT that hes aware of efforts to create a separate nuclear development bank to fund new reactors. However, he also said he thinks that creating new nuclear development program offices in existing banks is a more likely outcome.Not everyone with ideas about global funding of nuclear energy thinks the multi-lateral banks are up to the task. In a post on Linked in,Daniel Dean, Chairman ofInternational Bank for Nuclear Infrastructure(IBNI), wrote;It may be difficult for European Investment Bank and other multilaterals to be effective in supporting nuclear given shareholder/governance issues, capitalization, expertise, standards, competition, etc. that are all unique to nuclear finance.Some of Deans views may be related to the policies of the Asian Development Bank. The FT reported that it does not finance nuclear energy projects due to low public acceptance, risks of nuclear proliferation, safety issues, and high investment costs.In the US the FT reported thatRep. Patrick McHenry(R-NC), who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, told the FT that US funding of nuclear energy is critical to meet the competitive threat of exports of reactors from Russia and China especially to developing nations.In February, McHenry and the Chairman of the Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion Subcommittee, French Hill (R-AR),reintroducedtheInternational Nuclear Energy Financing Act. This legislation, first introduced in 2021, would bring back financing for nuclear power at the World Bank and other international financial institutions. (Bill Text PDF file) (Committee backgrounder white paper)The International Nuclear Energy Financing Act would require the United States Executive Director at the World Bank to advocate and vote for financial assistance for nuclear energy. The bill would also permit U.S. representatives at other international financial institutions  including regional development banks for Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America  to push for nuclear projects. Taken together, the multilateral development banks can commit over $100 billion in annual financing.On the Senate side, in January 2023 U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV), Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources (ENR) Committee, and Jim Risch (R-ID), Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, reintroduced theInternational Nuclear Energy Act of 2023(INEA)S.826.Initially introduced in the 117thCongress, the bipartisan legislation promotes engagement with ally and partner nations to develop a civil nuclear export strategy and offset China and Russias growing influence on international nuclear energy development.(NucNet) In an interview a spokesman for theEuropean Investment Banktold the wire service that nuclear energy projects  potentially including research and development of small modular reactors (SMRs)  can be eligible for financing because they can be bankable under strict economic assessment criteriaIts true that we havent financed greenfield nuclear power generation in more than three decades. There are various reasons for that: any project that we finance must be bankable, meaning that we apply strict economic assessment criteria, the EIB spokesperson said.Each project is assessed on its own merits, depending on economic and financial viability, environmental viability, and technical viability. Europe needs to be present in those technologies, which can be relevant in meeting the Paris climate goals.According toGeorge Borovas, head of the global nuclear practice of international law firm Hunton Andrews Kurth, solving the significant differences between EU members states relating to new nuclear development would be the biggest challenge to any EIB vision to support SMR projects in Europe.Just like all major infrastructure projects, nuclear power presents many benefits that are long-term and sovereign in nature. These benefits are not necessarily captured in the economics of one project and may require sovereign support in the form of direct funding.Borovas said the support of organizations like the EIB, the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the proposed International Bank for Nuclear Infrastructure and export credit agencies, would signal that an individual project has been properly de-risked allowing for commercial investors to consider investment.Addressing climate change, energy security and sustainable development requires nuclear power. For the EU and its member states, now is the time to show their support in any form that is necessary to make these projects a reality, quickly.Last month, Czech finance ministerZbynek Stanjurasaid the country could look to EIB funding for new nuclear construction. Stanjura said changes in the energy mix, including an increased role for nuclear power were one of the strategic areas that would now not be covered by state funds.Earlier this week, a 12-nation European Nuclear Alliance* said momentum in the EU in favor of nuclear energy must now be converted into a comprehensive framework for nuclear development, exploring essential policies including financing. The alliance called for the formation of a working group on financing for new nuclear. The group would explore financing instruments such as support from the EIB or the EUs Innovation Fund to support the deployment of large-scale reactors and SMR technologies.Yves Desbazeille, director-general of Brussels-based industry group nucleareurope, told NucNet the demand for decarbonized electricity is expected to grow significantly over the next decades and the EU needs to ensure that it is providing adequate financing for the development of European net-zero sources of energy,The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC ) has directed the staff to publish aproposedrule anddraftguidance to establish a licensing process for commercial nuclear power plants that is risk- informed, performance-based, and technology-inclusive.The NRC is proposing a rule that will transform the way the agency reviews new reactor applications, while continuing to fulfill our mission to assure the safety of the public, saidNRC Chair Christopher Hanson.This proposed rule leverages significantly more risk insights than our existing regulatory framework in making safety determinations. Applicants can use our existing regulations today, but this proposed rule will provide future nuclear developers a clear, additional pathway for licensing.The proposed rule, to be published in the Federal Register in about six months, will create a new Part 53 section under the NRCs regulations (10 Code of Federal Regulations) as an alternative to the existing, large light water reactor licensing approaches under Parts 50 and 52.The rule, in meeting the requirements of theNuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act, will give plant designers and plant operators flexibility in determining how their nuclear power plant will meet safety criteria. The law was passed by Congress in 2019.The legislation directs the NRC to develop a licensing process for advanced nuclear reactors within two years and to complete a technology-inclusive licensing framework for optional use by advanced reactor designers by 2027. This move is vital sincedozens of companies and research institutionsare developing advanced reactor designs, including molten salt reactors, liquid-metal-cooled reactors and high-temperature gas reactors.The rule sets out criteria in areas including reactor siting requirements; analyzing potential accidents; defining safety functions; categorizing structures, systems, and components; addressing construction and manufacturing requirements; providing defense in depth; and protecting the public and plant workers during normal operations.NucNetreportedthat in astaff requirements memorandum(SRM) (ML24064A039) made public on March 4th, the Commission directed staff to incorporate several changes to a March 2023 draft proposal within six months of the SRMs issuance. The Commission also sent the staff back to the drawing board on several issues saying more work is needed on them.In adetailed assessmentof the commissions action published March 4th, analysts at the Breakthrough Institute, which wrote acritical reviewof the earlier NRC draft of Part 53, wrote, There is still a lot of work to do to form the NRC staffs draft and the Commissions direction into a viable rule. While the SRM provides a lot of information on the Commissions decision, it will take some time to complete an in-depth review of the 1,300+ pages in theSRM package.Part 53 is meant to offer a voluntary alternative to advanced nuclear applicants under a framework that would be technology-inclusive, meaning it is applicable to all reactor technologies. The framework would also be risk-informed, which means using information from risk assessments to focus safety analyses on important issues, and performance-based to ensure plants are regulated based on how they perform and not just how they are designed.The staffs effort to craft the proposed rule began in 2020. The staff conducted extensive public engagement with 21 rounds of public review and comment on preliminary rule language. The staff held 24 public meetings with stakeholders as well as 16 public meetings with NRCs independent advisory group, the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards. The staff will seek feedback from the public when it issues the proposed rule and draft guidance later this year.(DataCenterDynamics) Amazon Web Services (AWS)has acquiredTalen Energys data center campus which is located adjacent to a nuclear power station in Pennsylvania. As part of the March 4th deal, Talen will supply AWS with electric power via a 10-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) from the Susquehanna reactor site.Talen announced it has sold its 960MW Cumulus data center campus for $650 million to a major cloud service provider which Talen identified as Amazon. S&P Global Market Intelligencereportedadditional financial details of the acquisition.The company broke ground for the data center in 2021 and completed the first 48MW, 300,000 square foothyperscale facilityearly last year. The 1,200-acre data center campus gets its power from theSusquehanna Steam Electric Station(SSES).Hyperscale data centers are massive business-critical facilities designed to efficiently support robust, scalable applications and are often associated with big data-producing companies such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, IBM, and Microsoft among others.What further distinguishes hyperscale data centers is the volume of data, compute, and storage services they process. In asurvey, 93% of hyperscale companies expect to have 40 GigaBytes per second (Gbps) or faster network connections. In the same survey, 51% of respondents report that the bandwidth needed to manage vast volumes of data is an increasing challenge.Talen said AWS aims to develop a 960MW data center campus. The cloud company has minimum contractual power commitments that ramp up in 120MW increments over several years. The cloud provider also has two 10-year extension options, tied to nuclear license renewalsCommissioned in 1983 for energy company PPL, the 2,494MW Susquehanna Steam Electric Station is one of the largest nuclear power plants in the US. Its current owner,Talen Energy, was founded in 2015 after the competitive power generation business of PPL Corporation was spun off and combined with competitive generation businesses owned by private equity firmRiverstone Holdings.Riverstone Holdings LLC is an asset management firm that invests in the private markets primarily within energy, power and infrastructure. Since inception, it has raised over $40 billion of capital to invest.Talen Energy formed Cumulus Growth in 2020 to invest in opportunities created by the convergence of digital infrastructure and power and had two separate businesses; Cumulus Data, focused on hyperscale data centers; and Cumulus Coin, focused on digital currency mining. The crypto facility, also located at the Pennsylvania site, is not involved in the sale to Amazon.(WNN) On March 4th Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi witnessed the start of fuel loading at the 500 MWe PrototypeFast Breeder Reactor at Kalpakkamin Tamil Nadu. Fast breeder reactors form the second stage of Indias three-stage nuclear program. (Detailed Technical Image in Research Gate)The Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) has been developed by BHAVINI (Bharatiya Nabhikiya Vidyut Nigam Limited), a government enterprise under the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) which was set up in 2003 to focus on fast breeder reactors. Construction of the PFBR began in 2004, with an original expected completion date of 2010.India has adopted a three-stage nuclear power program, with the long-term goal of deploying a thorium-based closed nuclear fuel cycle. The first stage involves the use of pressurized heavy water reactors (PHWRs), fuelled by natural uranium, and light water reactors. The second stage involves reprocessing used fuel from the first stage to recover the plutonium to fuel FBRs. In stage 3, Advanced Heavy Water Reactors (AHWRs) will burn thorium-plutonium fuels and breed fissile uranium-233.The PFBR will initially use a core of uranium-plutonium mixed oxide (MOX) fuel, surrounded by a uranium-238 blanket, with plans to use a blanket of uranium and thorium to breed plutonium and U-233 for use as driver fuels for AHWRs.The DAE describes the PFBR as an advanced third generation reactor with inherent passive safety features which, since it recycles material recovered from used fuel from the first stage of the program, offers great advantage in terms of significant reduction in nuclear waste generated, thereby avoiding the need for large geological disposal facilities.In January, Modi formally dedicated the Demonstration Fast Reactor Fuel Reprocessing Plant at the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (ICGAR) in Kalpakkam, a precursor to large-scale plants for the reprocessing of fast reactor fuel, and in February, he visited the Kakrapar plant in Gujarat for the dedication of the first two Indian-designed and built 700 MWe PHWRs. The second of those units  Kakrapar 4  was connected to the grid just days later.The UK Government hasannouncedthat Great British Nuclear (GBN) will buy the Wylfa and Oldbury sites for new nuclear projects in a 160m deal with current owners Hitachi. The announcements, made in the Chancellors budget, also includes the launch of the next phase of GBNs Small Modular Reactor technology selection process.The Horizon Project was to develop two UK 1350 MW Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (ABWRs) at Wylfa Newydd to expand Hitachis nuclear business in the UK. The firm pulled out in January 2019. At the time it said, the project lacked economic rationality as a private company because it was clear that further time was needed to decide on a financing structure for the project, and the conditions for building and operating the nuclear power plants.At one time the UK government offered to take a significant equity stake in the project. However, Hitachi was reportedly spooked by the governments insistence on a fixed price contract without compensation for cost increases and schedule delays. The cancellation of the project punched a 2,700 MW hole in the governments then 19GW plan for new nuclear power plants.GBN is launching the next phase of Great British Nuclears Small Modular Reactor technology selection process. The six eligible companies will now be able toaccess tender documentation, allowing them to bid for potentially multi-billion-pound technology development contracts.Eligible bidders will have until June 2024 to submit their proposals. Successful bidders technologies will be allocated sites and incorporated into projects, and bidders will receive funding to develop their technology. The government promised to make the contract awards before the end of 2024. Successful bidders technologies will be allocated sites and incorporated into projects, and bidders will receive funding to develop their technology.Asannouncedin October 2023, the companies invited to tender are: EDF Energy, GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy International LLC, Holtec Britain Limited, NuScale Power, Rolls-Royce SMR and Westinghouse Electric Company UK Limited. Rolls-Royce has been particularly vocal about delays in the SMR program promoting itself as the home town team for the contract awards. Holtec recently announced a teaming arrangement with South Koreas Hyundai to pursue the contract.If you have an experience or insight to share or have learned something from a conference or seminar, your peers and colleagues on Energy Central want to hear about it.

The pandemic highlighted issues surrounding supply chain resiliency, or the ability of a series of producers and logistics firms to withstand exogenous shocks (e.g., armed conflict, natural disaster). The challenges included panic buying and hoarding, factory closures, shortages of materials and labor, shipping delays and trade protectionism. Consider the difficulty in finding cleaning supplies, personal protective equipment and baby formula.Business leaders and policymakers are clarifying an array of U.S.-based manufacturing opportunities. Cost comparisons have increasingly favored local manufacturing when factoring automation, labor cost comparisons, government incentives and transportation costs. This is impacting an array of industries: defense and aerospace, automotive, electronics, machinery, chemicals, food and beverage, textiles, metals, plastics and rubber, and wood and paper products.Advanced techniques have made possible enhancements in automation, precision, speed, digitization, customization and sustainability. U.S.-based technology enhancements under the term Manufacturing 4.0 are changing the ways business leaders explore procurement opportunities. The technologies include artificial intelligence, robotics and automation, the Internet of Things (IoT), big data and analytics, digital simulation and sustainable production.Policy is an essential aspect of the macro-context within which economic, geopolitical, social and environmental trends impact tech development. As firms write their growth strategy, for both inorganic and organic growth, they evaluate financial returns (i.e., internal rate of return, net present value) for new product investment. This must reflect expectations regarding the future of policy and technology.Opportunity spaces develop, in part, because of technology and policy shifts. Industrial policy can preference those industries deemed a national strategic interest. Areas such as regulation, subsidies, procurement, direct investments and trade policy (i.e., tariffs) affect the capacity of manufacturers to compete for raw materials, employees, customers and private investment. Recent developments (paywall) in U.S. industrial policy have included proposed investments in Greentech, semiconductors and infrastructure.Industrial policy is written to balance social concerns, national security and economic dynamism. Priorities include job creation, wage levels and domestic resiliency. The Whitehouse has developed a comprehensive list of Critical & Emerging Technologies. The list includes advanced computing, advanced engineering materials, advanced gas turbines, advanced and networked sensing and signature management, advanced nuclear energy, autonomous systems, biotechnologies, communication and networking technologies, directed energy, financial technologies, human-machine interfaces, hypersonics, semiconductors and microelectronics, and space technologies and systems.The investment and procurement programs help advance projects by mobilizing public dollars, which catalyze private investment. For example, NASA recently joined us at the University of Richmond to discuss innovation advancements in aerospace technologies, and how the NASA Technology Transform Program helps private citizens commercialize new productsfrom optics to propulsion, and from deep tech to applications in consumer goods.Within the policy context, numerous stakeholders engage in technology development through research. It spans the breadth of engineering (e.g., mechanical, electrical, materials, geological) and combinations of technologies have proven compelling areas of opportunity. These combinations provide new ways to solve problems and extend benefits to target customers. This is applicable for both incremental improvements for existing products, as well as the creation of disruptive new products.For example, AI and blockchain combinations. Dr. Swati Sachan and I recently co-authored Can the Responsible Use of Generative AI be Governed by Blockchains Decentralization and Immutability? as well as No. 1 of the 20 Hot Small Business Trends Todays Leaders are Watching.Emerging areas of innovation through combination include the commercialization of quantum computing applied to both manufacturing and energy. Computational power is being applied for weather modeling and trade route estimation, related risk management, optimization of blended power grids (i.e., small modular reactors, solar and conventional generation) and applications of hydrogen fuel cells. The Financial Times claims that (paywall) the yield curve has yet to deliver a recession because the real curve has only just inverted. And according to Forbes, The yield curve continues to flash a recession warning.First, find emerging revenue opportunities. This includes identifying patterns of new demand, particularly counter-cyclical demand where product development can be enhanced through tech combinations. Generative AI is showing the capacity to enhance R&D initiatives.Second, understand the cost implications. Consider onshore manufacturing as a lower-cost, lower-risk option. The "higher for longer" economic context means related hurdle rates have increased. Advance only the most promising, synergistic product development initiatives.Third, leverage U.S. industrial policy that strengthens innovation and supply chain resilience. Demonstrate commitments to localized manufacturing, built to export products, ESOP plans for employee ownership, partnerships that advance related entrepreneurship and the utilization of incentives to locate in disadvantaged communities (e.g., opportunity zones and enterprise zones).
This was immediately dismissed by Premier Roger Cook, and environmentalists pointed to disasters such as the 2011 accident at the uranium-powered Fukushima nuclear plant as evidence of its inherent danger.However, industry observers say the public often attaches the risks of nuclear power to uranium mining  despite them being separate issues and a viable uranium mining trade could be established if it undertook some reputational repair work.

In Georgia, demand for industrial power is surging to record highs, with the projection of new electricity use for the next decade now 17 times what it was only recently. Arizona Public Service, the largest utility in that state, is also struggling to keep up, projecting it will be out of transmission capacity before the end of the decade absent major upgrades. In Northern Virginia, the equivalent of several new large nuclear power plants are needed to serve all the new data centers planned and under construction. Texas, where electricity shortages are already routine on hot summer days, faces the same dilemma. The soaring demand is forcing electricity providers to scramble to try to squeeze more juice out of America's aging power grid while pushing commercial customers to go to extraordinary lengths to lock down their energy supply needs, such as by helping build their new power plants. When you look at the numbers, it is staggering, said Jason Shaw, chairman of the Georgia Public Service Commission, which regulates electricity. It makes you scratch your head and wonder how we ended up in this situation. How were the projections that far off? This has created a challenge like we have never seen before. The administration of President Joe Biden claims it has made easing the grid bottleneck a priority. Even if this were true, federal powers are limited and the whole process is politically fraught, at best. Building new transmission lines and transfer stations involves huge land acquisitions, exhaustive environmental reviews and negotiations with multiple partners to determine who should pay what costs.Thanks to your generous support, we are building the infrastructure of human freedom and actively donating our technology to independent publishers, authors and home schooling organizations.

Regulators are worried that residential ratepayers could be stuck with the bill for costly upgrades. Climate activists are also concerned that the surging demand for power could stifle the transition to cleaner energy, especially as utility executives continue to lobby government authorities to delay the retirement of fossil fuel plants and bring more online to keep supply stable.Rapid AI innovations driving surge in demand for electricity A major factor behind the skyrocketing demand is the rapid innovation in artificial intelligence, which is driving the construction of large warehouses of computing infrastructure that require exponentially more power than traditional data centers. Tech mogul Elon Musk has even warned that the U.S. could run out of electricity and transformers for AI by 2025. AI is also part of a huge scale-up in cloud computing. Tech firms like Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta and Microsoft are scouring the nation for sites for new data centers, and many lesser-known firms are also on the hunt. (Related: Rosemount, Minnesota trying to establish 15-minute city with the help of Zuckerberg's Meta.) But these same tech giants are also exploring ways in which AI can help make the grid operate more efficiently, such as by developing platforms that, during times of peak power demand, "can shift compute tasks and their associated energy consumption to the times and places where carbon-free energy is available on the grid," said Google in a statement.

Climate activists are also concerned that the surging demand for power could stifle the transition to cleaner energy, especially as utility executives continue to lobby government authorities to delay the retirement of fossil fuel plants and bring more online to keep supply stable.Rapid AI innovations driving surge in demand for electricity A major factor behind the skyrocketing demand is the rapid innovation in artificial intelligence, which is driving the construction of large warehouses of computing infrastructure that require exponentially more power than traditional data centers. Tech mogul Elon Musk has even warned that the U.S. could run out of electricity and transformers for AI by 2025. AI is also part of a huge scale-up in cloud computing. Tech firms like Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta and Microsoft are scouring the nation for sites for new data centers, and many lesser-known firms are also on the hunt. (Related: Rosemount, Minnesota trying to establish 15-minute city with the help of Zuckerberg's Meta.) But these same tech giants are also exploring ways in which AI can help make the grid operate more efficiently, such as by developing platforms that, during times of peak power demand, "can shift compute tasks and their associated energy consumption to the times and places where carbon-free energy is available on the grid," said Google in a statement.

Texas, where electricity shortages are already routine on hot summer days, faces the same dilemma. The soaring demand is forcing electricity providers to scramble to try to squeeze more juice out of America's aging power grid while pushing commercial customers to go to extraordinary lengths to lock down their energy supply needs, such as by helping build their new power plants. When you look at the numbers, it is staggering, said Jason Shaw, chairman of the Georgia Public Service Commission, which regulates electricity. It makes you scratch your head and wonder how we ended up in this situation. How were the projections that far off? This has created a challenge like we have never seen before. The administration of President Joe Biden claims it has made easing the grid bottleneck a priority.

The AI boom is in full swing, with Microsoft and OpenAI teaming up to build a $100 billion AI supercomputer, Amazon planning to spend $150 billion on data centers, and Meta planning to install 50,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs by the end of 2024. These are mind-boggling projects, and with powerful GPU hardware at the heart of them, you can be sure that the power bills will be astronomical.Governments and big tech are aware of the "AI power issue" and are looking at nuclear energy as a potential solution. US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm spoke with Axiom to confirm that it plans to accelerate discussions with companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon to host "small nuclear plants" next to their massive data centers.Nuclear power for data centers is not an outlandish idea. Last year, we reported on Microsoft hiring a Principal Program Manager of Nuclear Technology to implement a Small Modular Reactor (SMR) and microreactor energy strategy.Small Modular Reactor (SMR) technology involves compact and transportable plug-and-play reactors; however, these reactors could still be years away from real-world applications. "How do you bring down that cost so that utilities are willing to take on the risk of SMRs?" Jennifer Granholm said.Building nuclear reactors next to every significant AI data center might sound reactionary. However, nuclear energy is currently the only "clean" energy that can provide the power required by modern AI data centers.Kosta is a veteran gaming journalist that cut his teeth on well-respected Aussie publications like PC PowerPlay and HYPER back when articles were printed on paper.

HOUSTON, Texas  In a video message projected onto massive screens in a packed conference hall, Sultan al-Jaber, the president of the COP28 climate conference held in the United Arab Emirates last year, graciously accepted a leadership award from one of the worlds biggest energy industry conventions.Al-Jaber, who when not running UN climate summits is also the CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, faced criticism from environmental groups for inviting major oil and gas companies to participate in the international climate negotiations. He also faced scrutiny for his comments that its not necessary to eliminate fossil fuels to meet the Paris Agreement target of limiting warming this century to less than 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) by the end of the century. But here in Houston, before a much friendlier crowd, he remained defiant.If the world is going to meet its climate goals, every stakeholder has to act, al-Jaber said, with a model of a wind turbine on his desk. Everyone had a seat at the table, everyone was invited to contribute, and everyone did contribute.It is no exaggeration to say that [al-Jaber] helped the global community chart pathways to a sustainable future, said Daniel Yergin, the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning oil history The Prize and the founder of CERAWeek.While only a sliver of the size of the last climate meeting  more than 8,000 delegates were at CERAWeek compared to more than 80,000 attendees at COP28  the conference represents some of the most powerful companies in the world with trillions of dollars at their disposal to shape the future of global energy and the climate. The theme this year was Multidimensional Energy Transition: Markets, climate, technology and geopolitics.The unwieldy title is an example of how the convention has grown in scope since it started in 1981 and how the industries it represents have begun to redefine their roles in a world constrained by rising average temperatures, yet still primarily dependent on fossil fuels. What was once a low-key meeting of oil and gas executives and analysts to talk frankly and cut deals has become a slick news-making tech conference where attendees are well fed and, after hours, well lubricated by sponsors. Think of it as Davos for the oil and gas set, hosted in the energy capital of the US.Twenty years ago you could not have a conversation here about climate change. Full stop, Mark Brownstein, senior vice president for energy transition at the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), who has attended the conference for decades, told Vox.By now everyone at CERAWeek has gotten the memo on global warming and understood the assignment, at least in rhetoric. The worlds largest energy firms have come to a general consensus that the world is shifting toward clean energy  but that fossil fuels are still going to be necessary for the foreseeable future. These truths are not in conflict, said Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm. The momentum of the clean energy transition is undeniable, even as we are the largest producer of oil and gas in the world.Every talk and panel discussion nodded to the energy transition, toward carbon management, efficiency, and clean tech. When it comes to energy sources  wind, solar, hydropower, natural gas, oil, hydrogen, coal, nuclear, geothermal, and even fusion  CERAWeek has truly embraced diversity, equity, and inclusion.But even with greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere reaching levels not seen in eons and after the hottest year humans have ever measured, the fossil fuel industry whose products are driving climate change sees a bright future for itself. After all, despite the extraordinary expansion of clean energy generation, fossil fuels have only lost a small share of the global energy mix and are still expecting more growth.The majors believe that technologies like carbon capture and storage will allow them to continue selling their wares as emissions regulations ratchet down, and that power-devouring technologies like artificial intelligence and growing markets in developing countries will continue to raise demand. By some estimates, data center electricity use is on track to more than double by 2026. Coal, oil, and natural gas consumption are at or near record highs in many parts of the world and their emissions are currently on track to grow through 2050, according to the Energy Information Administration. The world is hungry for BTUs and watts, and the energy industry is eager to serve them.But that optimism hasnt been matched with urgency on climate change, and the industry has a long history of slowing progress. While the language has changed more recently, the oil and gas industry has spent decades thwarting action on climate change, with lobbying, litigation, and misinformation. Exxons own scientists produced accurate internal forecasts of rising average temperatures as early as the 1970s while the company published full-page ads in newspapers casting doubt on warming into the late 1990s.Russias ongoing invasion of Ukraine has also put energy security back on the front burner. For some countries, energy security today matters more than climate change tomorrow, leading them to prioritize secure sources, including fossil fuels in some cases. (Energy security wasnt the only echo of the war  CERAWeek also helpfully reminded participants in its registration form not to attend if they are subject to sanctions.)So while appetites for cleaner energy sources are growing, the stalwarts of the global energy industry have made it clear they arent letting go of the fuels that powered their rise. As these companies have grudgingly come to acknowledge climate change, many concerned about global warming have also begun to grapple with the likelihood that fossil fuels arent fading away anytime soon. And while most energy companies do envision reducing their greenhouse gas emissions, the current pace is nowhere near fast enough to bend the curve to meet climate goals. The future for the global energy industry is not just brighter, but hotter.Across the skybridge from the hotel in the neighboring convention center, CERAWeek hosts what it calls Innovation Agora, where tech entrepreneurs and energy startups pitch their solutions to climate change in glass-walled booths under purple lights. It was once the kids table of the conference when it launched in 2017 but has since evolved into a parallel production, a clear reflection of clean energys massive growth and immense potential.The fossil fuel industry talks less about competition between conventional sources and renewables and more about collaboration between the molecule and the electron solution set, as Exxons Woods described it. The molecules are the hydrocarbons of coal, oil, and gas and increasingly, hydrogen, while the electrons are those generated by solar panels and wind turbines.Unsurprisingly, the molecule companies have their eyes set on the technologies that play to their strengths. Hydrogen, a gas most commonly produced by reforming methane, fits well into the fossil fuel industrys existing refining, pipeline, storage, and retail infrastructure. Geothermal, which harnesses heat from beneath the Earths surface, draws on the sectors expertise in geology and drilling. Carbon capture  from smokestacks, from the ocean, from the air  gives fossil fuels a way to zero out their emissions, at least on paper, extending them a lifeline in a world where emissions must ratchet down. In the US, the Biden administration has set a target of cutting national greenhouse gas emissions in half compared to 2005 levels by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions by 2050.US government incentives are sweetening the deal for cleaner energy technologies. The trio of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act have mobilized billions of dollars to research, build, and deploy low-emissions energy systems and the products that enable them. Unlike past legislative attempts to tackle climate change, these laws are almost all incentives, with no restrictions or caps on greenhouse gases baked in.As for the villains, the energy industry as well as environmental groups found a common adversary in methane. Its about 30 times more powerful than carbon dioxide when it comes to trapping heat in the atmosphere. Its the dominant component of natural gas, so producers do have an incentive to limit its leaks since its a salable product. At COP28, dozens of oil and gas firms committed to ending their methane pollution by 2050. Simply reducing methane output by 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030 could avert 0.2C of warming (0.36F) by 2050. But methane is colorless and odorless, making it hard to detect where its escaping, and estimates of its emissions vary widely.These concerns have fertilized the growth of the carbon accounting and verification business. Context Labs, one of the companies presenting at the Agora, has developed software so companies can track emissions across their facilities, sometimes down to individual pieces of hardware like generators or furnaces. The goal is to give companies actionable information about where they need to cut pollution, how they can route their operations to be more carbon efficient, and what assets will be at risk when emissions regulations get stricter.Not everyone is ready to take these companies at their word, though. The Environmental Defense Fund launched a satellite to track global methane emissions just a few days before CERAWeek began and advertised it on the streets of Houston. EDF plans to publish its findings publicly to spur polluters to act.There were still points of friction at the oil-soaked conference, as explained by Amin Nasser, president and CEO of Saudi Aramco. Its not just the worlds largest oil company, with nearly four times the market capitalization of ExxonMobil; its the fourth-mightiest of all companies, shaping economies around the world. And as a mostly state-run enterprise under an autocratic regime, Saudi Aramco isnt as swayed by activists or shareholders as a fully investor-owned company like Exxon.The first is that alternatives to hydrocarbons like wind and solar energy have received decades of research and development and billions of dollars in investment, but still hold single-digit market shares. Second, reducing the carbon intensity of fossil fuels  particularly through energy efficiency and switching from coal and oil to natural gas  has delivered greater greenhouse gas emissions reductions than the rise of clean energy. Third is that many alternative energy strategies like electric vehicles are unaffordable for a majority of people around the world. That ties into the fourth point, that most of global energy demand growth in the coming years will occur in developing countries. But despite representing 85 percent of the worlds population, these countries receive a tiny fraction of clean energy investment.Nasser concluded with his fifth point: that the energy transition strategy of replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy needs a reset. We should abandon the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas and instead invest in them adequately, reflecting realistic demand assumptions, Nasser said to widespread applause. We should ramp up our effort to reduce carbon emissions, improve efficiency and introduce lower carbon solutions. And we should phase in new energy sources and technologies when they are genuinely ready, economically competitive, and with the right infrastructure.Many activists and other in the energy industry disagree with Nassers assessment. However, his comments echo the ongoing rifts at COP meetings between major fossil fuel-producing countries that became rich off oil and those often poorer countries facing the immediate effects of climate change like sea level rise, who want to see fossil fuel consumption zeroed out. Its led to long, tortuous negotiations over language like phase down versus phase out and unabated emissions from fossil fuels.But while many zero-carbon technologies are still expensive, so too are the systems required to keep burning coal, oil, and gas in a world where emissions must halt by the middle of the century to meet climate targets. Some of the cheapest carbon capture technologies to date still cost about $40 per metric ton of carbon dioxide, adding up to billions of dollars to capture any meaningful share of the 37.4 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emitted last year.The US, now the worlds largest oil producer and natural gas exporter, is also in an awkward spot. While pledging to reduce its own emissions, the US is anticipating more fossil fuel exports and financing import facilities in other countries. That includes a doubling of liquefied natural gas shipments abroad by 2030, despite the White Houses pause on new export terminals. The whole world needs to transition away from fossil fuels, but in the meantime, we still have to support our friends and allies in their energy needs, John Podesta, the White House climate adviser who also leads climate diplomacy, told reporters.Now in an election year, the Biden administration is trying to walk the line between taking credit for low gasoline prices and facilitating more fossil fuel extraction as it faces a challenger who wants to ramp up coal, oil, and natural gas, potentially adding another 4 billion metric tons by 2030 to the USs already massive greenhouse gas emissions tally.All the while, the era of low interest rates that drove the massive expansion of both renewables and natural gas in the US in the past decade is ending just as the country needs a massive new buildout of energy production and infrastructure. Financing expenses are getting higher while permitting time and costs remain an obstacle, slowing down the shift to cleaner energy. So while the threats from climate change are more apparent than ever, its getting harder to wield the tools to keep it in check, and that means the fuels of the industrial revolution will continue to light the road ahead, for a while at least.At Vox, we believe that clarity is power, and that power shouldnt only be available to those who can afford to pay.

Nikki Haley did pull off an upset victory in Vermont, she will reportedly drop out of the presidential race later this morning. In his Super Tuesday victory speech, Trump stuck to his typically pessimistic tone, and compared the U.S. to a third-world country.MORE: Former President Trump reportedly met with Elon Musk and other wealthy Republican donors over the weekend, though it is not clear whether Musk, the worlds second-richest person, will help Trump close his campaign cash gap with President Joe Biden.OpenAI issued a public rebuttal against Elon Musk, saying it will move to dismiss claims made by the billionaire in a lawsuit accusing the company of abandoning its founding mission in favor of maximizing profits. Were sad that its come to this, the blog post from Tuesday stated, referring to Musk as someone who inspired us to aim higher, then told us we would fail, started a competitor, and then sued us when we started making meaningful progress towards OpenAIs mission without him.Bitcoin sank 12% from its all-time high of $68,925 that the cryptocurrency achieved late Tuesday morning to below $61,000 by late afternoon, heading toward its worst daily decline since November 2022, highlighting a largely dreary day for investors. Equities also took a breather, as the S&P 500 tumbled 1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 1.7% without any major negative economic or earnings catalysts.MORE: The hits keep coming for Apple, as the tech giant's stock fell more than 2% to as low as $169, registering its lowest price since October 31 and notching its fifth consecutive losing session. Apple shares are at a crossroads, declared Rosenblatt analyst Barton Crockett in a Tuesday note to clients, hypothesizing Apple may have lost its luster on Wall Street following its sunsetting of its electric vehicle project and the uninspiring launch of its Vision Pro mixed reality headset.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has finalized a rule that will bring average credit card late fees down from $32 to $8, a move the CFPB estimates will save consumers $10 billion in late fees. But the banking industry is pushing back, arguing that the rule will have knock-on consequences which will ultimately be worse for consumers. If credit card users aren't deterred from paying late by a high fee, then they may miss more payments, resulting in lower credit scores and reduced access to credit, the Bank Policy Institute argues.In 1997, Gregg Hymowitz and a couple of colleagues from Goldman Sachs launched EnTrust Capital with 125 clients and $750 million in assets. Today, EnTrust has grown into a firm with $18.7 billion in assets, and Hymowitz himself is worth $1.7 billion between his 80% stake in EnTrust, his personal investments in EnTrust funds and other assets. In an interview with Forbes, the Long Island native talks about how he built his fortune by buying distressed businesses and partnering with activists like Nelson Peltz.Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ) will not run for reelection and will leave the chamber at the end of the year, she announced Tuesday in a video on social media. Sinema became known for her objection to eliminating the Senate filibuster, which caused headaches for Democrats agenda during President Joe Bidens first two years in office. She then switched her party affiliation from Democratic to independent at the end of 2022.Congressional leaders are introducing a national security bill targeting social media apps, including TikTok, that are owned by companies subject to the control of a foreign adversary. The proposed legislation outlines a process through which the president can designate adversary-owned apps of concern and offer incentives for their owners to divest the app. The goal, sources say, is to allow the apps to stay up and running in the U.S. while tackling ownership issues that could pose privacy and national security risks.Dartmouth Colleges mens basketball team voted 13-2 in favor of unionizing Tuesday, bringing them one step closer to becoming the first undergraduate collegiate athletic team to unionize in the U.S. If players unionize, they could be able to negotiate compensation, travel and practice hours with the school, which has five days to file an objection, according to the National Labor Relations Board.Russian and Chinese officials are considering plans for installing a joint nuclear power plant on the moon's surface within the next decade, the head of Russia's space agency said Tuesday. Nuclear energy on the moon would be able to power future lunar settlements, as modern solar panels would not be able to provide enough electricity, said Yuri Borisov, general director of Russias Roscosmos.Drinking more than 67 ounces of sugary or artificially sweetened beverages a week may increase the risk of developing atrial fibrillationan irregular heartbeatbut organic fruit juices without added sugar may decrease this risk, according to a new study.

But which actors in the crowd made the most money last year?Margot Robbie and Ryan Goslingthe stars of Barbie, which is nominated for eight Oscarsare ranked No. 2 and No. 4 respectively on this years top 10 based solely on their estimated earnings from box office, video on-demand and the movies first streaming window. Their total compensation for starring in the cultural phenomenon will be considerably higher.In total, the 10 highest-paid stars combined to earn $449 million in 2023. They come almost exclusively from movies, rather than television, thanks in part to the writers and actors strikes that shut down Hollywood for half the year and delayed (or shortened) a number of TV seasons, and partially due to the now decades-long precedent that top movie stars can command up to $20 million up front for a single movie plus a percentage of its profits.At the top of the list? None other than 57-year-old funnyman Adam Sandler, who earned an estimated $73 million last year (after paying fees to his agent, manager and lawyer). Since signing his first $250 million four-picture deal with Netflix in 2014, Sandler has starred in eight movies for the streaming giant and produced several more through his Happy Madison production company. The majority of his back catalog of comedies are now licensed on the platform as well. In the first six months of 2023 alone, Netflix subscribers spent more than 500 million hours watching Sandlers movies.WHY IT MATTERS Beyond the hefty salaries, whats truly been earned by this years highest-paid stars is greater power within the industry, particularly the ability to negotiate for even more favorable deal terms on their next project. In an industry where pay can rise or fall based on each performance, this list represents a snapshot of who has the most leverage in Hollywood in 2024.The University of Iowa womens basketball game against Ohio State University over the weekendin which Iowa's Caitlin Clark broke the all-time NCAA scoring recordwas the most-watched regular season women's basketball game in 25 years, according to Fox:5.18 million: The average number of viewers watched the men's Michigan State-Arizona game on Thanksgiving, the only regular season college basketball game this season that had a higher viewership than the Iowa women's game, according to Sports Media WatchCongress has quite a lot on its to-do list, including a number of potential changes that could affect federal taxes for 2023. Heres a detailed rundown on pending legislation, plus guidance on whether it makes sense to hold off on filing. Taxpayers with children who qualify for the child tax credit, for instance, should not wait on Congress, but businesses that issue a Form K-1, or individuals who expect to get one, should plan on filing for an extension and waiting to see what happens.Scientists at the New England Aquarium in Boston said on Tuesday they spotted a rare gray whale in the waters south of Nantucket, a shocking sighting of a species thought to have been extinct in the Atlantic for over 200 years. While not endangered, gray whales are found almost exclusively in what part of the world?


Matthew Szydagis, 41, has spent the last two years toiling in a laboratory deep beneath the University of Albany campus, blasting bits of lithium with ion beams to test the nature of its fission reactions.The physics professor discovered that lithium, commonly used in cellphone batteries used in phones, cars, and other technologies, only becomes fissionable when hit by the ions  and stabilizes when the beams stop.The concept is to have fission that you can turn on and turn off, Szydagis told The Post. Thats what really creates the incredible safety factor and makes it completely different from standard nuclear power.All of our nuclear power plants were created after the Manhattan Project and after the bomb. So the only way we knew how to make nuclear energy was to take the same technology and same ideas from bombs, Szydagis said, explaining that uranium has remained the standard fuel in nuclear plants throughout their history.Szydagis model could also potentially negate the dangers of uranium waste created from standard nuclear reactors. Unlike uranium, which can take almost a billion years to no longer be radioactive, fissioned lithium takes a matter of hours, minutes, worst case days or weeks to become safe.Though only tested on small samples so far, if Szydagis lithium-based model scales as he expects it would have the potential to replace uranium in reactors across the world  and possibly eliminate the public safety fears that have prevented the clean energy source from powering the entire planet.The beauty of nuclear power  any nuclear power, my idea as well as traditional uranium-based plants  is that they can be built with nearly zero carbon footprint and run with nearly zero CO2 output, he said.Szydagis believes that a climate change cataclysm has already begun and estimates that New York City will be underwater by 2100 if nothing is done to prevent it. However, if successful, his lithium-based nuclear energy could have an enormous impact on keeping future generations safe.Ill put it very bluntly  someone sitting in New York may not end up underwater anymore in 50 years if his idea succeeds, he explained. So I would say thats a pretty big impact: to not have Manhattan become the next lost city of Atlantis.Dark matter hunters spend their time creating neutrons to throw at detectors  something the University of Albanys subterranean particle collider is uniquely equipped for  and during such experimentation with his team Szydagis struck on the lithium idea.The process remains in its early stages. Szydagis has a patent pending and is looking for funding to expand the size of his experiments, which he will then write up into a paper for peer review and then look at further expansion.Im not claiming any new physics. Im not saying Ive got some crackpot zero point energy or some magical thing that doesnt actually exist  Im doing bread and butter, nuclear fission thats been understood for many, many decades.

As mentioned, many Nepalese men have also been duped into becoming cannon fodder for the fascist Russian army, promised good monthly wages only to find themselves thrown into the Ukraine front with no military training nor knowledge of Russian. Gutless of the Russians to do this.There are Youtube videos of Indians bragging about how much they are earning as mercenaries. They went to Russia on tourist visas with the plan to illegally find jobs, and joined as mercenaries willingly.No one is lured into military action by force or deception. People come on their own to earn money, and when they want to go home and the contract is not yet completed, they start crying. In Russia there are many Russian strong guys who can and do work outside the combat zone. The cities of Mariupol, Donetsk, Lugansk, etc. are being rebuilt.

The largest uranium producer in the United States is ramping up work just south of Grand Canyon National Park on a long-contested project that comes as global instability and growing demand drive uranium prices higher.The Biden administration and dozens of other countries have pledged to triple the capacity of nuclear power worldwide in their battle against climate change, and policy changes are being adopted by some to lessen Russia's influence over the supply chain.But as the U.S. pursues its nuclear power potential, environmentalists and Native American leaders remain fearful of the consequences for communities near mining and milling sites in the West and are demanding more regulatory oversight.The new mining at Pinyon Plain Mine near the Grand Canyon is happening within the boundaries of the Baaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukv National Monument that was designated in August by President Joe Biden. The work was allowed to move forward since Energy Fuels Inc. had valid existing rights.The mine will cover 6.8 hectares (16.8 acres) and operate for just a few years, producing about 907,000 kilograms (about 2 million pounds) of uranium  enough to power the state of Arizona for at least a year with carbon-free electricity, he said.Energy Fuels, which also is prepping two more mines in Colorado and Wyoming, was awarded a contract in 2022 to sell $18.5 million in uranium concentrates to the U.S. government to help establish the nation's strategic reserve for when supplies might be disrupted.Amid the growing appetite for uranium, a coalition of Native Americans testified before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in late February, asking the panel to pressure the U.S. government to overhaul outdated mining laws and prevent further exploitation of marginalized communities.Carletta Tilousi, who served for years on the Havasupai Tribal Council, said she and others have written countless letters to state and federal agencies and have sat through hours of meetings with regulators and lawmakers. Her tribe's reservation lies in a gorge off the Grand Canyon.Numerous legal challenges aimed at stopping the Pinyon Plain Mine repeatedly have been rejected by the courts, and top officials in the Biden administration are reticent to weigh in beyond speaking generally about efforts to improve consultation with Native American tribes.It's just the latest battle over energy development and sacred lands, as tribes in Nevada and Arizona are fighting the federal government over the mining of lithium and the siting of renewable energy transmission lines.The Havasupai are concerned mining could affect water supplies, wildlife, plants and geology throughout the Colorado Plateau, and the Colorado River flowing through the Grand Canyon and its tributaries are vital to millions of people across the West.The Pinyon Plain Mine, formerly known as the Canyon Mine, was permitted in 1984. With existing rights, it was grandfathered into legal operation despite a 20-year moratorium placed on uranium mining in the Grand Canyon region by the Obama administration in 2012.The U.S. Forest Service in 2012 reaffirmed an environmental impact statement that had been prepared for the mine years earlier, and state regulators signed off on air and aquifer protection permitting within the last two years.Using nuclear power to reach emissions goals is a hard sell in the western U.S. From the Navajo Nation to Ute Mountain Ute and Oglala Lakota homelands, tribal communities have deep-seated distrust of uranium companies and the federal government as abandoned mines and related contamination have yet to be cleaned up.Teracita Keyanna with the Red Water Pond Road Community Association got choked up while testifying before the human rights commission in Washington, D.C., saying federal regulators proposed keeping onsite soil contaminated by past operations in New Mexico rather than removing it."It's really unfair that we have to deal with this and my children have to deal with this and later on, my grandchildren have to deal with this," she said. "Why is the government just feeling like we're disposable. We're not."Congresswoman Cori Bush of Missouri said during a congressional meeting in January that lawmakers can't talk about expanding nuclear energy in the U.S. without first dealing with the effects that nuclear waste has had on minority communities. In Bush's district in St. Louis, waste was left behind from the uranium refining required by the top-secret Manhattan Project.
An African woman prepares traditional injera bread in her home in Berhale, Ethiopia. Climate alarmists anti-fossil fuel mania would keep those like her in the Third World from ever enjoying the modernity of electricity and thereby keep them cooking and heating their homes by burning wood and dried dung. Reliance on those methods exposes her and millions of others around the world to harmful fumes, leading to serious health issues, such as lung disease, blindness, and premature death. (Photo: Roberto Moiola/Sysaworld/ Moment/Getty Images)We all want a future where humans can thrive in a clean environment. But as the eye-opening documentary Climate the Movie: The Cold Truth reveals, while we hear dire warnings that we must rapidly eliminate fossil fuels to avoid a climate catastrophe, we are manufacturing a humanitarian crisis of our own.That means maintaining an energy mix that can handle natures curveballs. It means maximizing our options, not banning entire categories of energy the world still needs. But as environmentalists seek to ban fossil fuels, they are raising the price of electricity for some and depriving others in emerging economies of that valuable resource.The movie aired on YouTube the same week that the Environmental Protection Agency issued final regulations requiring 70% of new cars sold to be hybrid or battery-powered electric by 2032. But that raises costs and inconveniences households for no gain, because banning fossil fuels in America would not affect global temperatures.Despite headlines about worsening hurricanes, data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows no long-term increase in the frequency or intensity of U.S. hurricanes since records began being kept in the mid-1800s.For the worlds poorest nations, giving up fossil fuels is catastrophic. Affordable, dependable power is a life-or-death matter when it comes to delivering basic needs, such as health care, sanitation, safe drinking water, and protection from heat waves and cold snaps.Germanys renewable-energy mandates have driven consumer prices to more than triple the levels seen in the United States. This entirely avoidable situation places a heavy burden on German businesses, unnecessarily increasing their operating costs.By all means, lets use renewable technologies as they become reliable and cost-effective, including nuclear energy. Attempting to legislate an accelerated transition is a recipe for disaster when reality collides with wishful thinking.This is a critical year in the history of our country. Americans are polarized and divided. Roughly half of the country is clamoring for socialist policies like more government control over health care, increased regulations, and open borders.

The House bill [H.R. 6544] would also extend the Price-Anderson federal accident insurance subsidy, first enacted in 1957 and renewedseven timessince then. The program expires at the end of 2025. It isnt clear why this federal subsidy for nuclear in still needed when the industry insists its new, advanced reactor designs are inherently walk-away safe.The U.S. nuclear industry in recent days has hit three cherries on the federal money-and-policy slot machine. The open question is whether the largess (some might call itpork) will have the intended results: revitalizing a moribund industry by hitching its wagon to the feverish fear of climate change and long-run animosity toward nuclear rivals China and Russia.First, the moneythe most tangible of the goodies Congress and the White House have doled out. On March 5, the ranking members of the House and Senate appropriations committees rolled out a consensus on six money balls, including theEnergy and Water Development and Related Agencies billfunding all government nuclear programs for fiscal year 2024. Passage is almost certainly a done deal.On February 28, the House by an overwhelming 365-36 bipartisan margin passedH.R. 6544, designed to streamline safety reviews by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and give the Department of Energy some authority to buy electricity through purchase power agreements from commercial nuclear power purveyors.In some respects, the legislation is a return to the approach of the now-defunct Atomic Energy Commission in the early days of atomic energy. In 1974,Congress abolished the AEC, and the all-power congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, in large part because the AEC viewed reactor safety as a poor cousin to promotion the atom.to ensure that, while upholding the policies of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA), the licensing and regulation of nuclear activities are carried out efficiently without unduly restricting the potential of nuclear energy and to improve the general welfare and the benefits of nuclear technology to society.Some observers have suggested this hortatory language is unlikely to survive in the Senate. Senators are trying to combine House provisions with a separate bipartisan bill that passed last year as part of the National Defense Authorization Act but was later axed.The legislation would also create a cadre of up to 210 Supergrade nuclear ninjas, possibly paid more than NRC commissioners in some cases. According to the bill language, under some circumstances, the NRC chairman Chairman may, during any period when such a certification is in effect, fix the compensation for such employees or other personnel serving in a covered position without regard to any provision of title 5, United States Code, governing General Schedule classification and pay rates. These alleged experts appear to have the power to second-guess the Senate-confirmed commissioners.The House bill would also extend the Price-Anderson federal accident insurance subsidy, first enacted in 1957 and renewedseven times since then. The program expires at the end of 2025. It isnt clear why this federal subsidy for nuclear in still needed when the industry insists its new, advanced reactor designs are inherently walk-away safe. Congress apparently believes it can assess the risks of nuclear energy more accurately than private sector actuaries.On March 4, the NRC rejected a staff-written draft rule developed over three years for how to regulate the potential new license applications for a variety of advanced reactors. The commission told the staff to rewrite its proposal for a new Part 53 section of the agencys authority embodied in 10 Code of Federal Regulations, joining the current sections 50 and 52, which pertain to large light-water reactors.According to Utility Dive, a key change ordered by the commission rejected a strict checklist of requirements for probabilistic risk assessments while favoring a more flexible framework suited to simplified reactor designs with passive safety features that utilize natural forces, such as gravity or pressure differentials, rather than operator action.In a news release, NRC Chairman Christopher Hanson said, This proposed rule leverages significantly more risk insights than our existing regulatory framework in making safety determinations. Applicants can use our existing regulations today, but this proposed rule will provide future nuclear developers a clear, additional pathway for licensing. The NRC said it expects to publish the new rule in the Federal Register in about six months.This latest effort to revive the largely stagnant U.S. nuclear program is the third time in the last nearly 20 years that the government has tried to pump new life into atomic power. The U.S. program started grinding to a halt in the mid-1970s and was barely treading water by the 1990s. The pipeline of new reactor licenses emptied in 1974, and as the final builders of plants under construction either completed or abandoned their projects, the workforce and supply chain infrastructure hollowed out.In 2005, Congress passed a new Energy Policies Act, which offered a smorgasbord of financial goodies for new plants including loans (they called them loan guarantees to make them look more palatable to opponents of direct federal subsidies, but the Treasury wrote the checks and received the loan payments), cost overrun protections, and extension of Price-Anderson to 2025.The 2005 act was largely a failure. The two preeminent U.S. nuclear power developers, Westinghouse and General Electric, ended up sorely financially injured and in Japanese hands. Former NRC CommissionerPeter Bradford commented, They placed a big bet on this hallucination of a nuclear renaissance.Then came the first push for small modular reactors, designed to downsize the financial risks and construction costs of nuclear power plants. The strategy was the reverse of the economies of scale that drove the first generation of nuclear power plants, where bigger was always assumed to be better, but wasnt.In 2009, reactor vendor Babcock & Wilcox, which had substantial experience building nuclear power plants for U.S. submarines, announced it would offer a 125-MW pressurized water reactor (later scaled up to 180 MW) and a year later unveiled an alliance with builder Bechtel Corp. They called the project mPower.In 2012, the Obama administration announced a $500 million program for development of small modular reactors. In 2013, mPower won financial assistance from DOE, with an award up to around $126 million. The same year, B&W tried and failed to sell a majority share of mPower, then cut back funding by 75%. Bechtel soon soured on the project, and it officially ran out of steam in 2017 after failure to find a customer.Will the latest government attempt to revive nuclear, driven by global warming concerns, succeed? Its not a given. Theres lots to like about smaller nukes. They produce no CO2, have a relatively small footprint, can be sited fairly close to load.But the economics arent clear, as theNuScale sagademonstrates. Some of the non-LWR advanced reactor designs will present licensing challenges, as there is little history behind them. Sodium cooled fast reactors may be particularly problematic, given the well-known problems of sodium as a coolant and the experience with Superphenix in France and Monju in Japan, plus issues of nuclear weapons proliferation.During my tenure as CEO of a uranium exploration company (Calypso Uranium) I was an officially designated representative of Argentina at the 2005 IAEA Semi-Annual Redbook International Symposium, in Vienna, Austria (IAEA Headquarters).  The proceedings were published as: Uranium production and raw materials for the nuclear fuel cycle-Supply and demand, economics, the environment and energy security (my name is on p.333).  This gave me an opportunity to question leading experts in all phases of the nuclear issue, and the bottle-neck soon became clear.  The Critical Path, for construction and commissioning a nuclear power reactor, was not predictable, due to constant environmentalist lawsuits and the dramatic changes in politics associated with election cycle results.  The result, failure to assemble a realistic economic analysis, was a Fatal Flaw.  All of the above report, encouraging as it is, needs to address the lawfare assault on Nuclear Energy, or the advances will be only in totalitarian regimes.As a consumer, this is not a political or environmental issue for me. It is all about what is the biggest dollar win in the cheapest energy input.  Since I live in PA where there is enormous NG reserves, I am going to be dubious about Nuke guys blaming environmentalists for their inability to tell me they have a better deal for me.  Frack on!Theres lots to like about big and small nukes but the fact that they produce no CO2 isnt an example  its irrelevant. In fact, if anything, its a drawback of nuclear energy  increased CO2 has already increased plant growth all over the world.Any facility that pumps liquids, involves rotating machinery and produces or uses electricity must be maintained. Parts that wear out are replaced, newer versions are installed. A nuclear generator could easily be operational for many decades with programmed maintenance, as they are today. Licensing them for a specific time period flies in the face of reality. Homeowners dont walk away from a house with a worn out washing machine, plumbing problems or a leaky roof, they fix them.When innovators interfere by discovering cost-effective approaches, first you find some troubling concern with their technology, and if that fails, discover that the risk was worse than we thought and adjust the regulatory limits down to half of what the new technology can achieve.STILL repeating the same old -same old from the 1940s  mankind does _not_learn very fast. We really need some new thinkers on the scene, but I ask you, who or how or WHERE will the mold (mould for Brits) be broken? Universities teach the same staid approach that has us in the present quagmire thinking/implementations that have not progressed since the 1940s . we are truly STUCK since big science will ONLY fund what big sci has FUNDED before. NO new thinking/presentation of theory (esp at a low level concerning even the electron and its relationship to the nucleus) is allowed.You couldnt be more wrong. Big science is an arm of government, the impetus for carbon sequestration, hydrogen combustion, solar power and wind farms, all experiments that are subsidized by taxes or enpixelated funds.Enpixelated funds are monetary units created by keystrokes without going through mining and minting or even printing. They are abstractions and do not exist in the observable world yet are accepted as payment for debts. Many businesses do not accept real money, only enpixelated funds, despite the phrase on fiat paper federal reserve notes, this note is legal tender for all debts, public and private, Of course these businesses should be shunned by all but internet commerce requires enpixelated funds and their convenience ensnares the modern who regards the pre-digital era as a hopeless social and economic antique of the past.Fiat currency is what I would call an unreliable store of value. It is real money because it is fungible and accepted as legal tender in most scenarios. Its unreliable because it is easily and persistently debased.Its a real word if someone uses it and others understand it. Most people would probably figure it out if they thought about it a little. Gold or silver has a value anywhere and always has. US Confederate notes, Wiemar German bills and Zimbabwean notes are valueless except as curiosities. Gold coins were used by the Romans to pay their troops because they were accepted everywhere and those troops were stationed all over the Empire. Before and after the American revolution almost any gold or silver coins were accepted in trade as well as coins from the UK.Im just saying that all forms of money depend on supply and demand setting the price of the money.  Gold is useful as money because it is rare, it doesnt corrode, and the quantity mined annually is small compared to the total amount already in circulation. It is very difficult to create new supplies of gold. Therefore it can be a relatively stable store of value.The true value of money is tied to the goods and services produced in an economy. While you may consider gold a good when used to make jewelry, in the form of bullion it has no useful function other than to be a stable store of value. People agree to accept it in exchange for goods and services because they know that nobody can create new gold to debase its value and they know that everybody else accepts it as payment.The value we talk about is really how many goods and services can be obtained with the exchange of a certain weight of gold. If two starving people were in a village where one had a piece of bread and the other had a bar of gold, both people would want the bread, and the gold would be worthless.The real price of money is how many useful goods and services you need to supply to receive a unit of currency, how many loaves of bread or hours of labor do you need to get a gold coin?  If there is too much money chasing the same goods and services, there will be price inflation. The same unit of currency buys less.if there was a massive meteorite of pure gold that increased the worlds gold supply by 20%, that would depress the price of gold, the same as if a government suddenly added 20% to the supply of fiat currency. Of course thats highly unlikely to happen.Funding research is paying for effort irrespective of results. Effort that private companies wont fund because the probability of technical or commercial success or the cost-benefit analysis makes no sense.Researchers are people. Why struggle with a difficult problem for 70-80 hrs/week when you get no more pay than if you plod along or even slack off?  If they are getting paid a secure salary regardless of whether they succeed or fail, some of them spend their 40 hours browsing porn, or commenting on X.Im not saying that it is never in the national interest to invest in basic research. What I am saying is that when the research aims toward a practical application, there must be powerful incentives to achieve the goal.If you want a bunch of functioning frantabulators, its probably far more effective for the government to promise to buy the first working prototype for whatever had been contemplated as the cost of research grants, and to buy the first x frantabulators delivered by any maker on a decreasing pricing scale. That is how you incentivize timely results and remove commercial risk.Subsidies are not what is needed. End all the frivolous lawsuits is what is needed. As soon as they file one arrest ALL involved for insurrection, lock their asses in rundown DC jail and then wait 3 years to give them trials.Grandpas and grandmas taking selfies, and FBI + AntiFa agitators,  and no guns , hardly constitutes an attempt to overthrow the government.   Why did Speaker Pelosi refuse additional manpower for security?And tell me, why was the J6 riot allowed to happen? The Capital Police knew there was going to be trouble, so did the FBI. Trump asked for 20,000 National Guardsmen to assist with crowd and riot control. Why was that not granted?Nobody said Trump signed an order.  He offered the troops to Pelosi, and she turned them down.  If Trump was half the dictator the socialists claim he is, he would have just overrode Pelosi and sent the troops anyway.I am of two minds on this. Ignoring troll-bots like Lusername might allow its mind-numbed nonsense to go unchallenged. On the other hand, its probably best if instead of acknowledging its nonsense we  just down-vote and in a separate comment make the case for the realist point of view just once, refusing to engage in a back-and-forth with a robot.I worked on the cancelled Summer 2/3 project in South Carolina. It wasnt frivolous lawsuits that killed the project. It was Westinghouse incompetence that made a predictable construction schedule impossible and caused costs to spiral out of control. The sister project in Georgia was able to survive because they were a bigger company and took the federal loan guarantees.In that case, what was supposed to be a $10 billion project ended up around $30 billion.Until a reactor vendor comes up with a design and builds the prototype on a predictable schedule at a competitive cost and shows that it can be operated reliably and economically, no one in their right mind will risk their money on it.Until a reactor vendor comes up with a design and builds the prototype on a predictable schedule at a competitive cost and shows that it can be operated reliably and economically, no one in their right mind will risk their money on it.  Yes, and with the endless stream of frivolous lawsuits against nuclear industry when will that happen? Hell, DoE, DoJ and BLM/DoI are participating in the dog pile of frivolous crap.Who on Earth came up with the idea, let alone signed it off?  In short, it is the pride flag applied to the Cross of St. George and it isnt inclusive, its an insult. If a nations flag doesnt include someone, then, that someone has a problem all their own.No strat, youre wrong. Since 1707 the national flag of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland has been the Union jack or flag. The cross of St. George, the Welsh dragon flag and the cross of St. Andrew (or saltire) are not national flags but can be (and have been) used as unofficial flags of national identity and thats fine. But what it is not is the national flag of England, ok?I suppose that the antiquated thinking would refer to identifying as British. I must confess that I dont understand the nuance there. I am a Connecticutian, a New Englander, a US citizen, an American, and a Terran. Being from Connecticut doesnt override my American-ness.So thats why Microsoft is hiring nuclear engineers, eh chumly. Your sad tears will be mocked when your woke corporate masters start building a lot of nuke plants. Even if they are woke like you they are not stupid and realize unreliables cant run their cash cow cloud business data centers. Even a caveman can see it.Entering a market with new SMR technology where wind and solar has a huge political constituency built on receiving tax credits and other incentives worth $100s of billions presents a challenge for the inevitable nuclear renaissance. The only question is how long we want to keep pretending that sunshine and breezes can power a modern society.Seems to be many new nuclear job postings by G&Ts with nuclear in their portfolios.  Graybeards in the industry will likely have the opportunity to make lots of money.  Hopefully there are enough around to pass on their knowledge and expertise to the next generation.Using the Levelized Full System Costs of Electricity (LFSCOE) comparison method, wind plus infrastructure plus battery storage are over twice the cost of an equivalent nuclear power plant. Solar plus battery storage is over 3 times more expensive.Yet our politicians pursue a strategy of HOPE that some magical fairy dust will drop battery and transmission line costs down to virtually nothing or hydrogen electrolysis, a technology known for over 230 years but still 10 times more expensive that natural gas on a heat equivalent basis, will make their current generation preferences cost effective.Captain, As you state, our politicians pursue a strategy of HOPE that some magical fairy dust will drop battery and transmission line costs down to virtually nothing. Actually, if the batteries were free grid scale battery storage for more than four (4) hours would still be too expensive; as I suspect you fully understand. The associated packet cost for enclosure, overcurrent protection, switchgear, fire suppression and more costs $200/KWh of the $500+total packet.There is plenty of Hydrocarbon fuel in the world to wait for the new energy tech that will truly demand destruct the Hydrocarbon markets. Classic nuke power is very expensive old tech. Do your homework on the capital costs and subsidy costs of nuke power.I can see nuke power application in areas where there isnt a ample supply of natural gas pipelines but wholesale tax subsidized transition to nuke power is unnecessary and capital costs make it more expensive than multi-tiered NG powered generation.If it aint broken dont fix it.  In the long run, the nuke power noise will be quenched by the rad environmentalists and the Big energy arm into Washington.  There will be no major transition to nuke power.If the GOP wants to do good, make the hydrocarbon fuel markets free of collusion and ensure that emerging tech like ambient SC, fusion do not get suppressed. Stop our politicians from being leveraged to make people pay through the nose for hydrocarbon fuel and stop with this nuke non-sense.In 50 years or less the hydrocarbon market question will be moot due to emerging tech that will demand destroy the market. Isnt this the crux of the issue now anyway.. By then it will be something else like under population and transition to anti-human economy.The current political goal is not to end the hydrocarbon fuel markets. it is to leverage them and maintain the cash cow while wielding the propaganda weapon to instigate a dystopic anti-human world view that will lead significant depopulation in the 50 year interimthat is to ensure that we continue to consume and pay through the nose as we age out and disappear.Thats the funny thing about Emergent Technologies that are at least 50 years down the road, they havent emerged yet and cant be predicted. This is the same trap that the idiots pushing Wind and Solar as well as Lithium batteries have fallen into  lets go with this, a miracle will occur, then itll all be rosy. No miracle has occurred in the last 50 years so what makes you think itll happen in the next 50?Agree, cost benefit analysis has become an big moving target in the past 4-5 years on the internet. My reading indicates the the capital costs 14 times greater than NG fired plants  putting the cost benefit win on the multi-tier NG electrical generation not nuke. This is especially true we there is a good supply distribution of NG which is a good chunk of the USA..  So it makes no sense to replace existing NG plants with nuke plants.What we need is CNG cars not EVs. EVs with the tax subsidy are crazy expensive. think about the impact of all that taxpayer money going down the drain for Lithium batteries that are useless in 10 years or less.  The people who are pushing for nuke and EVs are an economic wrecking crew.Taxpayer subsidized items like humungous sports stadiums are tech as old as Imperial Rome but still go up on a regular basis in Yankeeland and other wealthy neighborhoods. These expensive monstrosities are actually just big television studios but television itself is old tech, depending on your technological time line. The Nautilus was launched in 1954 but were unaware of improvements to its nuclear propulsion system in the 70 years since, if any, because of paranoid secrecy.Which leads to the issue of nuclear generation construction cost, a significant part of which is hardening the facility against an attack. Nuclear plants are engineered to make them as impervious to a suicidal aircraft or bomb as possible, since the success of the US is deemed to make every significant technological technique it embraces a target of barbarian hordes whose jealousy inspires destruction.Tax subsidies for nuke power are pointless and backwards. Nuke is zero gain over fossil fuel. In the same way renewables are a negative gain compared to multi- tiered natural gas electrical generation.  This is true for a simple reason; natural gas if the cheaper option.  This is true even in the era of global hydrocarbon glut and massive global hydrocarbon fuel collusion artificially propping up fuel prices leveraging war and the climate change hysteria.  I think many people on WUWT think the political movement of climate change and global press of hydrocarbon fuel prices would be solved by nuke it wont be.  It is a political problem not a tech problem.  The rad environmentalists who are covertly funding much of the climate change propaganda have a bigger agenda than the world existing hydrocarbon fuel.  They want greater centralization of power and they will leverage everything to achieve it including partnering sideways with the darlings of Davos Big Oil to achieve it.  Frack On!  These are the same people who have built their massive careers generating consumer tech that we paid and invested in with our IRA and 401Ks..which enabled the massive centralization of information, discourse and markets.The question of tech that has been emerging since 1966  (Ambient SC, cold fusion Solar, SC electrical generation, AI Quantum computing, SC motors, fuel Cells, AI, Internet, Flat Screen TVs. Cell phones, person computers etc.). All this emerging tech was conceptualized in the 1960s and early 70s.anyone hanging out at Cal Tech and MIT would have heard the dreamers working up prototypes and conceptualizing a new world with new tech. And if you were hanging out at some of the top law schools you would have heard about the coming threat to human privacy and other threats to democracy empowered by coming socially integrated computer systems. The fear what that these new systems would threaten representative power via greater and greater centralization of discourse, information, distribution of good and services and markets.I lived in the vortex of these developments in D.C. in those days. My Father being a top systems analyst and cold warrior and my friends at MIT and Georgetown, UVA, and  Georgia, law and John Hopkins computer labs and me working as a research assistant.What caught the imagination of investors was consumer tech because of its power and potential to penetrate personally into the lives of everyone globally creating enormous efficiencies and wealth. A massive revolution of consumers paying for consumable (non-capital) tech creating the capital for global centralization of information, discourse and markets  Remember, we bought the products and provide the data which provided the capital for the systems we have today.double cash for the Tech world.What didnt capture the imagination of investors or government subsidies is emerging energy infrastructure tech .. .except solar, which is useless without viable affordable ambient SCMCS. Additionally, fusion is also being dependent on viable affordable ambient SC.So the lynch pin for truly innovative energy infrastructure tech for highly efficient electrical generation and distribution and eventually fusion got lost in the shuffle or suppressed. This is the lynch pin that would have significantly demand destructed the hydrocarbon fuel markets and weakened the global currency of oil as a weapon of powerEven this past summer we saw the science media completely destroy a purported ambient superconductor LK-99 in 2-3 weeks. How is this science? Since then, there have been glimmers of hope for LK-99 that you have to search high and low for or manipulate a AI chat system to reveal. LOL which is fun BTW.Is this the environment that a new Ambient SC will emerge. heck no.  It doesnt matter if LK-99 was a total goof. The message is clear to anyone doing this researchwatch your step or you will be crushed. Compare this to the endless bogus climate propagandized science the science media puts out the same journals that crushed LK-99 in 3 weeks. Read between the lines and you get my point.ToldYouSo, hasnt anyone told you that yes, nuclear requires materials of construction, but it is less mineral intensive by orders of magnitude at >90% capacity factor and 60-year life cycle vs solar at a<30% CF and 30-year lifecycle? What about battery storage forever being too expensive for more than four (4) hours? No one ever told you about that either?High-level nuclear waste consists largely of spent fuel from nuclear reactors. Though it makes up a small proportion of overall waste volumes, it accounts for the majority of radioactivity. This most potent form of nuclear waste, according to some, needs to be safely stored for up to a million years. Yes, 1 million years  in other words, a far longer stretch of time than the period since Neanderthals cropped up. This is an estimate of the length of time needed to ensure radioactive decay.And nobody has yet given a satisfactory answer to the question of what to do with thousands of metric tonnes of high-level nuclear waste, some of which can remain radioactive, and thereby lethal, for up to 300,000 years. Nowhere in the world has anyone managed to create a place where we can bury extremely nasty nuclear waste forever, says Denis Florin, partner at Lavoisier Conseil, an energy-focused management consultancy in Paris. We cannot go on using nuclear without being adult about the waste, without accepting we need to find a permanent solution.As discussed in the referenced article, France, like all other countries with commercial scale nuclear power plants, is just kicking the can down the road when it comes with how to handle and eventually store/dispose of high level nuclear waste from such reactors.In a process pioneered by France, many of the uranium, plutonium and fission chemicals have been reprocessed into new fuel at the La Hague site, while waste chemicals that cannot be reused have been vitrified, or turned into glass, for short-term storage in shallow sites underground.Well no it doesnt does it? The spent fuel rods are no longer waste after reprocessing so the amount of waste to be dealt with is vastly reduced, not increased. There will always be something that needs to be disposed of with nuclear fission but reprocessing is a way of reducing that waste by a considerable amount as well as reducing the amount of raw fuel that needs to be mined. More efficient.Uhhhh . . . I believe the statement in the Financial Times article I linked about the process itself creates yet more radioactive waste refers to the fact that, in the reprocessing of spent fuel rods, a portion of the reprocessing facility itself (e.g., plumbing, containment vessels, rod handling equipment, storage drums, etc.) becomes radioactive, known as induced radioactivity.  Also, the more radioactive waste certainly includes the chemical waste stream of fluids used in in cutting operations to open the sealed fuel rods and in chemically separating the various isotopes contained therein.Radioisotopes with short half-lives are dangerous for the straightforward reason that they can dose you very heavily (and fatally) in a short time. Such isotopes have been the main causes of radiation poisoning and death after above-ground explosions of nuclear weapons . . .Long-term isotopes are more complicated. They dont dose as heavily, but there are a lot more issues than just that. Plutonium for example is comparatively long-lived, but some of its decay products can be quite nasty . . .The biggest danger from radioisotopes with mid-to-long half lives is that they can keep an entire region of earth nastily radioactive for a very long time, e.g. hundreds or thousands or even tens of thousand of years. Thats the main reason why disposing of reactor wastes, which often contain just such isotopes, is such a contentious issue.Those nukes have cooling towers which emit huge plumes of dihydrogen monoxide. Dihydrogen monoxide is the most powerful greenhouse gas. And it kills 4000 people every year in the U.S. and thousands more worldwide. So maybe we should ban it?The base line of liability for any incorporated business is the capital of the corporation. Once the capital is exhausted, claims cannot be paid. So, if claims exceeded the capital of the utility, it could file a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding in Federal court and the claimants would be paid a prorata portion of their claims. Ex-hypotheis, the utilitys assets were destroyed in the incident and its capital would therefor be severely impaired.PAA addressed this problem by imposing on nuclear plant operators an obligation to purchase liability insurance. It allowed the creation of an entity, n/k/a American Nuclear Insurers, which is a pool of large domestic property-casualty insurance and reinsurance companies, to sell the coverage. The required insurance is now $450 million.But, wait there is more. If the damages exceed $450 million, every licensed nuclear plant operator is required to contribute to a fund to pay those claims up to $131 million. The total amount of these contributions is currently about $12.9 billion. There is an additional required surcharge if those funds are depleted of up to 5% of the original contribution. The act provides for federal court jurisdiction to prioritize payments.Does the act protect the utility companies? Not really. They are protected by their corporate charters. No, it protects the rate payers from being forced to pay extra to replenish the utilitys capital so that it can stay in business. It also creates an industry funded mechanism for paying claims promptly and fulsomely.So, where is the subsidy? There isnt any. The Act makes the industry pay for insurance.The Federal Government is not required to pay anything. https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/nuclear-insurance.htmlNumber two, list the energy sources that are affordable, constant and accessible. Do wind and solar meet any of those requirements? No. Do fossil fuels meet those requirements? Yes. Does nuclear meet those requirements? Yes.It has been a long time since I did the reading but if I recall properly, the Price-Anderson Act has never cost US taxpayers a single penny. It is a Federal Government guarantee demanded by the insurance and finance sectors to limit their costs in case of a major nuclear plant disaster which has never happened. Calling it a subsidy is a convoluted though process although I suppose, if the extremely unlikely ever did happen, it might involve some taxpayer costs, depending on which way the politicians jumped.Nuclear waste storage is a red herring in any rational world. Again, based of earlier reading, the type of reactor normally built in the US, perhaps all of US reactors, use less than 1% of the energy in the fuel rods. According to theory, there are design that can use about 99%, producing very little waste.The leftover stuff could be very valuable in itself for other uses with some processing but I dont know if the processing costs for most of that would be economicalThere are physical difficulties with the design of such reactors, such as materials that can stand up to corrosion well enough to make the designs viable, but the potential is there if there could be enough interest to do the necessary material research (perfect first, build reactors after).Also, some other countries are not hobbled with the same stupidity as US regulations. They reprocess the used fuel, considerably reducing the waste to begin with. As above, this waste can be valuable in itself as a source of radioactive materials that have uses in industry and medicine, as well as for atomic batteries in locations needing moderate power for long periods without human intervention or maintenance.

The European Investment Bank (EIB) dealt a major blow to the nuclear industry at last weeks International Nuclear Energy Summit in Brussels, when it dithered over the industrys request for more funding for nuclear projects, but confirmed that investment in renewable energy will remain a priority until 2030.What would it take for nuclear energy to make a substantial contribution to our climate neutrality target? I see a number of key challenges. The most important is to secure new investment, said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at the Nuclear Energy Summit (NES) in Brussels on Thursday (21 March).This statement set the scene for the major international conference, where some 40 official delegations attended, including those from China, India, and the United States, along with more than 300 industry leaders. All of whom had come to request more certainty on financing for nuclear power.We call for greater integration of nuclear energy into the environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies of the international financial system, they wrote in a joint statement adopted at the event.But some are politically hesitant, not necessarily in favour of nuclear energy, said the French presidents office, before the summit, particularly the European Investment Bank (EIB). Who did not hesitate to repeat their hesitancy during the event leaving many guests speechless.By comparison, the EIB has lent more than 10 billion for renewable energy investments in 2021 alone  a trend is set to continue as renewable energy will be our priority until 2030, said EIB Vice-President Thomas stros at last weeks summit.Faudon also described stross speech as worrying, though, she acknowledged that some progress had been made in this area, as not so long ago, everyone in Brussels thought it was perfectly normal to say that we only deal with renewables, she told Euractiv.In the past, potential developers were discouraged, so to speak, from applying [for EIB funding], said Yves Desbazeilles, director general of Nucleareurope, the association representing the nuclear industry to the EU.This was the case, for example, with the financing of the Hinkley Point C nuclear reactors in England, he told Euractiv at a press briefing on Friday (22 March). According to Desbazeilles, the problem was that It seemed cumbersome and politically difficult.Frances EDF has recently come under fire for increasing project costs and delays, while problems with its existing fleet of reactors have resurfaced. Euractiv looks at what this means for the state-owned energy giant as the industry appears to be in full swing.At the same time, the European Commission, responsible for providing an opinion on any EIB financing, seems more inclined than before to welcome a nuclear project, especially Small Modular Reactors (SMRs).Pressure on the EIBs management is mounting after the French-led Nuclear Alliances call in early March, to open up European financing for nuclear power.This was reiterated, by 12 EU countries on the sidelines of the Nuclear Energy Summit on Thursday.As EIB investment decisions require the approval of all EU member states, the only thing left to do is to urge member states that are strongly opposed to nuclear power, such as Germany and Austria, to change their mindset, Andrei Goicea, head of public policy at Nucleareurope, told Euractiv on Friday.Nuclear technologies should benefit from all types of EU funding, such as the European Investment Bank (EIB) and innovation funds, the French-led nuclear alliance, which now has 12 EU member states, said at its meeting on Monday.
John Gorton, who was prime minister from 1968 to 1971, was a true believer in nuclear. His biographer Ian Hancock wrote that Gorton "visualised the generation of cheap electricity, and fuel for transport of all kinds"."We shall, during the next parliament, take Australia into the atomic age by beginning the construction of an atomic plant at Jervis Bay [on the NSW south coast], to generate electricity. We believe that Australia will make increasing use of atomic power in the years ahead and that the time for this nation to enter the atomic age has now arrived."Plans were well underway when in 1971 Gorton lost the prime ministership to Billy McMahon, a critic of the Jervis Bay project, which was put into limbo. Treasury did an evaluation that  you've guessed it  slammed the cost; a journalist at the time described it as "a most devastating critique". The way was opened for coal, which was much more economically viable for Australia's power generation. The Jervis Bay project was dead.Peter Dutton is a very different brand of Liberal from the freewheeling, often undisciplined Gorton, but he has become as convinced as his predecessor about the nuclear path. And, just as in Gorton's time, the critics cite cost. Only now the cost issue is about renewables versus nuclear.It seems an odd choice as the year's first big policy hit  nuclear power isn't dominating kitchen table discussions around the country. Leaving that aside, the release will be a major test for Dutton, in handling both the economics and the politics of the ensuing debate.He starts with most energy experts ranged against him. He's obviously not himself an expert, so being convincing when he has to get into the fine detail won't be easy. Public attitudes towards nuclear may have softened, but if he flounders in defending the economic case, he'll have lost the argument even before the politics kick in.One aspect of the evolution of the opposition's nuclear policy that raises an eyebrow is how it has so quickly transitioned from concentrating on small modular reactors  which spokesman Ted O'Brien spruiked enthusiastically but most experts dismissed as impractical  to being centred on conventional reactors. It might have been a sensible move, but it makes you wonder whether the policy crafters were on top of the complexities to start with.The opposition hopes its plan to place the reactors (about half a dozen) only on or near the sites of coal-fired power stations as they phase out will limit the effectiveness of Labor's scare assault. It will then become a matter of persuading the affected local communities, and Dutton has flagged incentives.More generally, the opposition aims to persuade regional voters that nuclear is better than having their areas covered with power lines and wind farms that many find ugly and intrusive. This would probably resonate in many areas, provided Dutton could allay other doubts with these voters, such as about cost.The cities will be another matter. In teal and similar seats, a strong commitment to renewables is likely to make voters unsympathetic to the nuclear case. The opposition may not have great hopes of winning back the teal electorates, but it will be aware of the risk of losing more seats to teal candidates and so it has to be careful.In outer suburbia, Dutton's target territory, the danger for him is that voters see nuclear power as a side issue. Yes, they will hear his claim it would mean lower power prices but, even if they buy that very contested argument, they'll know that would be far into the future.Hard-pressed families are interested in the here and now. And that goes to a broader problem for Dutton's nuclear campaign. It could lead up a dry gully, a debate that consumes time and effort better spent on more central cost-of-living and other issues.Dutton says the opposition won't be a small target at the election. Even if that's sound thinking, he needs to have reasonable confidence that "big target" policies will carry a more than 50-50 chance of paying significant dividends. He doesn't have much political capital to spend. The likely dividend from the nuclear policy could easily be a net negative.The energy minister has rubbished his shadow counterpart's claims Australia could have nuclear power plants up and running in 10 years as the Coalition prepares to announce the nuclear plan it will take to the next election.Dutton might be a nuclear believer but his stand also has to be understood in a Coalition context. His most important priority since the election has been keeping unity in the opposition's ranks. He has managed this but it is always potentially precarious.The Nationals have been bugbears for Liberal leaders on energy policy. Currently the party is divided between those who support the 2050 net zero emissions target (including leader David Littleproud) and the radical outliers who'd like to ditch the commitment to the target, which the party only signed up to under duress in the run-up to the last election.

The Biden administration and dozens of other countries have pledged to triple the capacity of nuclear power worldwide in their battle against climate change, ensuring uranium will remain a key commodity for decades as the government offers incentives for developing the next generation of nuclear reactors and new policies take aim at Russia's influence over the supply chain.But as the U.S. pursues its nuclear power potential, environmentalists and Native American leaders remain fearful of the consequences for communities near mining and milling sites in the West and are demanding better regulatory oversight.Producers say uranium production today is different than decades ago when the country was racing to build up its nuclear arsenal. Those efforts during World War II and the Cold War left a legacy of death, disease and contamination on the Navajo Nation and in other communities across the country, making any new development of the ore a hard pill to swallow for many.The new mining at Pinyon Plain Mine near the Grand Canyon's South Rim entrance is happening within the boundaries of the Baaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukv National Monument that was designated in August by President Joe Biden. The work was allowed to move forward since Energy Fuels Inc. had valid existing rights.The mine will cover only 17 acres (6.8 hectares) and will operate for three to six years, producing at least 2 million pounds (about 907,000 kilograms) of uranium  enough to power the state of Arizona for at least a year with carbon-free electricity, he said.Energy Fuels, which also is prepping two more mines in Colorado and Wyoming, has produced about two-thirds of the uranium in the U.S. in the last five years. In 2022, it was awarded a contract to sell $18.5 million in uranium concentrates to the U.S. government to help establish the nation's strategic reserve for when supplies might be disrupted.Amid the growing appetite for uranium, a coalition of Native Americans testified before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in late February, asking the panel to pressure the U.S. government to overhaul outdated mining laws and prevent further exploitation of marginalized communities.Carletta Tilousi, who served for years on the Havasupai Tribal Council, said she and others have written countless letters to state and federal agencies and sat through hours of meetings with regulators and lawmakers. Her tribe's reservation lies in a gorge off the Grand Canyon.A group of hydrology and geology professors and nuclear watchdogs sent Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs a letter in January, asking she reconsider permits granted by state environmental regulators that cleared the way for the mine. She has yet to respond and her office declined to answer questions from The Associated Press.Lawyers for Energy Fuels said in a letter to state officials that reopening the permits would be an improper attempt to side step Arizona's administrative procedures and rights protecting permit holders from ''such politicized actions.''The environmentalists' request followed a plea weeks earlier by the Havasupai saying mining at the foot of Red Butte will compromise one of the tribe's most sacred spots. Called Wii'i Gdwiisa by the Havasupai, the landmark is central to tribal creation stories and also holds significance for the Hopi, Navajo and Zuni people.''It is with heavy hearts that we must acknowledge that our greatest fear has come true,'' the Havasupai said in a January statement, reflecting on concerns that mining could affect water supplies, wildlife, plants and geology throughout the Colorado Plateau.The U.S. Geological Survey recently partnered with the Havasupai Tribe to examine contamination possibilities that could include exposure through inhalation and ingestion of traditional food and medicines, processing animal hides or absorption through materials collected for face and body painting.Legal challenges aimed at stopping the Pinyon Plain Mine repeatedly have been rejected by the courts, and top officials in the Biden administration are reticent to weigh in beyond speaking generally about efforts to improve consultation with Native American tribes.It marks another front in an ongoing battle over energy development and sacred lands, as tribes in Nevada and Arizona are fighting the federal government over the mining of lithium and the siting of renewable energy transmission lines.The Pinyon Plain Mine, formerly known as the Canyon Mine, was permitted in 1984. Because it retained existing rights, the mine effectively became grandfathered into legal operation despite a 20-year moratorium placed on uranium mining in the Grand Canyon region by the Obama administration in 2012.The U.S. Forest Service in 2012 reaffirmed an environmental impact statement that had been prepared for the mine years earlier, and state regulators signed off on air and aquifer protection permitting within the past two years.Environmental reviews conducted as part of the permitting process have concluded the mine's operation won't affect visitors to the national park, area residents or groundwater or springs associated with the park. Still, environmentalists say the mine raises a bigger question about the Biden administration's willingness to adopt policies favorable of nuclear power.The U.S. Commerce Department under the Trump administration issued a 2019 report describing domestic production as essential to national security, citing the need to maintain the nuclear arsenal and keep commercial nuclear reactors fueled to generate electricity. At that point, nuclear reactors supplied nearly 20% of the electricity consumed in the U.S.The Biden administration is staying the course. It's in the midst of a multibillion-dollar modernization of the nation's nuclear defense capabilities, and the U.S. Energy Department on Wednesday offered a $1.5 billion loan to the owners of a Michigan power plant to restart the shuttered facility, which would mark a first in the U.S.Taylor McKinnon, the Center for Biological Diversity's Southwest director, said pushing for more nuclear power and allowing mining near the Grand Canyon ''makes a mockery of the administration's environmental justice rhetoric."Using nuclear power to reach emissions goals is a hard sell in the western U.S. From the Navajo Nation to Ute Mountain Ute and Oglala Lakota homelands, tribal communities have deep-seated distrust of uranium companies and the federal government as abandoned mines and related contamination have yet to be cleaned up.A complex of mines on the Navajo Nation recently was added to the federal Superfund list. The eastern edge of the reservation also is home to the largest radioactive accident in U.S. history. In 1979, more than 93 million gallons (350 million liters) of radioactive and acidic slurry spilled from a tailings disposal pond, contaminating water supplies, livestock and downstream communities. It was three times the radiation released at the Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania just three months earlier.Teracita Keyanna with the Red Water Pond Road Community Association got choked up while testifying before the human rights commission in Washington, D.C., saying federal regulators proposed keeping contaminated soil onsite rather than removing it.''It's really unfair that we have to deal with this and my children have to deal with this and later on, my grandchildren have to deal with this,'' she said. ''Why is the government just feeling like we're disposable. We're not.''Congresswoman Cori Bush of Missouri said during a congressional meeting in January that lawmakers can't talk about expanding nuclear energy in the U.S. without first dealing with the effects that nuclear waste has had on minority communities. Bush pointed to her own district in St. Louis, where waste was left behind from the uranium refining required by the top-secret Manhattan Project.
The Coalitions solution to the climate crisis is set to be unveiled, with Peter Dutton reportedly planning to announce sites for a number of nuclear power stations, which would necessarily involve lifting Australias long-standing ban on nuclear power.While the Coalitions policy has been rubbished as misinformed bulldust by the likes of Andrew Forrest, a dumb idea by experts and hot air by the energy minister, the News Corp papers have been at the forefront of nuclear advocacy.In the past month, The Australian has published a number of articles on nuclear power, with only one of its many op-eds (the aforementioned hot air piece by Energy Minister Chris Bowen) arguing in favour of Australias ban on nuclear.Dutton is right to develop a net-zero plan that includes nuclear, the piece continued. Refusing to lift the ban or even consider the issue  makes the federal government look out of touch with what is happening in the modern energy world.Crikey asked The Australians managing editor Darren Davidson on March 5 whether the paper had an editorial view on the merits of nuclear energy, and how it balanced any view it may have with the Coalitions policy position, as well as any ethical obligations that may arise in its reportage. He declined to comment.This mornings editorial comes on the heels of one published on February 17 headlined Nuclear option made easy by the renewables miscue. It went on to describe nuclear power as a logical option for emissions-free power, a sensible option, but admitted it was incendiary politics.Political editor Simon Benson has been responsible for much of this nuclear coverage, penning an op-ed on February 25 that argued the Labor government was at risk of ending up on the wrong side of history in its fanatical opposition to nuclear power.Benson was also responsible for an exclusive, also published on February 25, that showed Newspoll data conducted for The Australian that showed 55% of Australian voters supported the idea of small modular nuclear reactors as a replacement technology for coal-fired power.The Australian has also ran a number of opinion pieces over the past month in favour of the Coalitions policy, including one by Peta Credlin headlined: Liberal true believers stand firm against false net-zero gospel.However the paper also ran a piece by Sarah Ison on February 16 that highlighted one of the limits of the introduction of nuclear power in Australia. Ison interviewed Australian Industry Group climate change director Tennant Reed, who said that Australia may be waiting for more than 20 years for economically viable nuclear power.Are you among the 55% of Australians who apparently support the idea of small modular nuclear reactors as a replacement for coal power?

Shortly after the magnitude-9 earthquake struck on March 11, a series of tsunamis inundated four of the reactor buildings and set off a chain reaction in three reactors that resulted in the release of significant amounts of radioactivity into the environment.The challenge in recent years has been to gather the large amounts of nuclear fuel that escaped from the reactors in order to halt the release of more radiation something that had never been attempted before and has to be carried out in buildings where radioactive contamination remains dangerously elevated and where debris from the tsunami and subsequent hydrogen explosions still litters the area.Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO), the operator of the plant, has estimated that work to make the plant safe will take between 30 and 40 years, but recent reports on progress at the site have been largely negative.In January, TEPCO announced that it would have to delay plans to commence in March the test use of a robotic arm to remove radioactive material from the No. 2 reactor. The initial plan called for tests using the robotic limb to take place in 2021 but were delayed by technical glitches.Other areas of the project have also experienced challenges, with the first drones and a robot sent into the No. 1 reactor building earlier this month also suffering faults. The drones and robothad to be withdrawn before they could complete their mission to locate molten fuel debris that has leaked from the reactor and to map other damage."Based on the roadmap and the Nuclear Regulation Authority's 'Risk Map,'the decommissioning steps to be taken over the next 10 years have been compiled in the mid-and-long term decommissioning action plan, which is periodically revised in light of decommissioning progress and the emergence of new issues that need to be addressed,"TEPCO said.The company is also keen to point out its achievements, including the complete removal of spent nuclear fuel from units three and four at the site, a sharp reduction in the amount of water seeping into the chambers beneath the reactors and becoming contaminated with radiation as well as the successful treatment of radioactive water below according to standards set by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) before it is released into the Pacific Ocean.Vincent Gorgues, the chief of staff to the French High Commissioner for Nuclear Energy and presently one of three international special advisors to Japan's Nuclear Damage Compensation and Decommissioning Facilitation Corp, told DW that progress to date has been overwhelmingly positive, despite the countless challenges."Nuclear projects are complex,"he said. "Among them, decommissioning projects are highly singular and offer a higher level of difficulty, due mainly to the level of uncertainty about the initial state of the facility and to difficulties in managing safely all the radioactive waste streams.""Even today, access to the reactor buildings is very difficult and requires fully remotely operated means of intervention, while carrying out investigations and having a precise idea of what needs to be done, even before considering how to do it, is a huge challenge in itself,"Gorgues said.In addition, each of the three crippled reactors has its own set of specific challenges and there is no disposal site for the highly radioactive nuclear waste that must be recovered from the site, he pointed out.The key steps now are to remove all the spent nuclear fuel, whether intact or leaked, from inside reactor buildings one and two, and the retrieval and disposal of fuel debris from the partial core meltdowns.Gorgues said he favors speeding up the release of treated water from the plant in order to dismantle the hundreds of storage tanks that presently occupy much of the site, with that land needed for new waste treatment and storage facilities.The expert also played down suggestions that TEPCO would likely not be able to stick to its declared timeline for the decommissioning process, emphasizing that the three- or four-decade schedule is "a target"rather than a deadline."This is not a race, but a structured, careful,stepwise approach, which at every stage requires you to take time, determine the best strategy and guarantee both short-term and long-term safety,"Gorgues said, adding that the radiological conditions "are extremely hostile.""This indicative timeframe of 30 to 40 years had two communication goals: to show that it would take a long time; but also to show that the timeframe would remain commensurable with one professional career and that the burden would not be passed on over several generations. It is in that spirit that we must consider this target.""I would like to stress, however, that these delays have remained minor and that most of what was announced has been achieved,"he said. "In my opinion, and under these conditions, what has already been done is a remarkable achievement."

To great grief, the man died on the spot from his wounds before the arrival of the ambulance crew," Gladkov said on Telegram, adding that a second person, a woman, was killed and two were wounded in Chernyansky district.In the Samara region, hundreds of kilometers from the Ukrainian border, the Kuibyshev and Novokuibyshev oil refineries were attacked by drones early on March 23, said the governor of the region, Dmitry Azarov.Ukraine has continued its monthslong campaign of using drones to target Russian oil and other infrastructure. The effort has partially disrupted Russian gasoline supplies, and driven domestic prices higher.Fears that disrupted Russian oil prices could ripple through global markets prompted U.S. officials to quietly urge Ukraine to halt attacks on Russias energy infrastructure, the Financial Times reported March 22.A Russian court on April 3 rejected an appeal filed by a 17-year-old against a six-year prison term he was handed in November for throwing Molotov cocktails at recruitment centers in St. Petersburg and Kirovsk to protest Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Yegor Balazeikin was arrested in February 2023. He said at the time that his actions were strongly influenced by the death of his uncle, who was killed after volunteering to fight in Ukraine. Balazeikin has an autoimmune disease and is legally recognized as disabled.

The airline said on April 3 that the suspension of flights to and from Kazan would come into effect on April 5 and that it was being done "for security reasons." The announcement came a day after a drone attack targeted Tatarstan's industrial facilities in Yelabuga and Nizhnekamsk, injuring 14 people, including foreigners from eight nations, in what appeared to be the deepest such strike inside Russia by Ukrainian armed forces fighting against Russia's ongoing invasion launched in February 2022. Kyiv has not officially claimed responsibility for the attack.Ukraine's fifth president, Petro Poroshenko, told Al-Jazeera television on April 2 that he plans to run for president again after Russia's ongoing invasion of his country is over. Poroshenko also said that, if Ukraine becomes an EU member, he is ready to run for the European Parliament. The presidential election in Ukraine scheduled for March 2024 was postponed indefinitely because of Russia's aggression against its neighbor. Poroshenko served as Ukraine's president in 2014-2019. He lost in a runoff to incumbent Volodymyr Zelenskiy in 2019.

The legislation also introduces wide oversight powers by the authorities and potential criminal sanctions for undefined criminal offences.They warned Japarov that, if the measure comes into force, organizations involved in assisting Kyrgyz citizens with obtaining medical equipment and medicine to treat numerous diseases, including cancer and HIV, as well as groups involved in educational programs, human rights, and anti-corruption activities, may have to stop their operations.Since the law was first introduced last year, civil society activists have warned of the consequences of approving such legislation, especially given that similar legislation in Russia laid the groundwork for the systematic dismantling of civil society.The vague laws have been used to persecute organizations working in diverse fields such as education, culture, health care, environmental protection, human-rights defense, and especially independent media.Once called an "island of democracy" in the region, Kyrgyzstan stood out in Central Asia for many years thanks to the independent journalism, intrepid reporting, and media innovation that existed in the country. However, in Reporters Without Borders' most recent global ranking, Kyrgyzstan fell 50 places, sitting in 122nd place -- only 12 spots above its longtime authoritarian neighbor Kazakhstan.Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said his country's support for Ukraine was unwavering during a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on April 3, the Foreign Ministry in Tokyo said. "Prime Minister Kishida said he would like to express heartfelt respect for the courage of President Zelenskiy and the people of Ukraine, and that Japan will not waver in its position of standing together with Ukraine," the ministry said in a statement. Zelenskiy said in a post on X that he briefed Kishida on the battlefield situation and emphasized the need to step up sanction pressure on Russia and create a mechanism for confiscating frozen Russian assets.The Vyasna human rights center in Belarus said on April 3 that the Minsk regional court sentenced a 57-year-old man to six years in prison for sending money to two opposition groups. Alyaksandr Verasovich was found guilty of financially supporting "extremist" groups by sending money via the PayPal system to the BySol fund that assists repressed Belarusian activists and journalists and the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment, consisting of Belarusian citizens who have been fighting alongside Ukrainian forces against occupying Russian troops.

Chernyshov, who was arrested in May 2023, is accused of attempting to transfer Memorial's archives to Germany. Chernyshov's co-defendant, Robert Latypov, is outside of Russia and will be tried separately, in absentia. The authorities ordered Memorial's archives to be transferred to Moscow after the group was liquidated in February 2022.

Last week, another former Soviet republic, Armenia, announced a similar move. In September 2022, the U.S. Treasury Department threatened foreign banks with secondary sanctions for servicing Mir cards, a Russian card-payment system. Earlier, some banks in Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam, as well as Samsung Pay and Apple Pay systems, stopped working with Mir cards.Russian opposition activist and Soviet-era dissident Aleksandr Skobov was arrested late on April 2 in Russia's second-largest city, St. Petersburg, on a charge of promoting terrorism, his associates said. Last month, the 66-year-old was added to Russia's "foreign agents" registry. Skobov's detention came two days after he gave an interview to the Okno website where he called for support of Russian volunteer groups fighting along with Ukraine's military against Russian troops that have invaded Ukraine. He also condemned Russia's ongoing aggression against its neighbor.

Trump has been critical of additional aid to Ukraine and of NATO.The Ramstein Format was created by U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin shortly after the February 2022 full-scale invasion and has been credited with facilitating tens of billions of dollars in critical military and other aid to Ukraine.The previous day, Kuleba was in The Hague for an international conference titled Restoring Justice For Ukraine. Kuleba announced the opening of an online Register of Damages, urging Ukrainians to request compensation for damages or destruction of residential property incurred during Russias full-scale invasion since February 2022.In a concluding statement at the Restoring Justice For Ukraine conference, representatives of 44 countries condemned acts of aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine and confirmed their commitment to the creation of a special tribunal for the investigation and prosecution of the crime of aggression against Ukraine.Georgia's ruling party, Georgian Dream, says it will reintroduce a controversial "foreign agent" bill that was pulled last year amid massive protests over fears the legislation, which mirrored a similar law in Russia, would severely restrict dissent and the activity of civil society groups in the country and push it toward authoritarianism."Instead of using the phrase 'agent of foreign influence,' the phrase 'organization carrying the interests of a foreign power' will be used. All other parts of the draft law are unchanged," Mdinaradze said.In March 2023, parliament began readings to approve the draft, but it abruptly halted the process after Georgian Dream announced it was withdrawing the proposed legislation in the face of the protests.Tens of thousands of protesters who had taken to the streets of the Georgian capital over the legislation were met by heavily armed police that used tear gas, stun grenades, and water cannons to break up the demonstration. Dozens of people were detained.Parliament took up the "foreign agents" legislation despite warnings from critics that the bill, which would force civil society organizations that receive more than 20 percent of their funding from abroad to be classified as "foreign agents," mirrors Russian legislation that has been used to stifle opposition voices and the independent media.In Georgia, anti-Russian sentiment can often be strong. Russian troops still control around one-fifth of Georgia's territory, most of it taken during a lightning war in 2008 that was ostensibly about breakaway efforts in two northeastern regions, Abkhazia and South Ossetia.While Georgian Dream deescalated the crisis by withdrawing the legislation, tensions persist over the ruling party and its opponents' competing visions for the heavily polarized Caucasus country and its nearly 5 million residents.The opposition has often criticized Georgian Dream for being too closely aligned with Moscow and the Kremlin's current war against another former Soviet republic, Ukraine, has heightened those concerns.Georgia has been moving toward joining the European Union but EU officials said the "foreign agent" law would complicate that membership path. Last year, the bloc declined to grant candidate status to Georgia, citing stalled political and judicial reforms.A U.S. intelligence warning to Moscow two weeks ahead of a deadly March 22 terrorist attack included specific reference to the Crocus City Hall concert venue that was targeted, The Washington Post reported on April 2.According to the report, which was later confirmed by The New York Times, U.S. officials told Moscow that the Islamic State extremist group was plotting an attack and that Crocus City Hall was a potential target.However, three days before the attack, Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to acknowledge receiving the warnings, though he dismissed them as "provocative statements" by the West that were meant to "resemble outright blackmail and the intention to intimidate and destabilize our society."Four gunmen stormed the concert hall outside of Moscow just before a concert, killing 144 people in the deadliest terrorist attack in Russia since 2004. The Islamic State, a designated terrorist group, quickly claimed responsibility for the attack.Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials and commentators have claimed without evidence that Ukraine might have played a role in the attack. Ukrainian officials have denied any involvement and have accused Moscow of using the tragedy to ramp up its war against their country.The Crocus attack was a major failure for Russia's security forces, which critics say are focused on stifling domestic political dissent and opposition to the war against Ukraine, often prosecuting political opinions as "terrorism" or "extremism."Police in London say a March 29 stabbing of an Iranian journalist is being investigated by the Counter Terrorism Command, although investigators have not established a motive. A police statement on April 2 said the authorities believe three suspects were involved in the attack, in which self-exiled Persian-language journalist Pouria Zeraati suffered an injury to his leg. The three men abandoned their vehicle shortly after the incident and left the country by air within hours, police said. Zeraati works for Iran International television, which has been critical of Iran's government.An accidental oil leakage during production, discharge of industrial water containing petroleum products, or a possible emergency situation with service vessels are among the potential causes of a leak.But the North Caspian Operating Company (NCOC), a consortium largely owned by the Western oil companies that operate the offshore field, said the satellite images showed a different, natural phenomenon, and subsequent images of the same location showed nothing unusual.The NCOC on March 29 held public hearings on its work in the marine complex. Company managers said then that the company did not allow pollution of the air or the sea and referred to reports and presentations of NCOC specialists and project developers in which they said the company was striving for zero emissions in the local environment.Questions were also addressed to the Ecology Department of the Atyrau region about what measures had been taken to deal with the alleged spill and whether damage to the marine environment and biodiversity had been determined."If these facts are confirmed, the Department of Ecology for the Atyrau region will conduct an unscheduled inspection of the NCOC company. The results will be reported," the department said in a statement.The United States had no involvement in an air strike on Iran's consular annex building in the Syrian capital, Damascus, that Tehran blamed on Israel, the White House said on April 2. "We had nothing to do with the strike in Damascus. We weren't involved in any way whatsoever," National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told a briefing. Kirby dismissed as "nonsense" comments by Iran's foreign minister that the United States, Israel's main backer, bore responsibility for the attack, which killed seven members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.Authorities in Belarus have arrested a well-known activist on charges punishable by up to four years in prison, the Vyasna human rights group said on April 2. Dzmitry Kuchuk, whose Green Party was shut down last year, has been charged with organizing activities that grossly violate public order, according to Vyasna. The center said Kuchuk, 50, was arrested on February 16 in Minsk when he attempted to lay flowers and light a candle in memory of Russian opposition politician Aleksei Navalny, whose death was announced that day. Authorities ordered Kuchuk jailed for two 15-day periods before filing charges against him.NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has proposed creating a 100 billion-euro ($108 illion), five-year fund for Ukraine in a push to get the alliance more involved in sending weapons to Kyiv. NATO foreign ministers will hold preliminary talks on the plan in Brussels on April 3 as they seek to forge a support package for Ukraine by a July summit in Washington. "Foreign ministers will discuss the best way to organize NATO's support for Ukraine, to make it more powerful, predictable, and enduring," a NATO official said on April 2.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on April 2 signed into law a bill lowering the mobilization age from 27 to 25, the website of the Ukrainian parliament -- the Verkhovna Rada -- said. The bill was approved by lawmakers in May 2023. Media reports said earlier that Zelenskiy hesitated to sign the bill, saying that he needed to see a detailed plan by the military on how new recruits would be deployed to replace those who have been on the battlefield since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.The residents held a rally on April 1 on the heels of the announcement of the project by Tehran's municipality, with the mayor's office advocating for the construction of mosques in public spaces. Police maintained a significant presence at the protest site, though no disturbances were reported.The campaign, particularly for the mayor's proposal for a mosque in Qeytarieh Park, has drawn criticism for coming at a time when the city's financial resources could be better allocated toward supporting the underprivileged rather than constructing new religious structures.An official from the Cultural Heritage Department of Tehran Province announced that fences installed by the municipality around the site where the mosque is to be built had been dismantled, though the news has not been confirmed.The construction plan has drawn further scrutiny amid revelations last year by Mohammad Abolghassem Doulabi, a senior Iranian cleric, that 50,000 out of 75,000 mosques across the country had closed due to dwindling attendance.A lawyer for several survivors and relatives of victims of the terrorist attack at the Crocus City Hall entertainment center near Moscow said many have filed lawsuits against the venue's owners, accusing them of fire safety violations.On the night of the attack, the stage curtain -- supposedly made of fireproof material -- caught fire in seconds, the doors of many evacuation exits were locked, and the smoke removal system in the hall did not work, increasing the number of victims, according to lawyer Igor Trunov, who was quoted by RIA Novosti on April 2.Aras Agalarov, who has roots in Azerbaijan, said earlier that the fire safety system in the entertainment center was working properly when several men in military uniform rushed into the Crocus City Hall and started shooting minutes before a concert by the rock group Piknik on March 22.The Islamic State extremist group claimed responsibility for the attack, while Russian officials have said that Ukraine and Western countries were involved but have provided no evidence to support the claim.The U.S. Embassy in Moscow has slammed a Russian court ruling to extend the pretrial detention of RFE/RL journalist Alsu Kurmasheva until June 5, calling the countrys crackdown on independent media unacceptable.Kurmasheva, a Prague-based journalist with RFE/RL who holds dual U.S. and Russian citizenship, has been held in Russian custody since October 18 on a charge of violating the so-called "foreign agent" law.RFE/RL and the U.S. government say the charge is a reprisal for her work as journalist for RFE/RL. She had traveled to Russia to visit and care for her elderly mother and was initially detained while waiting for her return flight on June 2 at Kazan airport, where her passports were confiscated.We are deeply concerned about the detention of Alsu Kurmasheva in the Russian Federation, which the court extended, Ambassador Lynne Tracy said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, on April 2, adding that representatives from the embassy were present in court in Kazan.Before the court proceedings, Kurmasheva told reporters that she is "not very well physically" and that her living conditions in detention "are very bad. She added that she was receiving "minimal" medical care and that conditions in her cell were primitive, with a hole in the floor serving as a toilet.Kurmasheva, 47, was arrested in Kazan last October and charged with failing to register as a "foreign agent" under a punitive Russian law that targets journalists, civil society activists, and others. Shes also been charged with spreading falsehoods about the Russian military and faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.The prize, created in 1997, is an annual award that honors a person or a group of people who make an "outstanding" contribution to the defense and promotion of press freedom across the globe despite the "danger and persecution" they face.Kurmasheva is one of four RFE/RL journalists -- Andrey Kuznechyk, Ihar Losik, and Vladyslav Yesypenko are the other three -- currently imprisoned on charges related to their work. Rights groups and RFE/RL have called repeatedly for the release of all four, saying they have been wrongly detained.Losik is a blogger and contributor for RFE/RLs Belarus Service who was convicted in December 2021 on several charges including the organization and preparation of actions that grossly violate public order and sentenced to 15 years in prison.Kuznechyk, a web editor for RFE/RLs Belarus Service, was sentenced in June 2022 to six years in prison following a trial that lasted no more than a few hours. He was convicted of creating or participating in an extremist organization.Yesypenko, a dual Ukrainian-Russian citizen who contributed to Crimea.Realities, a regional news outlet of RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service, was sentenced in February 2022 to six years in prison by a Russian judge in occupied Crimea after a closed-door trial. He was convicted of possession and transport of explosives, a charge he steadfastly denies.Police in Russia's Komi Republic detained activist Dmitry Makhov on April 2 for using a picture of the historical flag of Belarus online. Makhov was charged with displaying an extremist symbol on a social network. The white-red-white flag was used by the short-lived Belarusian Democratic Republic in 1918-1920 and reinstated after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. In 1995, the authoritarian ruler of Belarus, Alyaksandr Lukashenka, replaced the historical flag with one similar to that used in the Soviet era. Opposition groups have used the historical flag as their symbol for decades.

"It is absolutely essential to get Ukrainians what they continue to need to defend themselves, particularly when it comes to munitions and air defenses," Blinken told reporters during a visit to France. "It's another reason why the supplementary budget request that President [Joe] Biden has made to [the U.S.] Congress must be fulfilled as quickly as possible."Tehran has vowed revenge after several people, including a senior commander of Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), were killed in an air strike on the Iranian Consulate in Damascus over the weekend that has been attributed to Israel.Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on April 2 that Israel will be made to "regret" the strike at the Iranian Embassy compound in Damascus, which killed Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior commander of the IRGC's Quds Force, and six others believed to be IRGC members.Israel has not said it carried out the attack, though it has ramped up its campaign of air strikes on targets associated with Iran since a war against Hamas, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union, broke out in the Gaza Strip in October. Hamas is supported by Tehran.Military sources said Israeli missiles were fired from the occupied Golan Heights and that the Syrian air defense system intercepted a number of them, though some hit their target, leading to the "total destruction of the building" and the killing and wounding of "everyone inside."Israel -- as per its usual policy -- has not commented on the strike, but the Reuters news agency quoted a senior Israeli government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, as saying those hit had "been behind many attacks on Israeli and American assets and had plans for additional attacks."The White House said it was aware of the reports. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said at a daily news briefing that Washington was "concerned about anything that would be escalatory or cause an increase in conflict in the region."Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian told his Syrian counterpart, Faisal Mekdad, in a phone call that his government holds Israel responsible for the attack and labeled it a breach of all international conventions," according to Iranian state TV.Ali Shamkhani, a political adviser to Khamenei, said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that the United States "remains directly responsible whether or not it was aware of the intention to carry out this attack."If you are in Russia or the Russia-controlled parts of Ukraine and hold a Russian passport or are a stateless person residing permanently in Russia or the Russia-controlled parts of Ukraine, please note that you could face fines or imprisonment for sharing, liking, commenting on, or saving our content, or for contacting us.
Rescuers pulled more bodies from the rubble of a Moscow-area concert venue on March 23 as the toll from a deadly attack claimed by the Islamic State (IS) militant group reached 133 and security officials said four suspected gunmen had been detained in connection with Russias worst terrorist violence in nearly two decades.President Vladimir Putin condemned it as a bloody, barbaric terrorist attack and said in a recorded video address released by the Kremlin that the main thing now is to prevent those who are behind this bloodbath from committing a new crime."The day after camouflaged gunmen burst into the Crocus City Hall and opened fire on people waiting for a concert to begin, searchers were still looking for victims in the wreckage of the hall. More than 120 people were wounded and remained hospitalized in various conditions, health officials said.The Emergency Situations Ministry published the names of 29 of the 133 people known so far to have died, and Moscow region Governor Andrei Vorobyov has warned the death toll could still rise "significantly."More makeshift memorials to honor the victims sprang up in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, and many other Russian cities, including flowers, candles, and messages to the families of victims. Flags flew at half-mast above government buildings in some places.At the hollowed-out site of one of the deadliest acts of terror in modern Russian history, School No. 1 in Beslan, in southern Russia, where 333 people including mostly schoolchildren were killed after being taken hostage for three days in 2004, Russians spelled out  "Moscow we mourn" with candles.The chairman of the constitutional law committee in Russia's upper house, Andrei Klishas, spurred more such talk on Telegram by saying that neither chamber of parliament can "overcome decisions of the Constitutional Court."The death penalty remains in the Russian Constitution but has been under an indefinite moratorium for nearly three decades, including since the Constitutional Court in 2009 effectively banned lower courts from ordering executions.In his recorded address, Putin also echoed earlier suggestions by other Russian officials of Ukrainian involvement, saying the four suspected gunmen "tried to hide and were moving toward Ukraine, where, according to preliminary information, the Ukrainian side had prepared a window for them to cross the border."Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Putin of trying to "blame someone else." Alluding to previous violent incidents in Russia, he said, "It already happened. And there were blown up houses, and shootings, and explosions. And they always blame others."The deaths were caused by either gunshot wounds or asphyxiation apparently from burning materials, said the Investigative Committee, adding that the toll was likely climb. Attackers used an unspecified flammable substance to set fire to the venue the committee said.The Russian Investigative Committee said it was awarding one man for "unparalleled courage" when he "selflessly neutralized one of the terrorists" while trying to protect his wife, "saving the lives of the people around him." It did not further identify the man.The identities and motives of the attackers remained unclear. Aleksandr Bortnikov, the director of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying 11 people had been detained, including four of the suspected gunmen.Unnamed officials and Telegram channels known for links to security services suggested that several of the attackers may have been Tajik, or Russian citizens with Tajik background. The reports prompted pushback from Tajikistans Foreign Ministry, which denied the reports and published detailed information on several of the men whose names were circulating.Russia's state broadcaster Channel One TV showed footage of the questioning of four men it said were suspects and a white Renault automobile that they were said to have used in their escape effort. The daylight video followed their capture in Khatsun, the station said.It was supposed to be starting when we heard something which I thought were fireworks or gunshots inside the venue, the eyewitness, identified only as Dave, said in a phone interview. The moment after, we saw beneath us a stream of people running inside the hall. After that, gunshots were already heard inside [the hall]. Of course, panic started on the balcony too. People didn't know where to run."On the same day as the U.S. Embassy announcement, the Federal Security Service claimed it had stopped an attack on a Moscow synagogue by Islamic State's affiliate in Afghanistan, known as Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K).U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed "our deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of those killed and all affected by this heinous crime" and said, "We condemn terrorism in all its forms and stand in solidarity with the people of Russia in grieving the loss of life from this horrific event."On March 23, German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser told the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper that "According to everything that is known so far, it can be assumed that the terrorist group Islamic State Khorasan Province (IS-K) is responsible for the murderous terrorist attack near Moscow."UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was quoted as saying that he "condemns in the strongest possible terms" the incident, and the United States, France, Turkey, Italy, the European Union, and other leaders also issued statements, deploring the violence.A Russian court on April 3 rejected an appeal filed by a 17-year-old against a six-year prison term he was handed in November for throwing Molotov cocktails at recruitment centers in St. Petersburg and Kirovsk to protest Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Yegor Balazeikin was arrested in February 2023. He said at the time that his actions were strongly influenced by the death of his uncle, who was killed after volunteering to fight in Ukraine. Balazeikin has an autoimmune disease and is legally recognized as disabled.

The airline said on April 3 that the suspension of flights to and from Kazan would come into effect on April 5 and that it was being done "for security reasons." The announcement came a day after a drone attack targeted Tatarstan's industrial facilities in Yelabuga and Nizhnekamsk, injuring 14 people, including foreigners from eight nations, in what appeared to be the deepest such strike inside Russia by Ukrainian armed forces fighting against Russia's ongoing invasion launched in February 2022. Kyiv has not officially claimed responsibility for the attack.Ukraine's fifth president, Petro Poroshenko, told Al-Jazeera television on April 2 that he plans to run for president again after Russia's ongoing invasion of his country is over. Poroshenko also said that, if Ukraine becomes an EU member, he is ready to run for the European Parliament. The presidential election in Ukraine scheduled for March 2024 was postponed indefinitely because of Russia's aggression against its neighbor. Poroshenko served as Ukraine's president in 2014-2019. He lost in a runoff to incumbent Volodymyr Zelenskiy in 2019.

The legislation also introduces wide oversight powers by the authorities and potential criminal sanctions for undefined criminal offences.They warned Japarov that, if the measure comes into force, organizations involved in assisting Kyrgyz citizens with obtaining medical equipment and medicine to treat numerous diseases, including cancer and HIV, as well as groups involved in educational programs, human rights, and anti-corruption activities, may have to stop their operations.Since the law was first introduced last year, civil society activists have warned of the consequences of approving such legislation, especially given that similar legislation in Russia laid the groundwork for the systematic dismantling of civil society.The vague laws have been used to persecute organizations working in diverse fields such as education, culture, health care, environmental protection, human-rights defense, and especially independent media.Once called an "island of democracy" in the region, Kyrgyzstan stood out in Central Asia for many years thanks to the independent journalism, intrepid reporting, and media innovation that existed in the country. However, in Reporters Without Borders' most recent global ranking, Kyrgyzstan fell 50 places, sitting in 122nd place -- only 12 spots above its longtime authoritarian neighbor Kazakhstan.Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said his country's support for Ukraine was unwavering during a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on April 3, the Foreign Ministry in Tokyo said. "Prime Minister Kishida said he would like to express heartfelt respect for the courage of President Zelenskiy and the people of Ukraine, and that Japan will not waver in its position of standing together with Ukraine," the ministry said in a statement. Zelenskiy said in a post on X that he briefed Kishida on the battlefield situation and emphasized the need to step up sanction pressure on Russia and create a mechanism for confiscating frozen Russian assets.The Vyasna human rights center in Belarus said on April 3 that the Minsk regional court sentenced a 57-year-old man to six years in prison for sending money to two opposition groups. Alyaksandr Verasovich was found guilty of financially supporting "extremist" groups by sending money via the PayPal system to the BySol fund that assists repressed Belarusian activists and journalists and the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment, consisting of Belarusian citizens who have been fighting alongside Ukrainian forces against occupying Russian troops.

Chernyshov, who was arrested in May 2023, is accused of attempting to transfer Memorial's archives to Germany. Chernyshov's co-defendant, Robert Latypov, is outside of Russia and will be tried separately, in absentia. The authorities ordered Memorial's archives to be transferred to Moscow after the group was liquidated in February 2022.

Last week, another former Soviet republic, Armenia, announced a similar move. In September 2022, the U.S. Treasury Department threatened foreign banks with secondary sanctions for servicing Mir cards, a Russian card-payment system. Earlier, some banks in Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam, as well as Samsung Pay and Apple Pay systems, stopped working with Mir cards.Russian opposition activist and Soviet-era dissident Aleksandr Skobov was arrested late on April 2 in Russia's second-largest city, St. Petersburg, on a charge of promoting terrorism, his associates said. Last month, the 66-year-old was added to Russia's "foreign agents" registry. Skobov's detention came two days after he gave an interview to the Okno website where he called for support of Russian volunteer groups fighting along with Ukraine's military against Russian troops that have invaded Ukraine. He also condemned Russia's ongoing aggression against its neighbor.

For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.We must ensure reliable and predictable security assistance to Ukraine for the long haul so that we rely less on voluntary contributions and more on NATO commitments, less on short-term offers and more on multi-year pledges, NATO Secretary Jens Stoltenberg said as the two-day meeting got under way.The U.S. news website Politico reported on April 2 that U.S. and Western officials were discussing moving the Ukraine Defense Contact Group -- also known as the Ramstein Format, under NATO auspices to maintain support for Ukraine if presumed Republican Party candidate Donald Trump wins the U.S. presidential election in November. Trump has been critical of additional aid to Ukraine and of NATO.The Ramstein Format was created by U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin shortly after the February 2022 full-scale invasion and has been credited with facilitating tens of billions of dollars in critical military and other aid to Ukraine.The previous day, Kuleba was in The Hague for an international conference titled Restoring Justice For Ukraine. Kuleba announced the opening of an online Register of Damages, urging Ukrainians to request compensation for damages or destruction of residential property incurred during Russias full-scale invasion since February 2022.In a concluding statement at the Restoring Justice For Ukraine conference, representatives of 44 countries condemned acts of aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine and confirmed their commitment to the creation of a special tribunal for the investigation and prosecution of the crime of aggression against Ukraine.Georgia's ruling party, Georgian Dream, says it will reintroduce a controversial "foreign agent" bill that was pulled last year amid massive protests over fears the legislation, which mirrored a similar law in Russia, would severely restrict dissent and the activity of civil society groups in the country and push it toward authoritarianism."Instead of using the phrase 'agent of foreign influence,' the phrase 'organization carrying the interests of a foreign power' will be used. All other parts of the draft law are unchanged," Mdinaradze said.In March 2023, parliament began readings to approve the draft, but it abruptly halted the process after Georgian Dream announced it was withdrawing the proposed legislation in the face of the protests.Tens of thousands of protesters who had taken to the streets of the Georgian capital over the legislation were met by heavily armed police that used tear gas, stun grenades, and water cannons to break up the demonstration. Dozens of people were detained.Parliament took up the "foreign agents" legislation despite warnings from critics that the bill, which would force civil society organizations that receive more than 20 percent of their funding from abroad to be classified as "foreign agents," mirrors Russian legislation that has been used to stifle opposition voices and the independent media.In Georgia, anti-Russian sentiment can often be strong. Russian troops still control around one-fifth of Georgia's territory, most of it taken during a lightning war in 2008 that was ostensibly about breakaway efforts in two northeastern regions, Abkhazia and South Ossetia.While Georgian Dream deescalated the crisis by withdrawing the legislation, tensions persist over the ruling party and its opponents' competing visions for the heavily polarized Caucasus country and its nearly 5 million residents.The opposition has often criticized Georgian Dream for being too closely aligned with Moscow and the Kremlin's current war against another former Soviet republic, Ukraine, has heightened those concerns.Georgia has been moving toward joining the European Union but EU officials said the "foreign agent" law would complicate that membership path. Last year, the bloc declined to grant candidate status to Georgia, citing stalled political and judicial reforms.A U.S. intelligence warning to Moscow two weeks ahead of a deadly March 22 terrorist attack included specific reference to the Crocus City Hall concert venue that was targeted, The Washington Post reported on April 2.According to the report, which was later confirmed by The New York Times, U.S. officials told Moscow that the Islamic State extremist group was plotting an attack and that Crocus City Hall was a potential target.However, three days before the attack, Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to acknowledge receiving the warnings, though he dismissed them as "provocative statements" by the West that were meant to "resemble outright blackmail and the intention to intimidate and destabilize our society."Four gunmen stormed the concert hall outside of Moscow just before a concert, killing 144 people in the deadliest terrorist attack in Russia since 2004. The Islamic State, a designated terrorist group, quickly claimed responsibility for the attack.Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials and commentators have claimed without evidence that Ukraine might have played a role in the attack. Ukrainian officials have denied any involvement and have accused Moscow of using the tragedy to ramp up its war against their country.The Crocus attack was a major failure for Russia's security forces, which critics say are focused on stifling domestic political dissent and opposition to the war against Ukraine, often prosecuting political opinions as "terrorism" or "extremism."Police in London say a March 29 stabbing of an Iranian journalist is being investigated by the Counter Terrorism Command, although investigators have not established a motive. A police statement on April 2 said the authorities believe three suspects were involved in the attack, in which self-exiled Persian-language journalist Pouria Zeraati suffered an injury to his leg. The three men abandoned their vehicle shortly after the incident and left the country by air within hours, police said. Zeraati works for Iran International television, which has been critical of Iran's government.An accidental oil leakage during production, discharge of industrial water containing petroleum products, or a possible emergency situation with service vessels are among the potential causes of a leak.But the North Caspian Operating Company (NCOC), a consortium largely owned by the Western oil companies that operate the offshore field, said the satellite images showed a different, natural phenomenon, and subsequent images of the same location showed nothing unusual.The NCOC on March 29 held public hearings on its work in the marine complex. Company managers said then that the company did not allow pollution of the air or the sea and referred to reports and presentations of NCOC specialists and project developers in which they said the company was striving for zero emissions in the local environment.Questions were also addressed to the Ecology Department of the Atyrau region about what measures had been taken to deal with the alleged spill and whether damage to the marine environment and biodiversity had been determined."If these facts are confirmed, the Department of Ecology for the Atyrau region will conduct an unscheduled inspection of the NCOC company. The results will be reported," the department said in a statement.The United States had no involvement in an air strike on Iran's consular annex building in the Syrian capital, Damascus, that Tehran blamed on Israel, the White House said on April 2. "We had nothing to do with the strike in Damascus. We weren't involved in any way whatsoever," National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told a briefing. Kirby dismissed as "nonsense" comments by Iran's foreign minister that the United States, Israel's main backer, bore responsibility for the attack, which killed seven members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.Authorities in Belarus have arrested a well-known activist on charges punishable by up to four years in prison, the Vyasna human rights group said on April 2. Dzmitry Kuchuk, whose Green Party was shut down last year, has been charged with organizing activities that grossly violate public order, according to Vyasna. The center said Kuchuk, 50, was arrested on February 16 in Minsk when he attempted to lay flowers and light a candle in memory of Russian opposition politician Aleksei Navalny, whose death was announced that day. Authorities ordered Kuchuk jailed for two 15-day periods before filing charges against him.NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has proposed creating a 100 billion-euro ($108 illion), five-year fund for Ukraine in a push to get the alliance more involved in sending weapons to Kyiv. NATO foreign ministers will hold preliminary talks on the plan in Brussels on April 3 as they seek to forge a support package for Ukraine by a July summit in Washington. "Foreign ministers will discuss the best way to organize NATO's support for Ukraine, to make it more powerful, predictable, and enduring," a NATO official said on April 2.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on April 2 signed into law a bill lowering the mobilization age from 27 to 25, the website of the Ukrainian parliament -- the Verkhovna Rada -- said. The bill was approved by lawmakers in May 2023. Media reports said earlier that Zelenskiy hesitated to sign the bill, saying that he needed to see a detailed plan by the military on how new recruits would be deployed to replace those who have been on the battlefield since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.The residents held a rally on April 1 on the heels of the announcement of the project by Tehran's municipality, with the mayor's office advocating for the construction of mosques in public spaces. Police maintained a significant presence at the protest site, though no disturbances were reported.The campaign, particularly for the mayor's proposal for a mosque in Qeytarieh Park, has drawn criticism for coming at a time when the city's financial resources could be better allocated toward supporting the underprivileged rather than constructing new religious structures.An official from the Cultural Heritage Department of Tehran Province announced that fences installed by the municipality around the site where the mosque is to be built had been dismantled, though the news has not been confirmed.The construction plan has drawn further scrutiny amid revelations last year by Mohammad Abolghassem Doulabi, a senior Iranian cleric, that 50,000 out of 75,000 mosques across the country had closed due to dwindling attendance.A lawyer for several survivors and relatives of victims of the terrorist attack at the Crocus City Hall entertainment center near Moscow said many have filed lawsuits against the venue's owners, accusing them of fire safety violations.On the night of the attack, the stage curtain -- supposedly made of fireproof material -- caught fire in seconds, the doors of many evacuation exits were locked, and the smoke removal system in the hall did not work, increasing the number of victims, according to lawyer Igor Trunov, who was quoted by RIA Novosti on April 2.Aras Agalarov, who has roots in Azerbaijan, said earlier that the fire safety system in the entertainment center was working properly when several men in military uniform rushed into the Crocus City Hall and started shooting minutes before a concert by the rock group Piknik on March 22.The Islamic State extremist group claimed responsibility for the attack, while Russian officials have said that Ukraine and Western countries were involved but have provided no evidence to support the claim.The U.S. Embassy in Moscow has slammed a Russian court ruling to extend the pretrial detention of RFE/RL journalist Alsu Kurmasheva until June 5, calling the countrys crackdown on independent media unacceptable.Kurmasheva, a Prague-based journalist with RFE/RL who holds dual U.S. and Russian citizenship, has been held in Russian custody since October 18 on a charge of violating the so-called "foreign agent" law.RFE/RL and the U.S. government say the charge is a reprisal for her work as journalist for RFE/RL. She had traveled to Russia to visit and care for her elderly mother and was initially detained while waiting for her return flight on June 2 at Kazan airport, where her passports were confiscated.We are deeply concerned about the detention of Alsu Kurmasheva in the Russian Federation, which the court extended, Ambassador Lynne Tracy said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, on April 2, adding that representatives from the embassy were present in court in Kazan.Before the court proceedings, Kurmasheva told reporters that she is "not very well physically" and that her living conditions in detention "are very bad. She added that she was receiving "minimal" medical care and that conditions in her cell were primitive, with a hole in the floor serving as a toilet.Kurmasheva, 47, was arrested in Kazan last October and charged with failing to register as a "foreign agent" under a punitive Russian law that targets journalists, civil society activists, and others. Shes also been charged with spreading falsehoods about the Russian military and faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.The prize, created in 1997, is an annual award that honors a person or a group of people who make an "outstanding" contribution to the defense and promotion of press freedom across the globe despite the "danger and persecution" they face.Kurmasheva is one of four RFE/RL journalists -- Andrey Kuznechyk, Ihar Losik, and Vladyslav Yesypenko are the other three -- currently imprisoned on charges related to their work. Rights groups and RFE/RL have called repeatedly for the release of all four, saying they have been wrongly detained.Losik is a blogger and contributor for RFE/RLs Belarus Service who was convicted in December 2021 on several charges including the organization and preparation of actions that grossly violate public order and sentenced to 15 years in prison.Kuznechyk, a web editor for RFE/RLs Belarus Service, was sentenced in June 2022 to six years in prison following a trial that lasted no more than a few hours. He was convicted of creating or participating in an extremist organization.Yesypenko, a dual Ukrainian-Russian citizen who contributed to Crimea.Realities, a regional news outlet of RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service, was sentenced in February 2022 to six years in prison by a Russian judge in occupied Crimea after a closed-door trial. He was convicted of possession and transport of explosives, a charge he steadfastly denies.Police in Russia's Komi Republic detained activist Dmitry Makhov on April 2 for using a picture of the historical flag of Belarus online. Makhov was charged with displaying an extremist symbol on a social network. The white-red-white flag was used by the short-lived Belarusian Democratic Republic in 1918-1920 and reinstated after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. In 1995, the authoritarian ruler of Belarus, Alyaksandr Lukashenka, replaced the historical flag with one similar to that used in the Soviet era. Opposition groups have used the historical flag as their symbol for decades.

"It is absolutely essential to get Ukrainians what they continue to need to defend themselves, particularly when it comes to munitions and air defenses," Blinken told reporters during a visit to France. "It's another reason why the supplementary budget request that President [Joe] Biden has made to [the U.S.] Congress must be fulfilled as quickly as possible."Tehran has vowed revenge after several people, including a senior commander of Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), were killed in an air strike on the Iranian Consulate in Damascus over the weekend that has been attributed to Israel.Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on April 2 that Israel will be made to "regret" the strike at the Iranian Embassy compound in Damascus, which killed Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior commander of the IRGC's Quds Force, and six others believed to be IRGC members.Israel has not said it carried out the attack, though it has ramped up its campaign of air strikes on targets associated with Iran since a war against Hamas, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union, broke out in the Gaza Strip in October. Hamas is supported by Tehran.Military sources said Israeli missiles were fired from the occupied Golan Heights and that the Syrian air defense system intercepted a number of them, though some hit their target, leading to the "total destruction of the building" and the killing and wounding of "everyone inside."Israel -- as per its usual policy -- has not commented on the strike, but the Reuters news agency quoted a senior Israeli government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, as saying those hit had "been behind many attacks on Israeli and American assets and had plans for additional attacks."The White House said it was aware of the reports. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said at a daily news briefing that Washington was "concerned about anything that would be escalatory or cause an increase in conflict in the region."Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian told his Syrian counterpart, Faisal Mekdad, in a phone call that his government holds Israel responsible for the attack and labeled it a breach of all international conventions," according to Iranian state TV.Ali Shamkhani, a political adviser to Khamenei, said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that the United States "remains directly responsible whether or not it was aware of the intention to carry out this attack."If you are in Russia or the Russia-controlled parts of Ukraine and hold a Russian passport or are a stateless person residing permanently in Russia or the Russia-controlled parts of Ukraine, please note that you could face fines or imprisonment for sharing, liking, commenting on, or saving our content, or for contacting us.

Many parts of Ukraine were experiencing blackouts after a massive wave of Russian strikes on March 22 targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, killing at least four people, hitting the country's largest dam, and temporarily severing a power line at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant.As the full-scale invasion neared the 25-month mark, Zelenskiy aide Mykhailo Podolyak denied recent reports that the United States had demanded that its ally Kyiv stop any attacks on Russia's oil infrastructure as "fictitious information.""After two years of full-scale war, no one will dictate to Ukraine the conditions for conducting this war," Podolyak told the Dozhd TV channel. "Within the framework of international law, Ukraine can 'degrease' Russian instruments of war. Fuel is the main tool of warfare. Ukraine will destroy the [Russian] fuel infrastructure."The Financial Times quoted anonymous sources as saying that Washington had given "repeated warnings" to Ukraine's state security service and its military intelligence agency to stop attacking Russian oil refineries and energy infrastructure. It said officials cited such attacks' effect on global oil prices and the risk of retaliation.The southern Zaporizhzhya region bore the brunt of the Russian assault that hit Ukraine's energy infrastructure particularly hard on March 22, with at least three people killed, including a man and his 8-year-old daughter. There were at least 20 dead and injured, in all.Ukraine's state hydropower company, Ukrhydroenerho, said the DniproHES hydroelectric dam on the Dnieper in Zaporizhzhya was hit by two Russian missiles that damaged HPP-2, one of the plant's two power stations, although there was no immediate risk of a breach."There is currently a fire at the dam. Emergency services are working at the site, eliminating the consequences of numerous air strikes," Ukrhydroenerho said in a statement, adding that the situation at the dam "is under control.""The world sees the Russian terrorists' targets as clearly as possible: power plants and energy supply lines, a hydroelectric dam, ordinary residential buildings, and even a trolleybus," Zelenskiy wrote."Currently, the temporarily occupied Zaporizhzhya NPP is connected to the unified energy system of Ukraine by two power transmission lines, thanks to which the plant's own needs are fulfilled," the state's nuclear-energy operator wrote on Telegram."The occupiers carried out more than 15 strikes on energy facilities. The city is virtually completely without light," Oleh Synyehubov, the head of Kharkiv regional military administration, wrote on Telegram.In the Odesa region, more than 50,000 households have been left without electricity, regional officials reported. Odesa, Ukraine's largest Black Sea port, has been frequently attacked by Russia in recent months."There are problems with the electricity supply in some areas, but in general, the situation in the energy sector is under control, there is no need for blackouts throughout the country," Shmyhal wrote on Telegram.Ukrenerho also said that it was receiving emergency assistance from its European Union neighbors Poland, Romania, and Slovakia. Ukraine linked its power grid with that of the EU in March 2022, shortly after the start of Russia's invasion."Russian missiles have no delays, unlike aid packages for Ukraine. 'Shahed' drones have no indecision, unlike some politicians. It is critical to understand the cost of delays and postponed decisions," Zelenskiy wrote, appealing to the West to do more for his country.Zelenskiy's message came as EU leaders were wrapping up a summit in Brussels where they discussed ways to speed up ammunition and weapons deliveries for the embattled Ukrainian forces struggling to stave off an increasingly intense assault by more numerous and better-equipped Russian troops.A critical $60 billion military aid package from the United States, Ukraine's main backer, remains stuck in the House of Representatives due to Republican opposition, prompting Kyiv to rely more on aid from its European allies.

EU initiatives against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine have always excluded the agricultural sector. This is meant to avoid side effects on global food security, as Russia is the worlds largest exporter of wheat and a major player in the global fertiliser market.Today, the solidity of these considerations is crumbling in the face of the political necessity to rebuild the pro-Ukrainian front, worn down by months of farmers protests, especially in Eastern Europe.At an EU summit on Thursday, the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is expected to present to EU leaders proposals to restrict food imports from Russia, imposing duties on Moscow cereals.It has backfired, as the collapse in prices caused by the sharp increase in imports of food commodities, mainly cereals, has been one of the key drivers of the farmers protests in Eastern European countries, particularly in Poland, in recent months.In the meantime, according to European Commission data, the EU imported 1.1 million tonnes of cereals from Russia between July 2023 and January 2024, with each monthly import higher than the five-year average for the comparable month.At a time when the price of cereals has sunk to its lowest level since 2020, and the Black Sea Ukrainian corridor exports are resuming, the idea is to ease the pressure on the EU market by restricting access to Russian wheat and other grains.The Latvian Parliament approved a unilateral ban on the import (allowing only transit) of Russian agricultural products. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, under pressure like no one else from farmers protests, said he wanted to follow suit.Last week, in a joint statement with Tusk, von der Leyen announced that the Commission was evaluating the possibility of introducing restrictions on imports of agricultural products from Russia to the European Union and will come forward with a proposal shortly.After sharing a consensus, the political leaders will have to convince the farmers. Russian wheat production over the last two seasons has undoubtedly been at a record high. It is also true that imports of Russian cereals into the EU have increased.But it is hard to see how having 1.1 million or even 1.5 million tonnes less can bring relief for prices and farmers in a continent expected to produce more than 272 million tonnes of grains this year.The EUs auditing body has warned that the European Commissions strategy of relying on member states to ensure the money of the pandemic recovery fund is properly spent is heightening the risk of irregularity or even corruption.Former Italian prime minister Enrico Letta, in charge of the long-awaited Single Market Report, wants to propose a tool resembling tax credits used by the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), he said on Tuesday.Frances Minister for the Armed Forces, Sbastien Lecornu, announced on Monday a new production cycle for tritium, which is essential for the manufacture of nuclear weapons, using state utility EDFs two civilian reactors.The future of the Nature Restoration Law remains uncertain, and the position of key member states is still not clear ahead of an ambassadors meeting on Friday (22 March) to prepare a final vote next Monday.The European Parliaments Industry, Research, and Energy committee voted on Wednesday to improve access for small businesses and startups to artificial intelligence (AI) supercomputers, as well as strengthen environmental standards for such infrastructure.Maltas Socialist (S&D) Prime Minister Robert Abela and President of European Parliament Roberta Metsola, who is a member of the countrys opposition Nationalist Party (EPP), are trading blows over a decades-old debate on using the Maltese language in the institution.Leftists in the European Parliament claimed the top spot in the ranking of political groups environmental performance published by the French environmental association Bloom on Wednesday, with those on the right relegated to the bottom of the table.Lead-producing Bulgaria has the potential to be a major battery supplier and harness the economic opportunities of the green transition, but current EU policies prioritise lithium-ion batteries, participants heard at a conference in Brussels on Tuesday.With the decision to expand NATOs military base near the strategic Black Sea port of Constanta, Romania will have stronger security guarantees, a representative of the Romanian Defence Ministry told Euractiv on Tuesday.

The Biden administration and dozens of other countries have pledged to triple the capacity of nuclear power worldwide in their battle against climate change, ensuring uranium will remain a key commodity for decades as the government offers incentives for developing the next generation of nuclear reactors and new policies take aim at Russia's influence over the supply chain.But as the U.S. pursues its nuclear power potential, environmentalists and Native American leaders remain fearful of the consequences for communities near mining and milling sites in the West and are demanding better regulatory oversight.Producers say uranium production today is different than decades ago when the country was racing to build up its nuclear arsenal. Those efforts during World War II and the Cold War left a legacy of death, disease and contamination on the Navajo Nation and in other communities across the country, making any new development of the ore a hard pill to swallow for many.The new mining at Pinyon Plain Mine near the Grand Canyon's South Rim entrance is happening within the boundaries of the Baaj Nwaavjo Itah Kukv National Monument that was designated in August by President Joe Biden. The work was allowed to move forward since Energy Fuels Inc. had valid existing rights.The mine will cover only 17 acres (6.8 hectares) and will operate for three to six years, producing at least 2 million pounds (about 907,000 kilograms) of uranium  enough to power the state of Arizona for at least a year with carbon-free electricity, he said.Energy Fuels, which also is prepping two more mines in Colorado and Wyoming, has produced about two-thirds of the uranium in the U.S. in the last five years. In 2022, it was awarded a contract to sell $18.5 million in uranium concentrates to the U.S. government to help establish the nations strategic reserve for when supplies might be disrupted.Amid the growing appetite for uranium, a coalition of Native Americans testified before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in late February, asking the panel to pressure the U.S. government to overhaul outdated mining laws and prevent further exploitation of marginalized communities.Carletta Tilousi, who served for years on the Havasupai Tribal Council, said she and others have written countless letters to state and federal agencies and sat through hours of meetings with regulators and lawmakers. Her tribe's reservation lies in a gorge off the Grand Canyon.A group of hydrology and geology professors and nuclear watchdogs sent Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs a letter in January, asking she reconsider permits granted by state environmental regulators that cleared the way for the mine. She has yet to respond and her office declined to answer questions from The Associated Press.Lawyers for Energy Fuels said in a letter to state officials that reopening the permits would be an improper attempt to side step Arizonas administrative procedures and rights protecting permit holders from such politicized actions.The environmentalists' request followed a plea weeks earlier by the Havasupai saying mining at the foot of Red Butte will compromise one of the tribe's most sacred spots. Called Wiii Gdwiisa by the Havasupai, the landmark is central to tribal creation stories and also holds significance for the Hopi, Navajo and Zuni people.It is with heavy hearts that we must acknowledge that our greatest fear has come true, the Havasupai said in a January statement, reflecting on concerns that mining could affect water supplies, wildlife, plants and geology throughout the Colorado Plateau.The U.S. Geological Survey recently partnered with the Havasupai Tribe to examine contamination possibilities that could include exposure through inhalation and ingestion of traditional food and medicines, processing animal hides or absorption through materials collected for face and body painting.Legal challenges aimed at stopping the Pinyon Plain Mine repeatedly have been rejected by the courts, and top officials in the Biden administration are reticent to weigh in beyond speaking generally about efforts to improve consultation with Native American tribes.It marks another front in an ongoing battle over energy development and sacred lands, as tribes in Nevada and Arizona are fighting the federal government over the mining of lithium and the siting of renewable energy transmission lines.The Pinyon Plain Mine, formerly known as the Canyon Mine, was permitted in 1984. Because it retained existing rights, the mine effectively became grandfathered into legal operation despite a 20-year moratorium placed on uranium mining in the Grand Canyon region by the Obama administration in 2012.The U.S. Forest Service in 2012 reaffirmed an environmental impact statement that had been prepared for the mine years earlier, and state regulators signed off on air and aquifer protection permitting within the past two years.Environmental reviews conducted as part of the permitting process have concluded the mine's operation won't affect visitors to the national park, area residents or groundwater or springs associated with the park. Still, environmentalists say the mine raises a bigger question about the Biden administration's willingness to adopt policies favorable of nuclear power.The U.S. Commerce Department under the Trump administration issued a 2019 report describing domestic production as essential to national security, citing the need to maintain the nuclear arsenal and keep commercial nuclear reactors fueled to generate electricity. At that point, nuclear reactors supplied nearly 20% of the electricity consumed in the U.S.The Biden administration is staying the course. It's in the midst of a multibillion-dollar modernization of the nation's nuclear defense capabilities, and the U.S. Energy Department on Wednesday offered a $1.5 billion loan to the owners of a Michigan power plant to restart the shuttered facility, which would mark a first in the U.S.Taylor McKinnon, the Center for Biological Diversity's Southwest director, said pushing for more nuclear power and allowing mining near the Grand Canyon makes a mockery of the administration's environmental justice rhetoric."Using nuclear power to reach emissions goals is a hard sell in the western U.S. From the Navajo Nation to Ute Mountain Ute and Oglala Lakota homelands, tribal communities have deep-seated distrust of uranium companies and the federal government as abandoned mines and related contamination have yet to be cleaned up.A complex of mines on the Navajo Nation recently was added to the federal Superfund list. The eastern edge of the reservation also is home to the largest radioactive accident in U.S. history. In 1979, more than 93 million gallons (350 million liters) of radioactive and acidic slurry spilled from a tailings disposal pond, contaminating water supplies, livestock and downstream communities. It was three times the radiation released at the Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania just three months earlier.Teracita Keyanna with the Red Water Pond Road Community Association got choked up while testifying before the human rights commission in Washington, D.C., saying federal regulators proposed keeping contaminated soil onsite rather than removing it.It's really unfair that we have to deal with this and my children have to deal with this and later on, my grandchildren have to deal with this, she said. Why is the government just feeling like we're disposable. We're not.Congresswoman Cori Bush of Missouri said during a congressional meeting in January that lawmakers can't talk about expanding nuclear energy in the U.S. without first dealing with the effects that nuclear waste has had on minority communities. Bush pointed to her own district in St. Louis, where waste was left behind from the uranium refining required by the top-secret Manhattan Project.

Foreign Policy, 655 15th St NW, Suite 300, Washington, DC, 20005.Russian President Vladimir Putin extended his reign for a fifth term on Sunday in a presidential election whose outcome was predetermined. Putin, 71, won 87 percent of the vote, his highest tally since coming to power in 1999. He is the longest-serving Russian leader since Joseph Stalin, and if he sees his term to its end in 2030, he will be the longest-serving Russian leader since Catherine the Great.Moscows three-day election, held this weekend, was the least transparent vote in recent Russian history, according to independent Russian vote-monitoring group Golos. All genuine opposition candidates were barred from running, imprisoned, dead, or in exile. The only three people allowed to run posed no real threat to Putins hold on power. Much of the international community blames Putin directly for the death of his main opponent, Alexei Navalny, who died in a Russian penal colony last month.Russian officials said voter turnout reached 77 percent this weekend, hitting a record high since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. Yet Golos documented more than 1,400 reports of potential electoral violations, including vote-stuffing, by midafternoon on Sunday. Locals in Russian-occupied areas of eastern Ukraine were reportedly instructed to vote under the watch of armed Russian troops, and anyone found to have obstructed voting procedures was threatened with up to five years in prison.The elections are obviously not free nor fair, U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky further condemned the vote, saying: These days, the Russian dictator is simulating another election. It is clear to everyone in the world that this figure, as it has already often happened in the course of history, is simply sick for power and is doing everything to rule forever.In his victory speech, Putin lauded Russias war on Ukraine as helping to consolidate society around his leadership. He also warned that direct confrontation between Russia and NATO would be one step away from a full-scale World War III, adding that anything is possible in todays world. Regional experts predict that Putin will use his victory to possibly launch new unpopular policies, as is historic practice for the Kremlinpotentially including a new military mobilization order.Hospital attack. Israel launched a raid on Al-Shifa Hospital, the largest medical center in the Gaza Strip, on Monday. According to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), troops conducted a precise operation to thwart terrorist activity in the complex, targeting senior Hamas officials allegedly inside the building. The IDF said it detained 80 suspects and killed 20 militants, including Faiq Mabhouh, the head of operations for the Hamas governments internal security forces. The Gaza Health Ministry said Israeli soldiers killed numerous Palestinian civilians sheltering in and around Al-Shifa during the raid.This was the second major assault on Al-Shifas facility since war broke out on Oct. 7, 2023. Last November, Israeli forces raided Al-Shifa after claiming that Hamas had a command center within and beneath the hospital. According to the Gaza Health Ministry, around 30,000 Palestinians, including patients and medical staff, are currently in the complex.Also on Monday, Israeli negotiators traveled to Doha, Qatar, to resume cease-fire talks. Israeli officials hope to secure the release of all hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza. Hamas leaders continue to call for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and more humanitarian aid deliveries, among other demands. Dialogue comes as the European Unions foreign-policy chief, Josep Borrell, accused Israel over the weekend of provoking famine in Gaza.Summit for Democracy. South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol kicked off the three-day Summit for Democracy on Monday by calling on countries to work together to combat fake news and disinformation. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken echoed his remarks, adding that as authoritarian and repressive regimes deploy technologies to undermine democracy and human rights, we need to ensure that technology sustains and supports democratic values and norms.As the proceedings got underway, though, North Korea launched several short-range ballistic missiles into the Pacific waters off its eastern coast on Monday. Seoul, along with Japan and the United States, called the military actions a clear provocation, and mere hours later, South Korean Defense Minister Shin Won-sik accused Pyongyang of shipping around 7,000 containers carrying munitions and other military equipment to Moscow last year.Antiterrorist operations. Pakistan launched two airstrikes into eastern Afghanistan on Monday, killing at least eight people, including three children. Pakistans foreign ministry said it had carried out intelligence-based antiterrorist operations and accused the Taliban of aiding militants associated with Jaish-e-Mohammed, an Islamist group connected to the Pakistani Taliban that allegedly attacked a military post near the Afghan border over the weekend.Terrorism against us is mostly being conducted from Afghanistan, said Pakistani Defense Minister Khawaja Asif. The Afghan Taliban denied the accusations. Last year, most of the more than 650 attacks reported in Pakistan targeted provinces that bordered Afghanistan. And Islamabad maintains that its main adversary is Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, a militant group ideologically aligned with the Afghan Taliban.There may be such a thing as too much money. Australian billionaire Clive Palmer announced last Wednesday that he is relaunching efforts to build Titanic II, arguing that its a lot more fun to do the Titanic than it is to sit at home and count my money.

Last year, the Coalition was all over the purported future of nuclear power, constantly reiterating that SMRs were the solution to Australias energy needs. With the plug-and-play of the new smallmodular reactors, you can replace the coal-fired generation and distribute through the existing network, Peter Dutton said.Indeed, SMRs are the only feasible firming option he told an economic conference. The only thing that was in the way was the ideology of old hippies in Labor. Otherwise, we could just plug and play our way to unlimited atomic power.Alas, pack your bags, SMRs. As of yesterday, and fresh off what even the press gallery is now describing as a poor outcome in Dunkley, the opposition leader has moved on to large nuclear reactors. In the Financial Review, Phil Coorey cruelly quoted Duttons hapless LNP energy shadow Ted OBrien last year referring to how nobody wants old Soviet technology, you wouldnt touch it with a barge pole.What has changed is the only company in the US trying to build an SMR, NuScale Power in Idaho, cancelled its project in November. OBrien, humiliatingly, had touted NuScale in a piece for News Corp in May. NuScales integrated reactors offer exceptional flexibility with modulars making for simple expansion. Its first build will be in Idaho in 2029, OBrien trilled.OBrien hadnt done his research  the Idaho SMR died, despite more than US$1 billion in government subsidies, because no-one wanted to pay $89/MWh for power, which is the cost the company revealed last January. NuScale had previously claimed the SMR would produce power at $58/MWh.Ah cost increases.On Monday, French newspaper Les Echos reported that French state-owned utility EDF had raised its already large cost estimate for the construction of six new nuclear reactors from 51.7 billion to 67.4 billion (US$73 billion or A$110 billion)  and flagged costs could rise higher. France gets 70% of its electricity from nuclear power and now needs to build new plans to replace ageing operations built in the 1960s and 1970s.This is unrelated to the cost blowouts at EDFs Flamanville project (or Phlegm Orville as the Institute of Public Affairs calls it), which is more than a decade late and at least triple its original estimate (its been under construction since 2007). Dutton has touted both major EDF projects.EDF also has to fund the construction of the Hinkley Point reactor project in the UK. Originally budgeted at 20 billion, then 26-27 billion in 2022, last year EDF revised the cost up to 32.7 billion, or more than A$63 billion. Originally scheduled to be completed in 2027, Hinkley Point has been delayed to at least 2029-31.EDF is the most experienced nuclear power operator in the Western world, and if it cant get its costings right, then no-one can. The French governments expensive re-nationalisation of the utility in 2023 was an admission that nuclear power is not a commercially viable sector.These massive cost increases and delays come with a real cost for consumers. As the NuScale debacle illustrates, endless construction cost increases  and the debt they demand for the companies behind the projects  push up the eventual cost per MWh for consumers.The poster child for this is the Vogtle project in Georgia  two new nuclear power reactors to go with two older installations, which cost an estimated US$35 billion (A$53 billion), compared to an initial costing of US$14 billion. The Trump administration was forced to step in to guarantee US$12 billion in debt for the project, which ended up eight years late. Vogtles estimated electricity costs are US$170180/MWh  including an extra 10% a month to help offset the final uncovered costs of the reactors.Never mind the which electorate will the reactors go in stuff: this is what Dutton is now selling  decade-long delays, cost blowouts in the tens of billions, monstrously expensive power, government debt guarantees as the very least, and likely a direct government role in funding the power industry.Many have now cottoned on to the fact that  as Crikey has been saying for years  proposing nuclear power in Australia is simply a delaying tactic to prop up coal-fired power. But Dutton is proposing a colossal big-government policy that will risk the federal budget, force consumers to pay extraordinary power costs, and, of course, deliver nothing until the 2040s.Is there merit to Duttons nuclear proposal?

Once upon a time, America embraced nuclear power as the future of energy. Today it accounts for a mere 18 percent of the nation's electricity generation, while fossil fuels remain dominant at 60 percent. Why did nuclear fail to take off?From 1967 to 1972, the nuclear sector experienced significant growth, and 48 new nuclear plants were built. But in March 1979, a meltdown at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, which resulted in no casualties and no lingering environmental damage, spooked the entire nation and empowered anti-nuclear activists."After Three Mile Island, what was considered to be in the best interest of the public was just reducing risk to as low as possible," says Adam Stein, director of the Nuclear Energy Innovation Program at the Breakthrough Institute. "It resulted in a huge volume of regulations that anybody who wanted to build a new reactor had to know. It made the learning curve much steeper to even attempt to innovate in the industry."After the incident, the momentum behind nuclear reactor construction tapered off and no new reactors were built for the next two decades. Nowadays, the landscape remains unchanged: The federal government makes permitting arduous, while many states impose severe restrictions on new plant construction and force operational ones to shut down prematurely.For example, take Indian Point Energy Center, the largest nuclear plant in New York State. In 2007, anti-nuclear activists targeted the plant, which provided a quarter of downstate New York's electricity. Their cause gained significant traction with the support of New York state attorney generaland future governorAndrew Cuomo, who believed the nuclear plant was "risky."Cuomo promised to usher in a new era of clean energy for New Yorkers. His moves against Indian Point garnered support from fellow Green New Deal advocates, including Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (DN.Y.), as well as environmental groups.The plant eventually closed in April 2021, but there was "a gulf between intentions and results," explains writer Eric Dawson, co-founder of Nuclear New York, a group fighting to protect the industry. The closure of Indian Point increased New York's carbon emissions. State utilities had to make up for the loss of energy by burning more natural gas, resulting in a 9 percent increase in energy-related CO2 emissions. At the same time, the state's energy prices also increased.This outcome isn't unique to New York. Germany also opted to phase out nuclear power, betting on wind instead. Electricity from windmills increased, but so did the country's reliance on coal. In 2023, Germany emitted almost eight times the carbon per kilowatt-hour than neighboring France, which still gets the majority of its electricity from nuclear and less than 1 percent from coal.According to Dawson, nuclear power is "the most scalable, reliable, efficient, land-conserving, material-sparing, zero-emission source of energy ever created." Wind and solar aren't as reliable because they depend on intermittent weather. They also require much more land than nuclear plants, which use about 1 percent of what solar farms need and 0.3 percent of what wind farms require to yield the same amount of energy.The economics of nuclear power are undoubtedly challenging, but its advocates say that's primarily because of its thorny politics. The headache of building a new power plant is vividly exemplified by Georgia's Plant Vogtle. The first U.S. reactor built from scratch since 1974, the project turned into a nightmare scenario: It took almost 17 years from when the first permit was filed for construction to begin, it cost more than $28 billion, and it bankrupted the developer in the process.Nuclear regulation is "based on politics and fear-mongering and a lack of understanding," explains Indian Point's vice president, Frank Spagnuolo. If they aren't shut down, he says, power plants such as Indian Point could safely continue to provide clean energy for decades.Despite the opposition, there remains some hope for the future of nuclear energy. Companies are actively developing next-generation nuclear technologies, such as small modular reactors and molten salt-cooled reactors, to minimize the risks associated with nuclear meltdowns and explosions. And some former nuclear opponents have become advocates, acknowledging it as a vital source of clean energy. The converts include the Environmental Defense Fund, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and even Rep. Ocasio-Cortez. The Biden administration has also demonstrated support for nuclear power, with the Department of Energy projecting a tripling of nuclear energy production in America by 2050.Photo Credits: Louis Lanzano/Polaris/Newscom; Erik McGregor/Pacific Press/Newscom; JB NICHOLAS/Splash News/Newscom; Erik Mcgregor/ZUMA Press/Newscom; Erik Thomas/NY Post/MEGA/Newscom/DBNYC/Newscom; Pool/ABACA/Newscom; Jon G.

1. The eleventh United States-European Union (EU) Energy Council   ("Council") met today in Washington, chaired by U.S. Deputy Secretary of   State Kurt Campbell, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy David M. Turk,   European Commissioner for Energy Kadri Simson, and EEAS Acting Deputy   Secretary General Blen Martinez Carbonell. The Deputy Head of Mission   of the Kingdom of Belgium to the United States of America, Sophie   Karlshausen, represented the Presidency of the Council of the European   Union.2. The U.S.-EU Energy Council serves as the lead transatlantic forum   for coordinating strategic energy issues at political and technical   levels. Transatlantic energy cooperation is vital to advancing diverse   and resilient energy systems, bolstering energy security, promoting   stability and transparency in global energy markets, and accelerating   just energy transitions consistent with our mutual commitment to   net-zero greenhouse gas emissions at home and globally by 2050.3. On this occasion, the Council also recognized the important work   of the U.S.-EU Task Force on Energy Security, which helped ensure the   EU's energy security, achieve a 99% EU natural gas storage filling level   ahead of the winter 2023-24, and phase out reliance on Russian fossil   fuels. Moving forward, the EU and the US will continue working closely   together and build on these efforts to ensure energy security in Europe   and beyond and contribute to decarbonization globally.4. The Council welcomed the outcome of the first global stocktake   under the Paris Agreement, including the call on all Paris Agreement   Parties to come forward in their next nationally determined   contributions with ambitious, economy-wide emission reduction targets,   covering all greenhouse gases, sectors and categories and aligned with   limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Council also   emphasized the need for the world to transition away from fossil fuels   in energy systems in a just, orderly, and equitable manner, accelerating   action in this critical decade, so as to achieve net zero by 2050 in   keeping with the science.5. In this context, the Council reiterated the urgency of phasing out   unabated coal in the energy sector globally, in particular ending the   continued investment in new coal-fired power plants. The Council   underlined its commitment to advance on the COP28 goals of tripling   renewable energy capacity and doubling the global average annual rate of   energy efficiency improvements by 2030, including through action at   national, regional, and local levels. Energy systems with diverse and   resilient supply chains that do not overly rely on a single supplier for   fuels, critical raw materials and minerals, or other inputs are key to   reducing dependencies and countering attempts to weaponize energy.6. The Council reaffirmed its enduring commitment to Ukraine and its   people. We strongly condemn Russia's illegal and unprovoked war of   aggression against Ukraine, including attacks on the nation's energy and   civil infrastructure. We stress the need to continue military support,   notably air defense, to protect such infrastructure, and are increasing   our efforts to provide humanitarian aid and critical energy sector   assistance. We reiterate our demand for Russia to immediately and   unconditionally withdraw all its military forces and equipment from the   entire territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized   borders. The Council stresses the importance of security and stability   in the Black Sea.7. The Council acknowledged the important contributions of the United   States, the EU, and its Member States, including through the G7+   coordination group, to provide Ukraine with essential material,   technical, and financial assistance to rapidly repair, restore, and   defend its energy systems and to support Ukraine's efforts to build a   more resilient, sustainable, and decentralized energy system that is   more integrated with Europe. The Council highlighted the will of the G7+   group to work with Ukraine on its Integrated National Energy and   Climate Plan and to implement the Clean Energy Partnership including   further necessary reforms, which are essential to attracting private   sector investment for Ukraine's green recovery and reconstruction.8. The Council welcomed Ukraine's formal membership in the European   Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) and   commended the completion of required actions to enable its permanent   synchronization with the power systems of continental Europe. This   milestone enhances regional energy security and helps enable Ukraine and   Europe to accelerate the broader energy transition. The United States   and the EU also recalled the growing number of cyber and physical   threats to energy infrastructure and plan to continue related   cooperation to bolster resilient energy systems, including in the   context of the ongoing synchronization of the Baltic States' electricity   networks with the Continental European Network.9. The Council reiterated its strong condemnation of Russia's   continued control as well as irresponsible and dangerous actions at and   around Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) that puts   countless people at risk. The Council reaffirmed its support for the   five concrete principles presented by the International Atomic Energy   Agency (IAEA) Director General to the UN Security Council and for the   Agency's work to apply safeguards and assist Ukraine in managing the   safety and security of its nuclear facilities. The Council welcomed   Ukraine joining the IAEA Board of Governors. The United States and the   EU strongly call on Russia to heed the resolutions of the IAEA Board of   Governors and General Conference, to unconditionally withdraw its   personnel and military equipment from the ZNPP, to give full and   unhindered access to IAEA experts to all areas of the ZNPP, and to   return its full control to its rightful owner, Ukraine.10. The Council reiterated its strongest commitment to confront, with   adequate measures, Russia's efforts to destabilize the global energy   markets and to circumvent sanctions. In this context, the Council   intends to continue intensifying cooperation on the enforcement of the   oil price cap, coordinating bilateral and multilateral responses to   mitigate excessive market volatility, supporting the energy transition   required to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, and continue   cooperative measures on energy efficiency, electrification, and other   initiatives to reduce reliance on fossil fuels in general, and Russian   fossil fuels in particular in order to limit Russia's ability to finance   its war of aggression against Ukraine. We reaffirmed our resolve to   continue taking steps to limit Russia's future energy revenue, which   directly supports the brutal war against Ukraine.11. To promote energy diversification, security, resilience and   sustainability, the Council recalled the strategic importance of energy   relations with partner countries in regions such as the Caspian Sea,   Black Sea, Eastern Mediterranean, and North Africa. The pivotal role of   reliable energy partners in these regions calls for mutually beneficial   cooperation on security of energy supplies as well as enhanced   cooperation on critical infrastructure.12. The Council reaffirmed that the future of Ukraine, the Republic   of Moldova, the Western Balkans, as well as Georgia, and their citizens,   lies with the EU and would continue supporting their integration with   the EU, including through the enlargement process as a matter of   priority for the years to come.13. The Council welcomed the European Council's 14 December 2023   decision to also open EU accession negotiations with Ukraine and the   Republic of Moldova and reaffirmed continued support for their citizens.   The Council intends to continue assisting the countries' long-term   economic and energy transition towards climate neutrality and   integration with the EU's energy system, including by accelerating the   development of energy infrastructure and interconnections. The Council   welcomed Ukraine's and the Republic of Moldova's reform efforts towards   meeting the objectives underpinning their candidacy for EU membership   and encouraged the countries to continue to make progress on these   reforms.14. The Council reaffirmed that both sides intend to deepen   cooperation to support regional integration and energy sector   investments to achieve climate neutrality in the Western Balkans,   including by supporting decarbonization efforts and phasing out their   dependency on coal and Russian natural gas and oil imports as soon as   possible. The United States and the EU continue to promote transparent,   integrated, and competitive energy markets in the Western Balkans, in   line with EU enlargement policy, as well as with the climate and energy   objectives and obligations under the Energy Community Treaty.15. The United States and the EU pledged to continue to cooperate   closely, at multilateral and bilateral levels, to encourage investments   and complementary policies, standards, and regulations in the transition   towards climate neutrality. Including through our Clean Energy   Incentives Dialogue, we intend to work in a transparent and mutually   reinforcing manner, to avoid zero-sum competition and distortions in   transatlantic trade and investment flows that could arise from our   respective policies and incentives.16. The Council welcomed the 2023 announcement of an international   working group to establish an internationally aligned approach, which   builds on existing frameworks on greenhouse gas supply chain emissions   measurement, monitoring, reporting and verification (MMRV) framework for   providing transparent, comparable, and reliable information to natural   gas market participants.17. The Council intends to continue advancing the implementation of   the Global Methane Pledge, including through promoting effective global   schemes to limit leakage, venting, and flaring in the natural gas, oil,   and coal sector, with particular attention to reducing methane emissions   from internationally-traded fossil fuels. The Council recognized the   UNEP's International Methane Emissions Observatory as a key independent   methane emissions data collector and verifier, and intends to continue   to support its initiatives, including the Oil and Gas Methane   Partnership 2.0 and the Methane Alert and Response System with strong   industry engagement.18. Further, the Council noted the role that nuclear power can play   in decarbonizing energy systems in countries that have decided or will   decide to rely on nuclear energy. The United States and the EU intend to   intensify cooperation to reduce dependency on Russia for nuclear   materials and fuel cycle services, and support ongoing efforts by   affected EU Member States to diversify nuclear supplies, as appropriate.   The Council expressed support for multilateral efforts to identify   alternative nuclear energy-related suppliers across the global nuclear   supply chain for relevant countries.19. The Council noted interest in enhancing cooperation to promote   the development of rules-based and transparent global hydrogen markets   based on reliable international standards and certification schemes   primarily through mutually agreed-upon international platforms.20. The Council noted the vital importance of diversifying and   securing supply chains for critical minerals and raw materials as well   as voluntary stockpiling necessary for the energy transition to   climate-neutrality and reinforced the value of U.S.-EU collaboration in   fora such as the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) and its newly   established MSP Forum, the Conference on Critical Materials and   Minerals, and the International Energy Agency Critical Minerals Working   Party, as well as the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and   Investment. The Council welcomed a jointly drafted discussion paper on   lithium supply for the energy transition and signaled support for a set   of U.S.-EU focused stakeholder roundtables over the coming year and an   accompanying recommendations document to map pathways to foster supply   chain linkages between the United States and the EU.21. Furthering last year's Council endorsement to build on existing   dialogues and frameworks, the Council noted research and innovation   cooperation advancements in the fields of i) fusion research,   development, and commercialization, in particular based on the new Model   Project Agreement, and through the ITER Project, and ii) mutual   modelling capabilities for transition pathways to climate-neutrality. In   particular, the Council welcomed joint work on scenario development of   transition pathways with applications of machine learning.22. As the United States and the EU scale up policies and   technologies that intend to drive decarbonization particularly in hard   to abate sectors, carbon capture and storage has emerged as an area for   joint cooperation. Following a series of policy exchanges, the Council   identified two technology and innovation collaboration areas: CO2   transport and carbon capture demonstrations for emerging applications.23. The Council noted the U.S.-EU co-convened workshop in 2023 on   just transition, energy poverty, and economic and workforce development   assistance for communities in transition, disadvantaged communities, and   communities experiencing environmental hazard exposure. Further, the   Council supported the intent to hold a second workshop, focused on   multi-level governance in energy poverty policies, to take place in   2024, followed by the publication of a joint summary document.24. Looking ahead and building on the aforementioned joint   activities, the United States and the EU intend to continue to   ambitiously and resolutely strengthen their strategic relationship to   ensure energy security, align policies, and deepen cooperation on   technologies and innovation, all with the aim of accelerating the global   transition to climate neutrality. The United States and the EU intend   to also continue working closely together to this end in international   fora.
