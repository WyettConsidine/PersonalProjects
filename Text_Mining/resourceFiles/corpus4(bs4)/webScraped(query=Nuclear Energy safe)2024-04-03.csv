By  Justine Calma, a senior science reporter covering climate change, clean energy, and environmental justice with more than a decade of experience. She is also the host of Hell or High Water: When Disaster Hits Home, a podcast from Vox Media and Audible Originals.More than 30 countries have pledged to pursue nuclear energy as one way to meet global climate goals. Even so, nuclear energy is still a controversial energy source thats bogged down by concerns about radioactive waste, safety, and high costs.At a nuclear energy summit in Brussels yesterday, the countries pledged to work to fully unlock the potential of nuclear energy by taking measures such as enabling conditions to support and competitively finance the lifetime extension of existing nuclear reactors, the construction of new nuclear power plants and the early deployment of advanced reactors, The Associated Press reports. The US, China, Japan, France, Britain, and Saudi Arabia were among the 34 countries to sign the pledge.Its a bold statement to support a source of energy over which many governments and environmental groups are deeply divided. Nuclear energy doesnt generate the greenhouse gas emissions heating up the planet, but the environmental footprint of its supply chain and waste creates other problems. And after decades of missteps, the technology still has to prove whether it can be an affordable, safe alternative to the fossil fuels causing climate change.Nearly every nation on Earth has committed to fighting climate change as part of the Paris agreement. That requires a transition from fossil fuels to clean energy over the next few decades. Fortunately, renewables like solar and wind energy are already cheaper than coal and gas and are forecast to make up a majority of new electricity sources deployed in coming years. The challenge is in finding backup energy sources for times when winds die down and the sun sets.Proponents of nuclear energy say its the perfect complement to renewables since nuclear reactors are able to generate electricity around the clock. Nuclear energy is indispensable along with renewable energy ... We must devise strategy to attract further investment which is necessary to enhance the use of nuclear energy, Japans Parliamentary Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs Komura Masahiro said during the Nuclear Energy Summit held yesterday by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).Its a remarkable turnaround from fears stoked more than a decade ago when an earthquake and tsunami triggered a catastrophic meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station in Japan. In December, Japan was one of more than 20 countries that agreed to triple renewable energy capacity globally by 2050. The country still plans to prioritize renewable energy, Masahiro said, and at the same time, Japan will continuously reflect upon the lessons from the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station and ensure that the use of nuclear power places safety as its top priority.Theres still skepticism over whether a nuclear renaissance is a good idea. Existing reactors and the radioactive waste they produce still pose risks. IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossihas tried to broker agreements between Russia and Ukraine to prevent a meltdown at Ukraines Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant amid the ongoing war. In the US, tribes and environmental advocates have fought to stop a resurgence of uranium mining that has a legacy of polluting water sources in the past.At the summit, John Podesta, US senior adviser to the president for clean energy innovation and implementation, touted the construction of the countrys first completely new power plant in decades. The Vogtle Unit 3 reactor in Georgia finally started operating last year, no less than $17 billion over budget after seven years of delays.Next-generation nuclear reactors are supposed to be easier and cheaper to build. But they havent overcome the radioactive waste problem. Theyll require more highly enriched uranium, of which Russia has been the largest supplier. And a key demonstration project using advanced small modular reactors in Utah was canceled in November after costs soared.All the evidence shows that nuclear power is too slow to build, too expensive, and it remains highly polluting and dangerous, Greenpeace EU senior campaigner Lorelei Limousinsaid. We are in a climate emergency, so time is precious, and the governments here today are wasting it with nuclear energy fairy tales.
Sunak will on Monday announce a national endeavour to secure the future of the nuclear submarine-building and nuclear energy industries, creating 40,000 jobs in the process, the prime ministers office said in a statement on Sunday.The government will also partner with industry players, including BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce, EDF and Babcock, to invest at least 763 million pounds ($962m) in skills, jobs and education by 2030, the statement said.The UKs nuclear submarine industry is also set to grow in the coming years following the formation of the AUKUS security pact, under which the UK and the United States are assisting Australia in acquiring nuclear-powered submarines.Thats why we are investing in Barrow, the home of UK submarines, and in the jobs and skills of the future in the thriving British nuclear industry. Today we usher in the next generation of our nuclear enterprise, which will keep us safe, keep our energy secure, and keep our bills down for good.
In an online video from Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation, a cartoon simulation shows a tsunami wiping out one of their future nuclear power stations and cutting off power. What happens next? Not much: The reactor quietly shuts itself down. It cools off just by sitting there, no moving parts or fluids, no operator actions, says the reassuring video. Weve designed a reactor that is inherently safe no matter the events.The Seattle-based Ultra Safe and dozens of other companies like it are at the forefront of a global nuclear energy revival. As the world urgently needs to wean itself off fossil fuels, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and get the planets temperature under control, policymakers, companies and researchers are reexamining nuclear energy as a green alternative that can help bolster the power produced by renewables like wind and solar. Today the industry is emerging from a period of stagnation, with a promise to double or triple its capacity by 2050.That revival is undergirded by two hot technology trends. Companies like Ultra Safe are aiming to build small modular reactors (SMRs) designed to be just a fraction of the size of former plants, to reduce both building costs and the scope of possible disasters. And many are aiming to utilize new technologies designed to make meltdown accidents impossible and to create less long-lived waste.But the surge in interest is not without controversy. As with everything in the nuclear landscape, debate rages about whether society actually needs nuclear to tackle climate change, and whether the new systems are as shiny as they seem  with reasonable arguments for and against every promise and risk. Some say the new technologies could offer a fantastic solution to our energy woes; others say nuclear is beset with so many environmental, social and economic problems that it is best abandoned in favor of other ways to meet the globes energy demands.The next few years will decide what course nuclear power takes in the worlds energy future. This is a moment of truth, says Francesca Giovannini, a nuclear policy expert at the Harvard Kennedy School. Over the next few decades, nuclear power is either going to make it, or that industry is fundamentally done for. ... Its 50/50 how this goes.Nuclear power poses some obvious risks  meltdown accidents, nuclear fuel being diverted to weapons programs, environmental issues posed by mining for uranium, the problems of storing nuclear waste. Against a backdrop of such concerns, alongside shifting economics of energy production, nuclear power production started to level off in the early 2000s and even dipped briefly after the Fukushima power plant accident of 2011. Some nations, most notably Germany, decided to shutter their nuclear programs entirely. But global nuclear power production is now starting to inch upward again.Today, nuclear plants produce about 10 percent of global electricity, making nuclear the second largest source of non-fossil-fuel energy after hydropower. There are about 440 nuclear power plants in operation globally; another 60 or so are now being built, and around 100 are on order or planned.Most Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios for keeping the world below 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming include some kind of increase in nuclear power capacity. In the International Energy Agencys (IEA) pathway to net zero, global nuclear power production doubles over 2022 levels by 2050. A key reason for this is that nuclear is seen as a good way to provide consistent baseload power to prop up more variable renewable sources of energy like wind or solar. Without nuclear, advocates say, we would need to build far more wind and solar power plants to ensure reliable supplies, doubling or tripling costs over power networks that include nuclear.Nuclear has plenty of advantages: It produces no carbon emissions (and, counterintuitively, releases less radioactive uranium and other elements into the environment than burning coal does). It takes up a lot less land than renewables, a not insignificant consideration. If the goal is to decarbonize quickly and with as little social pain as possible, nuclear is essential, says Kai Vetter, a nuclear physicist at the University of California, Berkeley.At the UNs Convention on Climate Change meeting in Dubai in December 2023, more than 20 nations signed a declaration to triple nuclear capacity by 2050. And cash is flowing into this effort. In 2020, the US Department of Energy (DOE) notably gave $160 million for two demonstration plants to get up and running by 2027. And in 2022, the European Union declared that some nuclear projects could call themselves green in the same way as renewables, opening the door to environmental financing mechanisms.But as with almost every issue relating to nuclear power, the arguments in favor of nuclear have their detractors. Public policy expert M.V. Ramana at the University of British Columbia is one of many, for example, who say that baseload power is an outdated concept. A smart, diverse and flexible electric grid, they argue, can assure a reliable power supply by shunting power among sources and storage facilities.Most scenarios for global net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 include a role for nuclear power. Here, projections from the International Energy Agency forecast that the total amount of power from nuclear will need to grow by 2050 to meet needs (left). But because the worlds total energy demand is expected to rise significantly, nuclears share of all power generation may actually fall (right).Then theres the question of safety. The grand total of lives lost from all nuclear power generation to date, while hard to quantify, is certainly far lower than the number of people killed by air pollution related to the burning of fossil fuels; a recent paper by NASA scientists concluded that nuclear power saved roughly 1.8 million lives from 1971 to 2009 thanks to avoided air pollution. By some accounts nuclear power has also proved less deadly than wind power, which has been linked to drownings at offshore wind farm sites and helicopter collisions with turbines.But fatality is arguably a blunt way to measure the impacts of the nuclear industry, which also include the risk of accidents contaminating large tracts of land, plus numerous other effects related to such things as mining and waste storage. Ramana has documented how the burden of these last issues falls disproportionately on Indigenous and disempowered communities, working against the goals of social justice. Nuclear power, he writes, does not fit with any idea of a responsible and cleaner energy system.If we are to pursue nuclear power at the scale called for by the IEA, it will take a herculean effort. The IEAs pathway requires the world to ramp up from building five big nuclear plants per year to 20 per year over the next decade. Big plants typically cost billions of dollars and come with big financial risks. Westinghouse Electric Company, for example, recently filed for bankruptcy in the face of billions of dollars of cost overruns during the construction of four nuclear plants in the United States.One plan for reducing those epic and prohibitive costs is to build small modular reactors, ranging from reactors that can be shipped on a truck and produce a couple of hundred megawatts, to tiny single-megawatt sizes that are more akin to hefty diesel generators. The modules could be pre-built in a factory and shipped to a site for installation. All this should make these reactors less frightening prospects for investors (though the end price per unit of electricity might wind up higher than that from a larger nuclear power plant).A handful of SMRs are already in operation in Russia, China and India. Dozens more are in development. Canada has a national SMR action plan, and as of 2021 there were 10 SMR proposals under review (including one from Ultra Safe).But so far, the promise of enticingly low costs for SMR builds hasnt materialized, says Granger Morgan, a physicist and codirector of the Center for Climate and Energy Decision Making at Carnegie Mellon. Morgan has crunched the numbers for nuclear in the US and was disappointed. I thought SMRs were going to hold much more promise, but we cant make the numbers wash, he says.That message was hammered home in November 2023 when the company NuScale scrapped its high-profile advanced plans to build an underground SMR in Idaho in the face of cost hikes. Would it be nice to have nuclear? Yes absolutely, says Morgan. Will it be affordable? Thats very much an open question.Others argue that small isnt always beautiful. While smaller plants present a smaller risk from smaller potential accidents, this strategy also means more plants overall, which means more facilities to protect against theft and terrorism. You have way more fissile material dispersed; you will have to secure way more infrastructure, says Giovannini. I mean, that becomes a mess.While some are focusing on making nuclear plants smaller, theres a parallel movement to make them safer and more efficient. The next generation of reactor designs  Generation IV, in the industrys lingo  includes a suite of six major reactor families, all very different from todays standard, each with many possible variants under development. Much of the attention (particularly in the US) has been focused on three of these: high-temperature gas-cooled, molten salt and sodium-cooled.The ideas behind these technologies, and even some early-stage power plants, have been around for decades. But the new variants of these old ideas combine novel fuels and designs, promising to be safer, more efficient and environmentally friendly. Theyre doing all kinds of whizz-bang, high-tech stuff, says Morgan, who has no doubt that newer reactors can be made safer than old ones.Most existing reactors are water-cooled uranium systems, which were chosen as the dominant technology largely as a quirk of history. Like all reactor types, they have their pros and cons. They need high pressures to stop their coolant waters from boiling off at typical operating temperatures around 300 degrees Celsius. And they are designed to work with relatively slow-moving neutrons  the subatomic particles that collide with nuclear fuel to initiate nuclear fission. Slow-moving neutrons are more likely to interact with fuel particles, but systems that use them are also limited in the kinds of fuels they can use. Catastrophe can strike if the fission reaction runs amok or the reactor gets too hot and the core melts down, as happened at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima, spewing radiation into the environment.Standard water-cooled reactor designs are vulnerable to catastrophic failures leading to explosions and the meltdown of the reactor core, as happened in 1986 to the Chernobyl reactor shown here. Newer designs may be less vulnerable to this type of unsafe meltdown, advocates say.The latest models of water-cooled reactors (sometimes called Gen III Plus, including many SMRs) use new design tricks to reduce the number of safety systems that require human intervention, aiming to stop accidents in their tracks automatically. Gen IV reactors, though, use entirely different coolant materials, are usually designed to operate at higher, more efficient temperatures, and often use faster-speed neutrons that can convert the most prevalent natural isotopes of uranium into usable fuel, or even feed on nuclear waste.High-temperature gas-cooled reactors, for example, run at temperatures up to 950C, making them 20 to 33 percent more thermally efficient than water-cooled reactors. Since the core materials used in these reactors are typically stable up to 1,600C, which is hotter than lava, theres a large margin of safety. The reactor in Ultra Safes video is an SMR that falls into this category; its small size helps, too, with passive cooling. Ultra Safe also makes their own fuel pellets, encased in a bespoke material that they say retains radioactive materials even in extreme conditions. Theyre hoping to build their first commercial micro-reactor in Canada.In molten salt reactors, both fuel and coolant are already liquid. So meltdowns, in the traditional sense, are impossible. And liquid-sodium-cooled reactors have a built-in safety feature: If they heat up, the liquid sodium expands and allows more neutrons to escape through the gaps between atoms, so the reaction (which is driven by neutrons) naturally winds down. The US Department of Energy has funded the US company TerraPower (which has Bill Gates as a major investor) to build a demonstration plant of its sodium-cooled Natrium reactor in Wyoming by 2030.Waste is one area where the new designs really see some significant improvements, says Giovannini. None of the reactors have entirely solved the problem of nuclear waste, but they do provide some significant solutions in terms of quantity, she says. The spent fuel from traditional light water reactors needs to be buried in special repositories for hundreds of thousands of years, because of the production of long-lived radioactive byproducts. Some Gen IV reactors, on the other hand, can transform spent fuel into more fissile isotopes and use it for further fission reactions. This can improve efficiency and produce waste that need only be stored for hundreds of years.Not everyone, though, thinks all these systems are as shiny as they seem. In 2021, the Union of Concerned Scientists published a report entitled Advanced Isnt Always Better, in which they highlighted issues with safety, sustainability and nuclear proliferation. They concluded that nearly all the Gen IV reactor types fail to provide significant enough improvements over [light water reactors] to justify their considerable risks.The report was criticized by some for being ideologically antinuclear, says Giovannini. But, she says, it was very fair to point out that new tech comes with new worries. Liquid salt, the report pointed out, is corrosive; liquid sodium metal can burst into flame when in contact with water or air. High-temperature gas-cooled reactors, the report concluded, while tolerant of high temperatures, are far from meltdown-proof, as some claim.Many of these Gen IV systems offer another key benefit: Their higher temperatures can provide not just electricity but also useful heat. This could be used in many industrial processes, such as the production of steel, cement and fertilizer, which currently burn a lot of fossil fuels in their furnaces.That heat is pretty much for free, says Vetter, who sees a particular utility for nuclear heat in desalination, getting clean drinking water out of saltwater as is done at the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant in California. Indeed, X-energy, a leading US Gen IV nuclear company funded by the DOE, has partnered with Dow chemical company to build its first high-temperature gas-cooled reactor at a Dow chemical production site by 2030. Morgan, though, thinks that most industries will balk at the set-up costs.Even if Gen IV reactors turn out to be technically superior, though, it may be decades before they can be thoroughly tested, passed by regulators and built at commercial scale. With little time to spare in the fight against climate change, the world might be better off simply ramping up old reactor designs that are already proven, says Esam Hussein, a retired nuclear engineer from the University of Regina, Canada. We have the operating experience, we have the regulatory framework, he says. If the goal is to fight climate change, why dont you go with the devil you know?In response to why we need a devil at all, many are quick to point out that no energy solution is problem-free, including renewables. Giovannini says she agrees with the nuclear industrys criticism that we have jumped on renewables in a very uncritical way. Wind and solar require electronics and battery banks to store their energy; these in turn need elements like lithium and cobalt that can come with environmental and social justice issues from mining. Nothing is 100 percent safe, says Vetter.It is hard for many to swallow data, assurances and statistics about nuclear, given its history and the huge amounts of money at stake. I think the nuclear industry is selling a bunch of bullshit most of the time, says Giovannini, who has been critical of how the industry deals with public concerns. But her own main worry about nuclear is theyre moving too slow. If companies like Ultra Safe, X-Energy, TerraPower and others are going to help fight climate change with Gen IV technologies and fleets of small reactors, she and others say, theyre going to have to ramp up fast.Editors note: This story was updated on March 20, 2024, to change a name: Granger Morgan was referred to as Granger instead of Morgan in one reference. It was updated on March 21, 2024, to correct the specialty of Esam Hussein. He is a retired nuclear engineer, not a retired nuclear physicist.Where will the United States store its nuclear waste? The revised nuclear waste regulatory system must address the entire fuel cycle and consider the different wastes from conventional and next-generation nuclear reactors.Thank you for your interest in republishing!

A next generation nuclear power plant from Bill Gates-founded TerraPower is set to begin construction in Kemmerer, Wyoming this June, according to the Financial Times, marking the start of a larger initiative from the company that aims to bring more affordable and efficient reactors to a competitive nuclear energy market.The demonstration plant will be home to TerraPowers Natrium nuclear reactor, which is cooled with liquid sodium as opposed to water and features a molten salt-based energy storage system, all of which makes for a safer, cheaper and more efficient energy machine that can be built for around half the cost of a water-cooled reactor.The reactor produces 345 megawatts and can have its output boosted to 500 megawatts for more than five-and-a-half hours if need be, which is the equivalent of the energy needed to power around 400,000 homes.TerraPower has secured up to $2 billion in pledges from the U.S. government to complete work on the plant and nearly $1 billion in private funding, in addition to reaching a deal with Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation to explore the exportation of TerraPowers Natrium reactors to the United Arab Emirates.The project is slated for completion in 2030, when it will become a full-scale commercial plant expected to generate 1,600 construction jobs and bring on 250 full-time employees to operate it in Kemmerer, which will receive power from the plant.Nuclear energy has gained increasing popularity as an alternative zero-emission energy source that could help mitigate waste, pollution and carbon footprints associated with fossil fuel sources. In terms of density, one uranium pellet is equal to 17,000 cubic feet of natural gas, 120 gallons of oil and one ton of coal, according to the Department of Energy. Gates founded TerraPower in 2008 with the goal of developing safe and cost-effective nuclear reactors that could fight climate change and meet energy needs. The company fundraised $830 million in 2022 and, in addition to other rivals like publicly traded nuclear energy company NuScale, became involved in a U.S. government push to develop, use and export small, cutting-edge nuclear reactors as a means of competing with Russias hold on the nuclear energy market and Chinas burgeoning nuclear industry.The U.S. government is looking to procure decades-long agreements with other countries for the exportation of small modular reactors, according to the Wall Street Journal, which added the U.S. nuclear reactor sales pitch centers around being a less risky partner than Moscow or Beijing. Its never good if our allies are dependent on a potential adversarial country for energy, Bret Kugelmass, chief executive of nuclear-power startup Last Energy, told the Journal.
Back in November, the US Department of State and the Slovak Ministry of Economy co-hosted the inaugural Project Phoenix Workshop and Launch Event in Bratislava. More than 15 countries from Europe and Eurasia region were there to discuss the goal of building out new nuclear energy capacity  specifically US small nuclear reactors (SMRs) in Eastern Europe and Eurasia.It is argued that these SMRs differ from larger reactors by requiring less fuel, offering more flexibility in location and having the ability to be prefabricated and shipped. Project Phoenix aims to deploy SMRs in Europe and Eurasia, thereby helping countries eventually turn completely away from Russian energy and nuclear know-how. But there are multiple problems with the US scheme. Here are just a few:Nevertheless, the US is pushing the narrative that the deployment of SMRs will help liberate countries from Putins designs for a neo-Soviet empire. The question confronting those Eastern European and Eurasian countries in attendance at the Project Phoenix event is exemplified by Armenia. It draws 40 percent of its energy from its Soviet-era Metsamor nuclear power plant, but has already been issued multiple lifetime extensions. Areg Danagoulian, an associate professor of Nuclear Science and Engineering at MIT, taps into the American narrative as he writes on the Armenian decision:Meanwhile the Armenian government has been busy exploring replacement alternatives, such as possibly US-built small modular reactors (SMRs), seen as a viable replacement. Armenian officials have also entered in discussions with Russia about the possibility of replacing the Soviet-era VVER-440 reactor with the much larger and more modern Russian VVER-1200 design. While the US option is not easymainly because of the lack of readiness of most SMR designsthe Russian option is particularly fraught. Armenia is reluctant to further increase its energy dependence on Russia, given Putins campaign of neo-Soviet expansionism. This is further exacerbated by the technical and economic difficulty of hosting a 1200-megawatt electric VVER-1200 unit on a grid that on average consumes only about 1,000 megawatts.This is a route that the US hopes many Eurasian countries choose, and theyll no doubt get the Europeans to eventually play along (the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia are slated to get the SMRs first  maybe by the mid 2030s), but lets look at the problems with this plan.NuScale Power Cooperation, the first company in the United States to secure approval for the design of a small modular nuclear reactor (SMR), ended its contract with the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS) on Wednesday. The companies cited rising costs as the reason for terminating the contract.Throughout the development process, NuScale made several ill-advised design choices in an attempt to control the cost of its reactor, but which raised numerous safety concerns. The design lacked leak-tight containment structures and highly reliable backup safety systems. It also only had one control room for 12 reactor units despite the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) typically requiring no more than two units per control room. Additionally, the company led efforts to sidestep critical safety regulations, including requirements for offsite emergency response plans to protect nearby communities. But NuScales justification for all this regulatory corner-cuttingthat the design is passively safewas undermined when concerns about its passive emergency core cooling system arose late in the design certification process.Respected thinkers such as former U.S. president Barack Obama, French president Emmanuel Macron, and Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates have toasted the idea of small modular reactors, or SMRs, as a potentially reliable, almost-emissions-free backup to intermittent renewable energy sources like wind and solar. Advocates claim that because SMRs will be smaller than the giants that currently dominate horizons, they will be safer, cheaper, and quicker to build. Although SMRs will have only a fraction of the power-generating capacity of traditional nuclear power reactors, proponents envision that they will, one day, be assembled in factories and transported as a unit to sites  like Sears mail-order Modern Homes of the early 1900sBut SMRs are just as likely to face similar delays and cost overruns. Currently, there are just two existing advanced SMR facilities in the world that could be reasonably described as SMRs: a pilot reactor in China and Russias diminutive Akademik Lomonosov. More small reactors are under construction in China, Russia, and Argentina, but all of them are proving even more expensive per kilowatt than traditional reactors.The US SMR companies rely heavily on subsidies to be economically competitive, and even that wasnt enough for NuScale, which secured $4 billion in federal tax subsidies.Similarly, Project Phoenix is being carried out in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Commerces Small Modular Reactor Public-Private Program, and will no doubt lean heavily on the public side of the ledger.Last year, the US Export-Import Bank and US International Development Finance Corporation issued letters of interest to invest up to $4 billion in Polands SMR development projects, and similar letters have also been offered for Romanian projects.Project Phoenix is partnering with the Three Seas Initiative (3SI)  a politically inspired, commercially driven platform for improving connectivity between thirteen EU Member States allocated between Baltic, Adriatic and Black seas. Led by the US, Germany, and the European Commission, 3SI has an investment fund advised by Amber Infrastructure Group, which promises an attractive return to the investors. The Three Seas Fund was created under Luxembourg law, which means its liable to a subscription tax of 0.01% of the funds net assets and is exempted from the payment of the capital gains tax, income tax, and wealth tax.Started in 2019, 3SI has made a lot of investments, but little actual infrastructure has been built, none of which is a SMR. Involved parties continue to iron out ultimate return on investment calculation.Nearly 50 percent of the worlds uranium enrichment is done by the Russian nuclear energy firm Rosatom, whose subsidiary Tenex is the only company in the world commercially selling Haleu  a high-assay low-enriched uranium that could be a key fuel source for SMRs. More from OilPrice:Firstly, Rosatom is a major exporter of nuclear fuel, providing the U.S. with 14 percent of its uranium in 2021. Meanwhile, utilities across Europe purchased around a fifth of their uranium from Rosatom, and they have been unable to diversify their uranium sources since cutting other energy ties with Russia. Rosatom also provided 28 percent of the U.S.s enrichment services in 2021.Further, Rosatom is not just limited to Russia, holding ownership of several nuclear plants around the world. By the end of 2021, one in five nuclear plants worldwide was either in Russia or was Russian-built. Rosatom has repeatedly stepped in to help finance nuclear plants in countries that want to expand their nuclear power sectors but dont have the money to do so. Many of these plants fall under a build-own-operate model, relying on Rosatom for their operation.The EU, despite 13 sanction packages against Russia, has yet to target its nuclear industry. And according to Euratom Supply Agency, the EU increased imports from Russia of nuclear fuel and services for the blocs Russian-designed reactors again in 2023 compared to 2021. Five countries  Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary and Slovakia  bought 30 percent more conversion services from Russia and 22 percent more enrichment. Even RFE/RL admits the challenges for the US:Westinghouse, an U.S. nuclear power company, is already seeking ways to offer alternative fuel in Europe, but it will take some time to get all the licenses and approvals. In addition, there are concerns that fuel from the United States might be more expensive, and it is unclear how Westinghouse would handle the waste-management system.Nonetheless, Germany, which worsened its energy predicament last year by shutting down its remaining six nuclear power plants, continues to push for EU countries to end their relationship with Russias nuclear industry. If this sounds familiar to the rejection of Russian pipeline natural gas in favor of US LNG, well, it is. And the same players are pushing the envelope. Heres Robert Habeck, the German economy and climate minister:Across the EU, we must keep making ourselves independent from Russia. Habeck added, The nuclear sector is still outstanding. It is not justifiable that this area is still given preferential treatment. Nuclear technology is an extremely sensitive area, and Russia can no longer be seen as reliable partner within it.The only option European countries who rely on Russia for nuclear fuel would be to shutter their plants like Germany did, because despite US-led programs like Project Phoenix and the Three Seas Initiative, theres no one else prepared to step in and fill Russias role for conversion services and enrichment.And even if the US is able to convince European countries and a few Eurasian ones to go with its SMR technology, the only supplier able to provide the fuel on a commercial scale is Russias Tenex. Despite all the money the US is throwing around, little progress is being made, and the reliance on Russia is even causing delays for a company founded by one of the worlds richest individuals:[Bill] Gates has gone so far as to invest a chunk of his fortune in a firm he founded, TerraPower, a leading nuclear innovation company. Gatess TerraPower has an even longer way to go, although it too is cashing in on subsidies. The U.S. Department of Energy has pledged up to $2 billion in matching funds to construct a demonstration plant in Wyoming. Yet TerraPower recently announced its facing delays of at least two years because of difficulties securing uranium fuel from its lone supplier: Russia.The Senates recent border and Ukraine spending package contained more than $2 billion in funds for uranium processing as the Biden administration is gravely concerned about Russias dominance in the field. It seems a little late in the game to be waking to this reality, but thats where the US is. US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm is now calling on Congress to ban uranium supplies from Russia and throw more money at domestic enrichment, but estimates are that it would take at least five years of heavy investment for the US to end its dependence on Russian imports of enriched uranium.Meanwhile, the US imported $1.2 billion worth of Russian uranium last year  an all-time high. Russia is also considered the world leader when it comes to the export of nuclear plant development. It can not only build a plant and provide the fuel, but it often trains local specialists, deals with safety questions, and disposes of the waste. It has recently built or is building reactors in Trkiye, Egypt, Argentina, and has been making a major push into Africa. Rosatom is constructing a Center of Nuclear Science and Technologies in Rwanda, and Ethiopia, Nigeria and Zambia have signed similar deals with Rosatom. Countries such as Ghana, Uganda, Sudan and DRC also have cooperation agreements with Rosatom. There are at least 50 countries that have some level of nuclear cooperation with Russia.The case of Turkiye is illustrative. Ankara had been trying to get a nuclear power plant built for 50 years before signing a deal with Russia in 2010 to build the Akkuyu plant in Turkiye. Back in the 1990s Ankara had bids from Westinghouse + Mitsubishi, AECL, and Framatome + Siemens but had to cancel because it was going to cost more than the Turkish government could afford at the time.Trkiye eventually pivoted to Russias build-own-operate model because it was an arrangement Ankara could afford. Under this arrangement, Russia financed, built, and is delivering the fuel to Akkuyu, which began operations last year. Russia will also handle the waste. For the moment Rosatom owns 75 percent of the shares in the plant, although it reserves the right to sell a project share of not more than 49% to other investors, thus keeping the controlling interest of 51 percent.Trkiyewill buy a fixed proportion of the power at a fixed price of 12.35 /kWh for 15 years. The proportion will be 70 percent of the output of the first two units and 30 percent of that from units 3 and 4 over 15 years. The remainder of the power will be sold by the project company on the open market. After 15 years, when the plant is expected to be paid off, the project company will pay 20 percent of the profits to the Turkish government.Turkish nuclear engineers are also receiving training from the Russians. As the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists says: Given the costs for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the plant, as well as for the management and transport of the waste, this was considered an economically well-negotiated agreement by nuclear energy policy experts. In short, it was a good deal for Turkey.If the US gets its SMR designs ironed out, and really wants to move forward with deploying the reactors, there is another country with a big (and rapidly growing ) presence in nuclear conversion and enrichment (assuming the US doesnt do it itself) that could possibly help the West replace Russian services. Theres another problem there, however. China is also on the enemy list.In current news, the French new generation EPR in Flamanville is incurring yet another delay (albeit very small compared to previous ones), and will not be connected to the electrical network and start producing energy before mid-2024.As an example, France (which has its own enrichment facilities) only performs a first re-processing step with spent fuel, extracting plutonium for its atomic arsenal. The resulting depleted uranium is sent to Rosatom, which transforms it into fuel for nuclear reactors  and stores away the highly-depleted uranium and nasty nucleides that cannot be turned into anything useful for the atomic energy industry.Itll depend. See my comment below. In the cases of some of these SMR technologies  e.g. TerraPower and Oklo  the point of them is that theyre fast breeder reactors, and the Oklo technology only runs on and will recycle used fuel.Basically what is going on across everything. All the dirty industries were exported to Russia and China in order to avoid the environmentalists and the unions demanding changes (or downright closure) that would cut into corporate, and thus stockholder, earnings. Thing is though that said industries are the backbone of the rest of the economy, providing the raw materials and energy for producing all those widgets that keep the masses entertained and docile.In France, the point has been raised that, should the government cancel the contract with Rosatom, then France might have to ready itself for receiving, warehousing, and managing that whole unusable pile of highly-depleted uranium and nasty nucleides resulting from the re-processing of spent fuel from French power plants, but which is for now stored away in Siberia (together with the similar piles from other countries).That bit about NuScale developing a small modular nuclear reactor while cutting every corner that they could was scary stuff. Did they think that the government would just give them a waiver on all this stuff? They were literally building the next Three Mile Island nuclear power plant. And yet they thought that they could get away with it but at least Utah was smart enough to bail. But maybe NuScale Power Cooperations real aim was to just bring in investors and work out how to build those reactors later. Wouldnt be the first time something like that happened.But what gets me is this. You could take Conors excellent post here and use it as a briefing document. Show those in charge that no matter how much they wish to get rid of Russia, it is not going to happen. The world is far too reliant on their expertise and knowledge as they never exported this industrial know-how. And yet all those world leaders just go on pretending that they can get their way by just wishing it. In a better world they would acknowledge the situation and just move on but instead they want all these wild schemes. Maybe we need less lawyers in government and more engineers and no, software engineers do not count. The Chinese leadership has lots of engineers in their ranks and it shows.Rolls-Royces SMR technology (a relatively conventional three-loop pressurized water reactor) is radically different from Gatess TerraPower (a fast reactor where a small enriched fuel core breeds Plutonium-239 in a larger mass of non-fissile but fertile depleted uranium); which is different yet again from Oklo Inc. (a fast micro-reactor running on so-called nuclear waste, or partially used fuel).At the nuclear ages birth there may have been a thousand-plus different designs and directions possible, according to Alvin Weinberg (responsible for the standard Boiling Water Reactor design and the molten-salt reactor). The nuclear plants designs we  got resulted in large measure from nation-states bomb-building programs (see forex Vaos description above of France very limited recycling to extract plutonium for bombs) and, in the US, the prioritization of commercial corporations making profits, which drove the move to a once-through fuel cycle and the introduction of the pernicious concept of nuclear waste.One benefit of global economy is that allows specialization. Reaching the top in a technological field may be simple following a genius, or gradual process of accumulating designs and experience that can loose value if you interrupt activity for, say, ten years and the experts retire or go to other fields. In the second case, the cost of entering the market, or re-entering can be beyond capability of finance dependent private companies.Observing from orbit, it is wasteful to duplicate such efforts. Down on Earth, it is not competitive. Thus key steps in micro-chip production require products of two companies, one Dutch, one German. Russia, a minor miner of titanium, produces the best titanium for aerospace. Japan has best niobium technologies. I guess a long list can be compiled, and quite a few leaders are in USA, but Russia and China have their specialties too. This is the product of globalization after the fall of Soviet Union, as countries could rely on products from anywhere.Difficulties of staying on top are also present in military technologies. For example, Russia had huge problems with drone program that was promising breakthroughs since at least 2015. When it begun to be critical for an actual war, Russia had to exchange key technologies with Iran, to military benefit of both. In the case of peaceful atom, the West somehow dropped the ball, in part of anti-nuclear sentiment in a number of key countries. Back in the day, I thought that France, Japan and Korea will sufficiently preserve their programs, but that does not seem to be the case.Nuclear power is a particularly tough case. I follow news from RosAtom videos, practicing my Russian in the process, so I know some principles they claim. One is to use prototype(s) for 6 years domestically before offering it for export, so development cycle is long, idea, lab testing, then construction, then real life testing, 15 years seems to be minimum. At it does not have to work! RosAtom has a steady stream of military orders, and a national priority  one of the concepts for post-oil Russia. Chinese nuclear program has similarly deep pockets. But the West has several somewhat sketchy programs. Canada promises to test small nuclear power in its Arctic, perhaps it will work. Or not.One can have many conclusions, but one is that the current Western effort of splitting the globe again into blocks that sanction each other to the hilt is dangerous in extreme. It aims to maintain Western monopoly on state of the art in key technology, thus dominating other blocks, preferably broken into individual countries. It will surely delay the transition away from fossil fuels, on top of relatively minor risks like thermonuclear war (the former will surely happen, the latter one can hope will not).If the objective is to produce the most energy for the least inputs (not just fuel, but also all the metals, concrete, and synthetic materials needed for the plant itself), then I do not see the point of SMR  apart from niche applications that is (e.g. those Russian atomic ice-breakers). Which ultimately undermines the economies derived from mass-production.He makes the point that at a new installation with say 8 x 300MW units the first is more per watt than a AP1000. But each successive unit gets faster and labor/time is a huge cost factor and it ends up being faster and less expensive than the larger ones.Bigger may mot be cheaper, but the cumulative effect of building the same thing multiple times for an equivalent output is that inevitably much more duplication of physical material is required  contrary to what you assert. Some things just cant be made any smaller, also duplication of many components at a smaller scale will almost always lead to more material being used than in making one large component. Economy of scale is almost a physical law, and a huge amount of effort would be required to overcome this.In his 2014 book The Colder War, Marin Katusa described in detail RUs primacy in the nuclear energy sector. The wests political leadership wasnt paying attention, and nowten years onthere are still no easy or quick solutions at hand.Changjiang  After a three-hour drive from Sanya, Global Times reporters, along with approximately 200 officials and scholars, arrived at the Changjiang Nuclear Power Plant in South Chinas Hainan Province on Tuesday morning. This facility is the base for the Linglong-1  the worlds first commercial onshore small modular reactor (SMR) to begin construction and pass the IAEA general safety review.Many foreign representatives from the nuclear power industry, particularly from countries keen to introduce nuclear energy, eagerly anticipate this tour. They hope to learn more about this significant example of nuclear energy innovation and evaluate if the Linglong-1 might be a suitable choice for them.Donning long-sleeve shirts, pants, smash-proof shoes, and safety helmets, visitors were ushered to the construction site in groups. Safety warning signs were prominently displayed throughout the site, underscoring the importance of safety during construction.The entire project is slated to commence the installation phase by the end of 2023. With safety and quality thoroughly monitored, the project is set to transition to the debugging stage in the second half of 2024, according to Qu Yong, the deputy-chief-engineer of Hainan Nuclear Power. Earlier in August, the core module was installed within the reactor building of the Linglong-1, also known as ACP100.Im astounded by the organization and efficiency of the project. The project duration is remarkably short! exclaimed Khammar Mrabit, the Director-General of Moroccos Agency for Nuclear and Radiation Safety and Security, after touring the site.Mrabit told the Global Times that China has made significant strides in large, medium, and small nuclear reactors. The ACP100 is definitely an option for Morocco. Were addressing legal and technical challenges to incorporate nuclear energy into our energy mix. Final decisions are still pending.Actually, the ACP100 is quite impressive. Kenya is contemplating establishing a power plant, and SMRs like the ACP100 are among our considerations due to their compact design, shared Collins Owino, an engineer from Kenyas Nuclear Power and Energy Agency, at the construction siteThe worlds first fourth-generation nuclear power plant, Huaneng Shandong Shidao Bay Nuclear Power Plant in eastern Chinas Shandong Province, went into commercial operation on December 6, 2023 and has been running well, according to officials at the plant.The power plant has drawn global attention as it adopts High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor-Pebble-bed Module (HTR-PM), which is claimed to be able to steer away from a meltdown or leak of radioactive materials even in extreme conditions.In the past few weeks of its commercial use, our two reactors in the power unit have maintained the initial full power stable operation. They generate electricity every day with the power of 150 megawatts, said Zhang Yijin, a chief operator at the power plant.I remember a documentary made/seen some decades ago about the birth of ISS. Prior to the fall of USSR, USUK et co have tried to build a space station and after years of trials and boatloads of money (~ 10 bil?) they came up with a small scal model.I worked on the back end of the nuclear fuel process, dealing with spent medium and high waste, and it is clear that without the massive subsidies, nuclear power would cost at least 10 times that of the next most expensive alternative. (Full costing, including disposal)

General Director of Energy, Hydrocarbons, and Mines of El Salvador Daniel Alvarez announced Friday evening on social media that El Salvador had signed the corresponding initial agreements with the IAEA for the peaceful use of nuclear energy.Our task and goal is to decarbonize the energy matrix and boost our countrys development, Alvarezs message read. The use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes is an important starting point and a turning point for our energy sector.Alvarez and Vice Foreign Minister Adriana Mira delivered El Salvadors request documentation to the IAEA during a visit to the agencys headquarters in Vienna, Austria. According to a statement from the Salvadoran Foreign Ministry, IAEA Director Rafael Mariano Grossi asserted that El Salvador is committed to decarbonization, diversifying its energy matrix.The documentation that El Salvador submitted reportedly included the Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the IAEA, the signing of a Convention on Nuclear Safety, and the signing of the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage.El Salvador is committed to decarbonization, diversifying its energy mix and benefitting from peaceful nuclear applications. Important to receive legal instruments from  Deputy FM @AdrianaMiraSV and @DGEHMSVs @daalvarezc, enabling nuclears safe and secure use. pic.twitter.com/eQhq1iEYWIOur country is developing in all areas, and energy is one of them. We are not only growing, but we are also doing so in a sustainable way through the diversification of energy sources, Mira wrote on social media.With this initiative, the Government of El Salvador is taking another step towards changing the energy matrix to improve the quality of life of Salvadorans, a statement from the Salvadoran Communications Secretary reportedly read.According to information thatEl Salvadors energy directorate published, 42.4 percent of the nations electricity comes from non-renewable resources, such as liquified gas and crude oil. The rest comes from renewable sources, such as hydroelectric and geothermal power plants, wind turbines, and biomass.Before the recent IAEA application, El Salvador and the Thorium Energy Alliance signed a memorandum of understanding on March 14 for the development of thorium-powered reactors and thermal energy storage systems.El Salvador reportedly increased its energy exports by 86 percent during 2023, amounting to $74.6 million worth of electric power exported to the region, becoming the first supplier of the resource in the Central American market, followed by Panama, Costa Rica, Honduras, and Nicaragua.

(Photo by MARTIN BERNETTI/AFP via Getty Images)The world is in sorry shape economically. Its heresy to say it, but one exceedingly productive move that would make the global economy great again would be to take a chainsaw to the immensely wasteful spending on so-called renewables, primarily windmills and solar panels. This would free up money for productive investment to fuel desperately needed economic growth.Post-Covid economies should be surging; instead, most are treading water or sinking. Developing countries are languishing. China says it will expand 5% in 2024, but no one believes Beijings numbers anymore, not with the huge unemployment among young people and a still-troubled property market, once a major engine of growth.President Joe Biden boasts that the U.S. has the best economy in the world, but our performance is substandard by historic standards and unhealthily buttressed by big government spending. Amazingly, given the strange way we calculate GDP, government spending directly boosts it: The more checks Uncle Sam sends out, the higher the GDP number. Washington will shovel out about $7 trillion this financial year, and Biden wants to spend even more next year. These annual outlays exceed the supposed temporary highs during the worst of the Covid crisis. In other words, our subpar performance rests on a destructive, antiproductive investment platform.Countries are drowning in debt. Total debt worldwide is $300 trillion, almost three times the size of the global economy. Slashing spending on alternative energy sources would set loose enormous sums of money to get economies expanding again. This is particularly crucial for poorer nations facing politically toxic stagnation.Renewables are supposed to save the planet by eliminating carbon dioxide emissions. But more and more evidence points to the fact that the massive amounts of minerals needed for such a switch and other environmentally damaging steps in the process end up, at best, a draw with fossil fuels. In other words, were wasting unimaginable amounts of money for nothing.Consider this: In this century, weve spent almost $6 trillion on renewables, and the share of energy worldwide coming from fossil fuels has declined from 86% to only 84%. If all these resources had instead gone into producing new businesses, expanding existing ones, creating new life-enhancing technologies and ensuring safe water for everyone, imagine how much better off the world would be. Or ponder this: Incredibly, Europes carbon dioxide emissions peaked in 1979; those of the U.S. peaked in 2005.There are two surefire clean sources of energy: natural gas and nuclear power. Yet the Biden Administration is throttling the output of natural gas, even though the U.S. is loaded with it. Simultaneously, regulators are stifling exciting advances in nuclear energy, most specifically small modular reactors (SMRs), which are much easier to construct and save considerable time and cost. SMRs can supply power to compact areas like towns, campuses, hospitals and data centers. But government regulations are smothering SMRs by adding immense and unnecessary expenses and delays.

How long must families wait? Its been nearly two months since the House passed a bipartisan expansion of the Child Tax Credit and sent it to the Senate. Estimates are that this bill will benefit 16 million children in families with low incomes, including 5.8 million kids under the age of six.You would think that in an election year, Congress would be eager to pass a tax cut for families (and small businesses). But a few senators are blocking it for political gain. Families should not have to wait months for Congress to pass something that is both popular and necessary.Yet, as millions upon millions cross our borders, the consequences of their plan is placing our people, and our nation, in grave danger. Contained within them are serious criminals and terrorists who want to destroy our country. We are also accepting the deaths of over 100,000 per year of our people from fentanyl.The recent release of Apple TVs ten-part documentary on the New England Patriots success was more an issue with team owner Robert Kraft finding fault with Coach Bill Belichick and blaming him for the team not returning to the Super Bowl in recent years.Coach Belichick took the Patriots to seven Super Bowls winning six, a feat that may never be achieved by another National Football League team but Kraft takes the low road with his anti-Belichick post-dynasty blame game. He deflects the blame for the recent seasons downturn onto anyone but himself as the owner.Our government is willing to pour money into unreliable solar and wind energy. Can you spell Solyndra? Nuclear energy is clean, safe and reliable. The hysteria that swirls around nuclear power is misguided. The technology required to build small, efficient, nuclear plants exists now. Nuclear energy needs to be a larger source of power for Americas growth. Government subsidies that are propping up solar and wind power are making some people rich but does not provide enough energy to make the US energy independent. Nuclear energy is a viable alternative to fossil fuel and should be a growing industry.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will set out plans to boost Britain's nuclear workforce on Monday, as increased submarine building and the growing needs of the nuclear energy industry are forecast to create 40,000 new jobs by 2030.The government will partner with defense companies BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce and Babcock plus energy giant EDF to invest more than 763 million pounds ($961 million) by the end of the decade in skills, jobs and education, it said in a statement.The government needs to ensure there are sufficient nuclear workers to help build and maintain its fleet of submarines, vital for defense and security as they are the basis of the UK's continuous at-sea nuclear deterrent."Safeguarding the future of our nuclear deterrent and nuclear energy industry is a critical national endeavor," said Sunak, who will on Monday visit Barrow-in-Furness in the northwest, where Britain's nuclear submarine industry is based.Further details on how Britain will deliver the capabilities necessary for to maintain its nuclear deterrent will be published by defense secretary Grant Shapps on Monday in the "Defencse Nuclear Enterprise Command Paper", Sunak's office said.As part of it plans to boost the nuclear workforce, the government said it will invest 200 million pounds in Barrow over the next decade to help support people into jobs, improve the area's transport infrastructure and build more homes.

I don't know how you solve this problem, but the residents are right to be skeptical when someone in authority tell them everything is OK.Is that actually the IAEA's job, though? Randomly, constantly, and uninvitedly Inspecting and analyzing each and every of the world's 440-something power plants' internals to the point where they can find flaws in structural features like the one that led to the Fukushima disaster?The need to wear mask and protective gear in an area were hazzarous material is being handeled does not necesary mean that the resulting product (in this specific case, water with residual Tritium) is harmful.Just thinking by 5 seconds, you sould understand that despite being in a radioactive hazzard area, the "protective gear" is minimum... just protective glasses, a mask and pair of cloath globes. The other  items like a helmet and the blue garment are more for general head protection and identification.The need to wear mask and protective gear in an area were hazzarous material is being handeled does not necesary mean that the resulting product (in this specific case, water with residual Tritium) is harmful.Grossi last visited the plant in July after issuing an IAEA review predicting only negligible impact from the discharges. An IAEA comprehensive report later concluded that the discharges meet international safety standards.Grossi last visited the plant in July after issuing an IAEA review predicting only negligible impact from the discharges. An IAEA comprehensive report later concluded that the discharges meet international safety standards.As in the previous rounds, Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc. will discharge 7,800 tons of treated water over about 17 days, having confirmed that the radioactivity level of the latest batch of water meets the standards set by the government and the utility.https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2024/02/7b89da33fd65-4th-release-of-fukushima-treated-radioactive-water-begins.html#:~:text=The%20operator%20of%20the%20crippled,the%20fiscal%20year%20ending%20March.From this round on, the operator will forgo the step of temporarily storing the treated water in a large tank to check the tritium level before release. It will check the level as the water flows through pipes, as it did in the past three rounds.Japanese authorities betrayed formal agreement with fisher people, disregarded option that can avoid dumping treated but still contaminated water, ignored that many kinds of radioactivity contain after even filtering, and escaped to consider about bioconcentration risk.Good to see this reassurance, showing the validity of the plan, and Japan's transparency. It still won't be enough to stop China's seafood ban, though, as we all know that's 100% politics and 0% science.
On March 25 and 26, Russias resort city of Sochi hosts the 13th international ATOMEXPO exhibition and forum. The event is focused on the expansion of advanced nuclear technologies in Russia and worldwide in a bid to boost energy independence, achieve a sustainable and safe environment, and secure high living standards.Russia, one of the worlds largest nuclear energy producers, has long been known for its outstanding experience in the atomic industry and currently dominates the global nuclear supply chain. It has a fleet of 36 reactors, and 19 reactors operating overseas  the largest number globally and, despite growing pressure from the EU and the US, it maintains a strong global influence in nuclear power. Many countries rely on atomic know-how from Russia to run their power plants.In 14 years, ATOMEXPO has transformed itself from a Russian nuclear industry event with occasional participation from foreign partners into a global nuclear industry discussion platform. The forum is designed to promote the nuclear industry and provide business opportunities for domestic and international companies.This years forum will be record-breaking both in terms of the total number of countries participating in ATOMEXPO  nearly 80, and in terms of newcomer countries  about 10. Were also going to see record figures in the number of ministers and foreign companies taking part in the event, said Aleksey Likhachev, the head of Russias atomic energy agency, Rosatom.The agenda of the ATOMEXPO 2024 includes global issues such as carbon-free energy, responsible approaches to the environment and natural resources, green investments, and international partnership for sustainable development. It has attracted more than 4,500 delegates and guests, bringing together executives from major Russian and international companies in the sector, government agencies, research and scientific organizations, and prominent nuclear industry experts.Special guests and participants include deputy director general and head of the Department of Nuclear Energy at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Mikhail Chudakov; Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto; Burundis Minister of Hydraulics, Energy and Mines Ibrahim Uwizeye; and Serbian Health Minister Danica Grujicic. The forum will host 40 round-table events and business sessions.ATOMEXPO features a plenary session dedicated to clean energy prospects, highlighting the importance of nuclear power in decarbonizing the worlds energy sector. As the biggest low-carbon source of electricity, nuclear energy is widely seen as a possible solution to global energy challenges and a path to overcoming the climate crisis.The rapid development of renewable power and its increase in the energy mix of countries worldwide creates new opportunities for the energy industry. Nuclear and hydropower generation provides a sustainable low-carbon power production ensuring energy security and safety. Its also cheaper than conventional sources of energy such as oil and gas.Nuclear technology continues to advance with fourth-generation nuclear reactors that could dramatically change the entire energy industry, mainly due to their safety and a significant reduction of radioactive waste.Fourth-generation nuclear technology refers to a new class of advanced reactors called small modular reactors (SMRs). They are designed to be safer, more efficient, and more sustainable than previous generations.In January, Russia announced the start of a landmark construction of the worlds first new generation-IV lead-cooled fast reactor of closed nuclear fuel cycle technology at the site of the Siberian Chemical Combine in Seversk, southwest Siberia. A closed nuclear fuel cycle means spent fuel is reprocessed and partly reused.Green hydrogen will also feature at ATOMEXPO. Generated from renewable energies, hydrogen has emerged as one of the strongest candidates for helping to decarbonize economic sectors dependent on emissions-intensive fossil fuels, including oil, gas and coal, taking the world a step closer to carbon neutrality. Its potential for many different uses makes green hydrogen a highly promising alternative for sectors where direct electrification or other low-carbon options might not be technically or economically feasible, for example in the steelmaking, chemical and refinery industries, and heavy transportation by land, air and sea.There is growing demand for lithium worldwide since it is used to make lithium-ion batteries, vital for most consumer electronics, as well as electric vehicles (EV). High demand for lithium is largely driven by the rapid development of electric cars. Following the exodus of European, American, and Japanese car manufacturers, Russia has embarked on the major development of its domestic automobile industry, focusing on EVs as they have fewer parts and are easier to produce. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov said last year that Russias lithium reserves and processing capacity would cover domestic and export demand by 2030.
Shortly after the magnitude-9 earthquake struck on March 11, a series of tsunamis inundated four of the reactor buildings and set off a chain reaction in three reactors that resulted in the release of significant amounts of radioactivity into the environment.The challenge in recent years has been to gather the large amounts of nuclear fuel that escaped from the reactors in order to halt the release of more radiation something that had never been attempted before and has to be carried out in buildings where radioactive contamination remains dangerously elevated and where debris from the tsunami and subsequent hydrogen explosions still litters the area.Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO), the operator of the plant, has estimated that work to make the plant safe will take between 30 and 40 years, but recent reports on progress at the site have been largely negative.In January, TEPCO announced that it would have to delay plans to commence in March the test use of a robotic arm to remove radioactive material from the No. 2 reactor. The initial plan called for tests using the robotic limb to take place in 2021 but were delayed by technical glitches.Other areas of the project have also experienced challenges, with the first drones and a robot sent into the No. 1 reactor building earlier this month also suffering faults. The drones and robothad to be withdrawn before they could complete their mission to locate molten fuel debris that has leaked from the reactor and to map other damage."Based on the roadmap and the Nuclear Regulation Authority's 'Risk Map,'the decommissioning steps to be taken over the next 10 years have been compiled in the mid-and-long term decommissioning action plan, which is periodically revised in light of decommissioning progress and the emergence of new issues that need to be addressed,"TEPCO said.The company is also keen to point out its achievements, including the complete removal of spent nuclear fuel from units three and four at the site, a sharp reduction in the amount of water seeping into the chambers beneath the reactors and becoming contaminated with radiation as well as the successful treatment of radioactive water below according to standards set by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) before it is released into the Pacific Ocean.Vincent Gorgues, the chief of staff to the French High Commissioner for Nuclear Energy and presently one of three international special advisors to Japan's Nuclear Damage Compensation and Decommissioning Facilitation Corp, told DW that progress to date has been overwhelmingly positive, despite the countless challenges."Nuclear projects are complex,"he said. "Among them, decommissioning projects are highly singular and offer a higher level of difficulty, due mainly to the level of uncertainty about the initial state of the facility and to difficulties in managing safely all the radioactive waste streams.""Even today, access to the reactor buildings is very difficult and requires fully remotely operated means of intervention, while carrying out investigations and having a precise idea of what needs to be done, even before considering how to do it, is a huge challenge in itself,"Gorgues said.In addition, each of the three crippled reactors has its own set of specific challenges and there is no disposal site for the highly radioactive nuclear waste that must be recovered from the site, he pointed out.The key steps now are to remove all the spent nuclear fuel, whether intact or leaked, from inside reactor buildings one and two, and the retrieval and disposal of fuel debris from the partial core meltdowns.Gorgues said he favors speeding up the release of treated water from the plant in order to dismantle the hundreds of storage tanks that presently occupy much of the site, with that land needed for new waste treatment and storage facilities.The expert also played down suggestions that TEPCO would likely not be able to stick to its declared timeline for the decommissioning process, emphasizing that the three- or four-decade schedule is "a target"rather than a deadline."This is not a race, but a structured, careful,stepwise approach, which at every stage requires you to take time, determine the best strategy and guarantee both short-term and long-term safety,"Gorgues said, adding that the radiological conditions "are extremely hostile.""This indicative timeframe of 30 to 40 years had two communication goals: to show that it would take a long time; but also to show that the timeframe would remain commensurable with one professional career and that the burden would not be passed on over several generations. It is in that spirit that we must consider this target.""I would like to stress, however, that these delays have remained minor and that most of what was announced has been achieved,"he said. "In my opinion, and under these conditions, what has already been done is a remarkable achievement."
The plant is located on the Dnipro River in eastern Ukraine and Ukrainian forces occupy the bank opposite, leaving it "in the sights of both sides' militaries", said The Guardian. Ukraine and Russia have blamed each other for shelling that has downed power lines."Captured by the Russian invaders" in the early stages of the war in March 2022, the "vast" Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant has been "on the frontline of the war ever since", added the paper. All six of its reactors are shut down, but it still needs "constant power" to keep fuel in those reactors cool and prevent a "potentially catastrophic meltdown", said Reuters.Russia initially wanted to connect the reactors to its own energy grid but that plan was abandoned, said The Guardian. "But recent comments from officials have suggested a new attempt to restart nuclear energy generation may take place later this year."In December, Yuriy Chernichuk, the Russian-appointed director of the site, told the plant's staff newsletter that 2024 is an "anniversary year for the station and the station is determined to work at full capacity".But Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), warned that "any such action would require a number of considerations", including that it is "an active combat zone" and that "this plant has been in shutdown for a prolonged period of time", said The Straits Times.Shaun Burnie, a nuclear specialist with Greenpeace Germany, said that "no nuclear regulations exist anywhere in the world that permit a nuclear plant to operate on the frontline in an active war zone".The pressure group also said that there was concern over whether Rosatom, the Russian state-owned energy provider now running the plant, could ensure there was enough cooling water available to safely operate even a single reactor.In the IAEA's fourth resolution condemning Russia's actions against Ukrainian nuclear facilities, it called for the "urgent withdrawal of all unauthorized military and other unauthorized personnel" and for the plant to be "immediately returned to the full control of the competent Ukrainian authorities".There are no signs of Russia adhering to the request, but in a meeting with Grossi earlier this month, Putin did acknowledge that "it is very important, on a planetary scale" to ensure "nuclear energy safety and compliance with safety standards throughout the world". The talks between the two men were described as "tense" by the RIA Novosti news agency, but a spokesperson for the IAEA denied the description.Greenpeace accused Grossi of complacency, and insisted restarting any of the reactors should be comprehensively ruled out. The IAEA "must not play the role of pretend regulator" in "overseeing a Russian nuclear timebomb", said a spokesperson, but instead "must make clear that safe operation is impossible".Chas Newkey-Burden has been part of The Week Digital team for more than a decade and a journalist for 25 years, starting out on the irreverent football weekly 90 Minutes, before moving to lifestyle magazines Loaded and Attitude.

Holtec International acquired the 800-megawatt Palisades plant in 2022 with plans to dismantle it. But now the emphasis is on restarting it by late 2025, following support from the state of Michigan and the Biden administration.Governor Gretchen Whitmer said it would be the first nuclear power plant to be reopened in the United States. It still faces hurdles, including inspections, testing, and the blessing of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, known as the NRC.Nuclear power is our single largest source of carbon-free electricity, directly supporting 100,000 jobs across the country and hundreds of thousands more indirectly, said Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, a former Michigan governor.The Palisades plant is along Lake Michigan, a two-hour drive from Chicago. A Michigan utility, CMS Energy, owned it from 1971 until the plant was sold to Louisiana-based utility Entergy in 2007. It was shut down in 2022.The repowering of Palisades will restore safe, around-the-clock generation to hundreds of thousands of households, businesses, and manufacturers, said Kris Singh, Holtec president and chief executive.Nuclear energy is in the spotlight. Thirty-four countries, including the United States, last week pledged to use it to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. In California, regulators in December said the Diablo Canyon plant could operate through 2030 instead of 2025 to guard against blackouts as the state shifts toward renewable power sources. Owner Pacific Gas & Electric said federal aid helped it repay a state loan.There is more enthusiasm toward nuclear power  in Congress, in the industry, and also internationally, said Najmedin Meshkati, an engineering professor at the University of Southern California who has inspected nuclear plants around the world.It puts the onus and burden on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Holtec to double down on efforts to make sure this plant is safe enough and all the safety measures are intact, Meshkati said of Palisades.

(Robert Hunziker)Nuclear radiation which threatens life on planet earth is not front page news in comparison to the most insignificant issues of public concern, including the local level crime scene or the tabloid gossip reports on Hollywood celebrities.While the long-term repercussions of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster are yet to be fully assessed, they are far more serious than those pertaining to the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in the Ukraine, which resulted in almost one million deaths (New Book Concludes  Chernobyl death toll: 985,000, mostly from cancer Global Research, September 10, 2010, See also Matthew Penney and Mark Selden The Severity of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster: Comparing Chernobyl and Fukushima, Global Research, May 25, 2011)Moreover, while all eyes were riveted on the Fukushima Daiichi plant, news coverage both in Japan and internationally failed to fully acknowledge the impacts of a second catastrophe at TEPCOs (Tokyo Electric Power Co Inc) Fukushima Daini nuclear power plant.An opinion poll in May 2011 confirmed that more than 80 per cent of the Japanese population do not believe the governments information regarding the nuclear crisis. (quoted in Sherwood Ross, Fukushima: Japans Second Nuclear Disaster, Global Research, November 10, 2011)The Japanese government has been obliged to acknowledge that the severity rating of its nuclear crisis  matches that of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. In a bitter irony, however, this tacit admission by the Japanese authorities has proven to be part of the cover-up of a significantly larger catastrophe, resulting in a process of global nuclear radiation and contamination:While Chernobyl was an enormous unprecedented disaster, it only occurred at one reactor and rapidly melted down. Once cooled, it was able to be covered with a concrete sarcophagus that was constructed with 100,000 workers. There are a staggering 4400 tons of nuclear fuel rods at Fukushima, which greatly dwarfs the total size of radiation sources at Chernobyl. ( Extremely High Radiation Levels in Japan: University Researchers Challenge Official Data, Global Research, April 11, 2011)Hazardous radioactive elements being released in the sea and air around Fukushima accumulate at each step of various food chains (for example, into algae, crustaceans, small fish, bigger fish, then humans; or soil, grass, cows meat and milk, then humans). Entering the body, these elements  called internal emitters  migrate to specific organs such as the thyroid, liver, bone, and brain, continuously irradiating small volumes of cells with high doses of alpha, beta and/or gamma radiation, and over many years often induce cancer. (Helen Caldicott, Fukushima: Nuclear Apologists Play Shoot the Messenger on Radiation, The Age, April 26, 2011)While the spread of radiation to the West Coast of North America was casually acknowledged, the early press reports (AP and Reuters) quoting diplomatic sources stated that only tiny amounts of radioactive particles have arrived in California but do not pose a threat to human health. Greg Jaczko, chair of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, told White House reporters on Thursday (March 17) that his experts dont see any concern from radiation levels that could be harmful here in the United States or any of the U.S. territories.What prevails is a well organized camouflage. The public health disaster in Japan, the contamination of water, agricultural land and the food chain, not to mention the broader economic and social implications, have neither been fully acknowledged nor addressed in a comprehensive and meaningful fashion by the Japanese authorities.Japan as a nation state has been destroyed. Its landmass and territorial waters are contaminated. Part of the country is uninhabitable. High levels of radiation have been recorded in the Tokyo metropolitan area, which has a population of 39 million (2010) (more than the population of Canada, circa 34 million (2010)) There are indications that the food chain is contaminated throughout Japan:Radioactive cesium exceeding the legal limit was detected in tea made in a factory in Shizuoka City, more than 300 kilometers away from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Shizuoka Prefecture is one of the most famous tea producing areas in Japan.A tea distributor in Tokyo reported to the prefecture that it detected high levels of radioactivity in the tea shipped from the city. The prefecture ordered the factory to refrain from shipping out the product. After the accident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant, radioactive contamination of tea leaves and processed tea has been found over a wide area around Tokyo. (See 5 More Companies Detect Radiation In Their Tea Above Legal Limits Over 300 KM From Fukushima, June 15, 2011)Japans industrial and manufacturing base is prostrate. Japan is no longer a leading industrial power. The countrys exports have plummeted. The Tokyo government has announced its first trade deficit since 1980.While the business media has narrowly centered on the impacts of power outages and energy shortages on the pace of productive activity, the broader issue pertaining to the outright radioactive contamination of the countrys infrastructure and industrial base is a scientific taboo(i.e the radiation of industrial plants, machinery and equipment, buildings, roads, etc).A report released in January 2012 points to the nuclear contamination of building materials used in the construction industry, in cluding roads and residential buildings throughout Japan.(See FUKUSHIMA: Radioactive Houses and Roads in Japan. Radioactive Building Materials Sold to over 200 Construction Companies, January 2012)A coverup report by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (May 2011), entitled Economic Impact of the Great East Japan Earthquake and Current Status of Recovery presents Economic Recovery as a fait accompli.The impacts of nuclear radiation on the work force and the countrys industrial base are not mentioned. The report states that the distance between Tokyo -Fukushima Dai-ichiis of the order of 230 km (about 144 miles) and that the levels of radiation in Tokyo are lower than in Hong Kong and New York City. (Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, Impact of the Great East Japan Earthquake and Current Status of Recovery, p.15).This statement is made without corroborating evidence and in overt contradiction with independent radiation readings in Tokyo (see map below). In recent developments, Sohgo Security Services Co. is launching a lucrative radiation measurement service targeting households in Tokyo and four surrounding prefectures.A map of citizens measured radiation levels shows radioactivityis distributed in a complex pattern reflecting the mountainous terrain and the shifting winds across a broad area of Japan north of Tokyo which is in the center of the of bottom of the map.Radiation limits begin to be exceeded at just above 0.1 microsieverts/ hour blue. Red is about fifty times the civilian radiation limit at 5.0 microsieverts/hour. Because children are much more sensitive than adults, these results are a great concern for parents of young children in potentially affected areas.The fundamental question is whether the vast array of industrial goods and components Made in Japan  including hi tech components, machinery, electronics, motor vehicles, etc  and exported Worldwide are contaminated? Were this to be the case, the entire East and Southeast Asianindustrial base which dependsheavily on Japanesecomponents and industrial technology would be affected.The potential impacts on international trade would be farreaching. In this regard, in January, Russian officials confiscated irradiated Japanese automobiles and autoparts in the port of Vladivostok for sale in the Russian Federation. Needless to say, incidents of this nature in a global competitive environment, could lead to the demise of the Japanese automobile industrywhich is already in crisis.While most of the automotive industry is in central Japan, Nissans engine factory in Iwaki city is 42 km from the Fukushima Daiichi plant. Is the Nissan work force affected? Is the engine plant contaminated? The plant is within about 10 to 20 km of the governments evacuation zone from which some 200,000 people were evacuated (see map below).Nuclear energy is not a civilian economic activity. It is an appendage of the nuclear weapons industry which is controlled by the so-called defense contractors. The powerful corporate interests behind nuclear energy and nuclear weapons overlap.In Japan at the height of the disaster, the nuclear industry and government agencies [were] scrambling to prevent the discovery of atomic-bomb research facilities hidden inside Japans civilian nuclear power plants.1 (See Yoichi Shimatsu, Secret Weapons Program Inside Fukushima Nuclear Plant? Global Research, April 12, 2011)In both cases, the devastating health impacts of nuclear radiation are casually denied. Tactical nuclear weapons with an explosive capacity of up to six times a Hiroshima bomb are labelled by the Pentagon as safe for the surrounding civilian population.Such an action would result in the unthinkable: a nuclear holocaust over a large part of the Middle East and Central Asia. A nuclear nightmare, however, would occur even if nuclear weapons were not used.Disclaimer: The contents of this article are of sole responsibility of the author(s).

Matthew Szydagis, 41, has spent the last two years toiling in a laboratory deep beneath the University of Albany campus, blasting bits of lithium with ion beams to test the nature of its fission reactions.The physics professor discovered that lithium, commonly used in cellphone batteries used in phones, cars, and other technologies, only becomes fissionable when hit by the ions  and stabilizes when the beams stop.The concept is to have fission that you can turn on and turn off, Szydagis told The Post. Thats what really creates the incredible safety factor and makes it completely different from standard nuclear power.All of our nuclear power plants were created after the Manhattan Project and after the bomb. So the only way we knew how to make nuclear energy was to take the same technology and same ideas from bombs, Szydagis said, explaining that uranium has remained the standard fuel in nuclear plants throughout their history.Szydagis model could also potentially negate the dangers of uranium waste created from standard nuclear reactors. Unlike uranium, which can take almost a billion years to no longer be radioactive, fissioned lithium takes a matter of hours, minutes, worst case days or weeks to become safe.Though only tested on small samples so far, if Szydagis lithium-based model scales as he expects it would have the potential to replace uranium in reactors across the world  and possibly eliminate the public safety fears that have prevented the clean energy source from powering the entire planet.The beauty of nuclear power  any nuclear power, my idea as well as traditional uranium-based plants  is that they can be built with nearly zero carbon footprint and run with nearly zero CO2 output, he said.Szydagis believes that a climate change cataclysm has already begun and estimates that New York City will be underwater by 2100 if nothing is done to prevent it. However, if successful, his lithium-based nuclear energy could have an enormous impact on keeping future generations safe.Ill put it very bluntly  someone sitting in New York may not end up underwater anymore in 50 years if his idea succeeds, he explained. So I would say thats a pretty big impact: to not have Manhattan become the next lost city of Atlantis.Dark matter hunters spend their time creating neutrons to throw at detectors  something the University of Albanys subterranean particle collider is uniquely equipped for  and during such experimentation with his team Szydagis struck on the lithium idea.The process remains in its early stages. Szydagis has a patent pending and is looking for funding to expand the size of his experiments, which he will then write up into a paper for peer review and then look at further expansion.Im not claiming any new physics. Im not saying Ive got some crackpot zero point energy or some magical thing that doesnt actually exist  Im doing bread and butter, nuclear fission thats been understood for many, many decades.

The result keeps the Democratic Progressive Party, which broadly favors Taiwanese sovereignty and closer ties with the United States, at the helm of government for a third consecutive term. Although managing relations with Beijing garners the most international attention, perhaps no problem will be more vexing to the DPP than Taiwans energy situation, which is precarious.After a contested race, the people of Taiwan have elected current Vice President Lai Ching-te to be their next president. The result keeps the Democratic Progressive Party, which broadly favors Taiwanese sovereignty and closer ties with the United States, at the helm of government for a third consecutive term. Although managing relations with Beijing garners the most international attention, perhaps no problem will be more vexing to the DPP than Taiwans energy situation, which is precarious.Taiwan imports 97 percent of its energy through highly vulnerable maritime shipping routes. Any quarantine, blockade, or invasion of the island by China would devastate its ability to sustain basic services and critical infrastructurenot to mention the factories that produce approximately 90 percent of the worlds most advanced semiconductors. At the moment, best estimates suggest that Taiwans strategic energy stockpiles contain only enough natural gas to last 11 days and enough coal to last 39 days. Even though Taipei acknowledges these vulnerabilities, solutions are in short supply.Taiwan was not always so energy dependent; just a few decades ago, it was a major producer of nuclear energy. During the mid-1980s, nuclear power accounted for roughly half of the islands electricity consumption. At the time, Taiwan had six operable reactors, with plans to build more. But in the last two decades, Taipei has reduced its reliance on nuclear energy, and the DPP, which rose to prominence during nuclear powers heyday on an anti-nuclear wave, played a key role in this shift. When the party won the presidency in 2016, it pledged to phase out nuclear power entirely. If Lai fulfills the promises of his predecessor, the islands final two reactors will go offline by next year.Considering its location in one of the worlds most contentious bodies of water and its fraught relationship with Beijing, Taiwans resistance to what was once a dependable domestic source of power may seem puzzling. For Taipei, however, its complicated. Lais impending choice of whether to preserve or abandon the nuclear option will be informed by a long and lesser-known history of proliferation, espionage, disaster, and democratization.Taipeis interest in all things nuclear began during the early days of the atomic age. In December 1949, after years of civil war with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), Gen. Chiang Kai-shek relocated Nationalist forces to the island of Taiwan, where he established a dictatorship under Kuomintang (KMT) party rule. Chiang did not, however, abandon ambitions to recapture the mainland, and as the general consolidated power, he saw nuclear technology as a means of acquiring international prestige and geopolitical advantage. Although there were internal disagreements over whether Taipei should immediately move to acquire nuclear weapons, the government began building latent capabilities under the guise of civilian projects.In 1955, Taiwan and the United States reached an agreement for cooperation on the peaceful uses of atomic energy that kick-started Taiwans nuclear program, allowing the KMT government to obtain key technologies and send scientists and military personnel abroad for training and education. Although Taipei officially renounced nuclear weapons in exchange for Washingtons assistance with civilian projects, in practice leaders hedged their bets, cultivating expertise that could be directed toward other ends.Taiwans covert nuclear weapons program began in earnest following Chinas first successful nuclear test in 1964. The test shattered Taiwans sense of security. Although the United States had committed itself to Taiwan in the 1955 Mutual Defense Treaty, the KMT government feared abandonment, especially after the White House rebuffed its calls to strike mainland Chinese nuclear facilities. Leaders also worried that proliferation would bolster Beijings status in the international community at Taipeis expense. Once Beijing crossed this threshold, the KMT government doubled down on its own nuclear weapons program. To spearhead these efforts, leaders established the Institute of Nuclear Energy Research, which was closely linked to the militaryalthough the government publicly insisted that its activities were exclusively civilian.In 1969, Taiwan purchased a natural uranium-fueled, heavy water-moderated research reactor, known as the Taiwan Research Reactor, from Canada. (This kind of reactor is conducive to the production of weapons-grade plutonium.) From there, the government tried to acquire other critical technologies, including plutonium reprocessing facilities, from foreign suppliersalthough Washington, increasingly suspicious of Taipeis intentions, thwarted many of these sales. Nevertheless, Taiwans weaponization research and indigenous capabilities progressed, albeit at a smaller scale and slower pace than originally planned.Despite its covert plans, Taiwan signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1968 and ratified it in 1970, likely hoping to generate goodwill from the international community. But in 1971, the U.N. recognized the Peoples Republic of China, based on the mainland, as the only legitimate representatives of China, kicking Taiwan, otherwise known as the Republic of China, out of the multilateral body. By extension, Taiwan lost its membership in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and International Atomic Energy Association, compounding the governments anxieties about declining international support. This decision also made it harder for the international community to monitor the islands nuclear facilities and enforce nonproliferation norms, precisely as nuclear weapons became more appealing for both status and security reasons. Taiwans concerns became even more acute after then-U.S. President Richard Nixons historic visit to China in 1972.As its weapons program took off, Taiwan also began building nuclear power plants. The KMT had ambitious plans to transform the island into a modern, industrial economy, but the 1973 oil crisis demonstrated the perils of Taiwans lack of indigenous energy resources. Nuclear energy emerged as a viable alternative to imported fossil fuels since the island already possessed the requisite expertise and infrastructure. The growth of nuclear power facilitated the growth of industry on the island; without it, its difficult to imagine that Taiwan would be the leader of the global semiconductor supply chain today.As Taiwans nuclear power sector grew, its leaders used civilian programs to justify proliferation-sensitive activities, but their cover wasnt entirely convincing. In 1977, after U.S. and International Atomic Energy Association inspectors unearthed further evidence that Taiwan was engaging in illicit research and diverting materials from the Taiwan Research Reactor, Washington decided to intervene. Although it downplayed Taiwans capabilities in public, in private the Carter administration threatened to impose sanctions and cut off military assistance unless Taiwan refocused on exclusively peaceful applications. Taiwans growing dependence on nuclear power enhanced Washingtons leverage because the island relied on the United States for reactor fuel and technical support. Washington and Taipei ultimately reached a secret agreement in which the latter promised, among other things, to curtail sensitive activities, export irradiated fuel, and modify the Taiwan Research Reactor to curb plutonium production, functionally making it harder for scientists to amass enough fissile material to secretly build a bomb.Although Taiwan begrudgingly complied with many of these terms, implementation was slow, and the military in particular was dissatisfied by the governments capitulation to U.S. demands. These frustrations assumed a new urgency in December 1978, when the Carter administration announced that it would terminate the U.S.-Republic of China Mutual Defense Treaty and formally recognize the Peoples Republic of China, continuing the Nixon administrations rapprochement with Beijing. This decision precipitated a renewed Taiwanese focus on nuclear weaponsthis time with the military in the drivers seat.The second act in Taiwans proliferation history was fraught. Although the termination of the mutual defense treaty emboldened domestic actors who favored weaponization, the island still relied on the United States for military and economic support. Nor did Taiwanese decision-makers appear to agree on the ultimate goal of a revived nuclear weapons program. While some hoped to quietly develop a small arsenal, others, including then-President Chiang Ching-kuo, apparently favored only acquiring the ingredients to rapidly assemble a bomb (more like the hedging posture of states such as Japan). All these plans were contingent on avoiding detection by the United States or China until the program was sufficiently advanced. Yet past a certain point, keeping things under wraps would have been difficultand extremely risky. If secrecy failed, Taipei risked angering Beijing and alienating Washington in one fell swoop.As it turns out, Taipeis attempts at obfuscation were already compromised. The deputy director of the Institute of Nuclear Energy Research, Chang Hsien-yi, was a CIA mole who had been surreptitiously passing information to the United States for years because he feared the covert weapons program would trigger an unwanted war with China. In January 1988, Chang sent his wife and children on vacation to Tokyo Disneyland and drove to a CIA safehouse. The family was reunited in Seattle a few days later and placed under witness protection.Armed with new proof of malfeasance, the Reagan administration confronted Taipei. Exposed yet again and facing the prospect of U.S. abandonment and Chinese ire, the government agreed to unequivocally dismantle its nuclear weapons program. This included shutting down the Taiwan Research Reactor, shipping heavy water off the island so the reactor could not be restarted, exporting irradiated fuel, and disabling covert facilities and research programs. By the 1990s, Taiwan had functionally abandoned its nuclear weapons ambitions, but its nuclear history was far from over.The demise of Taiwans nuclear weapons program coincided with a profound shift in its domestic politics. Up to this point, the KMT had presided over Taiwans entire nuclear history, maintaining an often brutal political monopoly over the island. By the mid-1980s, however, pro-democracy groups were gaining traction, as economic growth and dissatisfaction with decades of KMT repression fueled popular demands for reform. In 1987, the government lifted martial law and began preparing for a new era of open elections.At the vanguard of this process was the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). When the DPP broke onto the scene, nuclear energy was vital to Taiwans economy. Globally, however, faith in nuclear power was beginning to wane. Infamous accidents sparked fears about nuclear safety, first at Three Mile Island in 1979, then at Chernobyl in 1986as chance would have it, the very year the DPP was founded. This rise in anti-nuclear sentiment was also fueled by revelations that the Taiwanese government had used Orchid Island, an indigenous homeland, as a nuclear waste facility. The nascent party tapped into global momentum and made opposition to nuclear power one of its organizing principles, a means of courting attention abroad while distinguishing itself from the KMT at home.The timing of these developments, however, led to a conflation of Taiwans nuclear weapons and nuclear energy programs. Even now, many Taiwanese associate anything nuclear with the military dictatorship. The same forces that shaped the islands transition away from authoritarian rule thus shaped attitudes toward nuclear power; in other words, the politicization of nuclear energy was a byproduct of Taiwans democratization.In the short term, growing opposition to nuclear power did not negate its practical role in Taiwans energy makeup. The KMT maintained that nuclear power was the only way to avoid dependence on fossil fuel imports, and in 1999, a KMT-led government broke ground on a long-planned fourth nuclear power plant called Lungmen, which would have included the first Generation III reactors built outside Japan. When the DPP captured the presidency for the first time in 2000, the newly elected cabinet suspended construction. Yet it backtracked just a year later, after various legal and political challenges. Despite the opposition of many activists, work at Lungmen continued over the next decade, although it was plagued by delays, controversies, and cost overruns.In 2011, another accident, this time at Japans Fukushima nuclear power plant, decisively tilted the scales against nuclear power in Taiwan. Like Japan, Taiwan is prone to seismic activity, and the Fukushima accident revived anti-nuclear sentiments on the island and throughout the region. Taipei became the single largest donor to Fukushimas victims, and thousands of Taiwanese took to the streets to challenge their governments continued reliance on nuclear energy. Fearing public unrest, in 2014 the government again halted construction at Lungmen, even though work was nearly complete. Although Taiwans president at the time, KMT leader Ma Ying-jeou, supported the project, he backed down following mass protests, including a hunger strike by Lin Yi-hsiung, a former DPP chairman and hero of Taiwans pro-democracy movement. In 2016, the DPP campaigned on the promise of a nuclear-free homeland, and after a historic victory the party started the process of decommissioning Taiwans reactors as their licenses expired.In other respects, however, the DPPs energy policies have come up short. The decision to phase out nuclear power has left Taiwan more dependent on imported fuel precisely as global energy prices skyrocket and the domestic need for clean and reliable energy becomes more acute.Recognizing the enduring challenge of energy insecurityand the growing imperative to reduce carbon emissionscurrent President Tsai Ing-wen promised that renewables would generate 20 percent of Taiwans electricity by 2025. But Taiwan has repeatedly missed these targets; renewables currently account for only 8 percent. Taipei has doubled down on offshore wind projects, since the islands mountainous terrain precludes large-scale solar development. Although technological advances or regulatory reforms may give the sector a boost, expansion is limited by available space. Turbines located in the Taiwan Strait would also be vulnerable in a crisis, and many investors are wary about supporting projects situated in such a precarious geopolitical location.Renewables might improve Taiwans resilience down the line, but they are unlikely to be sufficient anytime soon. In the meantime, the island will continue to rely heavily on coal (42 percent) and natural gas (nearly 39 percent) for electricity generation, making it one of the dirtiest power users in the region. This presents challenges for Taiwans sizable industrial base. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company alone accounts for more than 6 percent of the islands total energy consumption, and demand is only going up. Industry leaders also worry that failure to meet climate targets will reduce export competitiveness.Meanwhile, a more ambitious and militarily capable China is making it even harder to separate energy security from geopolitics. The Chinese navy regularly rehearses blockade and quarantine scenarios that underscore its ability to disrupt Taiwans energy supply chains. While Taipei is taking steps to deepen its strategic stockpiles, current storage facilities for liquefied natural gas in particular are inadequate and vulnerable to a potential blockade.These dynamics have resurfaced questions about the future of nuclear power in Taiwan. Although anti-nuclear sentiment remains salient, when the DPP held a referendum on its phase-out policy in November 2018, 59 percent of voters rejected it, citing environmental concerns and the perils of energy insecurity. And during the recent elections, Lais opponents endorsed proposals to reconsider the Lungmen project and keep remaining reactors online past 2025.For now, as incoming president, Lai remains committed to decommissioning Taiwans final reactors, although in October he said he wouldnt rule out the use of safe, waste-free nuclear. Some reports also suggest that policymakers are looking into keeping nuclear reactors on standby in case of emergency, but it is not clear what this would entail.If Taiwan does rethink its nuclear phase-out, it wont be alone. South Korea and Japan are reinvesting in their nuclear enterprises in response to climate and security concerns. That said, implementing a reversal would likely be more challenging in Taiwan, especially with the DPP at the helm. Anti-nuclear sentiments are ingrained in the partys political DNA, and policymakers reaction to the 2018 referendum suggests they are hesitant to buck this legacy.Leaders would also have to contend with various practical challenges. Taiwans viable reactors are at the end of their 40-year lifespans. Although life extensions are possible pending revisions to licensing procedures, over time the risks of an aging nuclear infrastructure in a seismically active area will only increase. Restarting work on the more advanced reactors at Lungmen might address these concerns, but policymakers should be realistic about costs and timelines. In 2019, state-owned energy company Taiwan Power concluded that the project would not be commercially viable for six to seven years, and estimates have likely increased due to the erosion of nuclear expertise on the island and the physical degradation of the site. Industry leaders have expressed interest in more advanced nuclear technologies, such as Small Modular Reactors, which some argue are safer than older models. While this may be a promising option in the future, the technology is not quite there yet.Even if policymakers could agree on it, nuclear energy is no silver bullet. Because of domestic opposition, Taipei still hasnt found a permanent solution for storing and disposing of nuclear waste. Nuclear energy also isnt impervious to blockades, since Taiwan must import reactor fuel (although these supplies can sustain continuous energy production for months once on the island). Perhaps more worrying, the situation at Ukraines Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has underscored just how dangerous it can be when conflict breaks out near nuclear infrastructure. None of these problems are easy to solve, and policymakers must consider the vulnerabilities that come with having nuclear energy programs alongside the risks of eliminating them.But given the immediate ramifications of energy insecurityboth for the prospects of deterring Chinese aggression and for the globally significant industries located on the islandthe next Taiwanese government should invite serious and specific conversations about the tradeoffs before dismissing the nuclear option altogether. Although decades of politicization have charged debates, nuclear energy programs are inherently technical endeavors. Reviving them only becomes more difficult when governments allow experience, expertise, and infrastructure to atrophy.Taiwan now finds itself backed into something of a corner by its own colorful history. How the Lai administration responds at this inflection point may determine whether the islands nuclear legacy lives on, or whether it gives up these ghosts once and for all.Andrew W.

An African woman prepares traditional injera bread in her home in Berhale, Ethiopia. Climate alarmists anti-fossil fuel mania would keep those like her in the Third World from ever enjoying the modernity of electricity and thereby keep them cooking and heating their homes by burning wood and dried dung. Reliance on those methods exposes her and millions of others around the world to harmful fumes, leading to serious health issues, such as lung disease, blindness, and premature death. (Photo: Roberto Moiola/Sysaworld/ Moment/Getty Images)We all want a future where humans can thrive in a clean environment. But as the eye-opening documentary Climate the Movie: The Cold Truth reveals, while we hear dire warnings that we must rapidly eliminate fossil fuels to avoid a climate catastrophe, we are manufacturing a humanitarian crisis of our own.That means maintaining an energy mix that can handle natures curveballs. It means maximizing our options, not banning entire categories of energy the world still needs. But as environmentalists seek to ban fossil fuels, they are raising the price of electricity for some and depriving others in emerging economies of that valuable resource.The movie aired on YouTube the same week that the Environmental Protection Agency issued final regulations requiring 70% of new cars sold to be hybrid or battery-powered electric by 2032. But that raises costs and inconveniences households for no gain, because banning fossil fuels in America would not affect global temperatures.Despite headlines about worsening hurricanes, data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows no long-term increase in the frequency or intensity of U.S. hurricanes since records began being kept in the mid-1800s.For the worlds poorest nations, giving up fossil fuels is catastrophic. Affordable, dependable power is a life-or-death matter when it comes to delivering basic needs, such as health care, sanitation, safe drinking water, and protection from heat waves and cold snaps.Germanys renewable-energy mandates have driven consumer prices to more than triple the levels seen in the United States. This entirely avoidable situation places a heavy burden on German businesses, unnecessarily increasing their operating costs.By all means, lets use renewable technologies as they become reliable and cost-effective, including nuclear energy. Attempting to legislate an accelerated transition is a recipe for disaster when reality collides with wishful thinking.This is a critical year in the history of our country. Americans are polarized and divided. Roughly half of the country is clamoring for socialist policies like more government control over health care, increased regulations, and open borders.

Russia unleashed one of its most devastating attacks against Ukraine's electric sector on Friday, an aerial assault it said was retaliation for recent strikes inside Russia and which could signal an escalation of the war just days after President Vladimir Putin cemented his grip on power in a preordained election.Many Ukrainians were plunged into darkness across several cities, at least five people were killed, and damage to the countrys largest hydroelectric plant briefly cut off power to a nuclear plant that has been a safety risk throughout the war.Russia fired off more than 60 exploding drones and 90 missiles in what Ukrainian officials described as the most brutal attack against its energy infrastructure since the full-scale war began in early 2022.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been urging Western allies for weeks to provide it with additional air-defense systems and ammunition, a period in which $60 billion in U.S. aid has been held up by divisions in Congress.Russia's defense ministry called the Friday attacks strikes of retribution. Ukraine has increased shelling of Russia's Belgorod region along its northeast border and has launched drone strikes targeting Russian oil refineries and other energy facilities.Russia has made progress on the battlefield in recent months against exhausted Ukrainian troops struggling with a shortage of manpower and ammunition along the front line that stretches over 1,000 kilometers (621 miles).When Putin invaded in 2022, he called it a special military operation, and his officials have mostly eschewed the word war. But in a change of rhetoric Friday that may herald a new escalation, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told a Russian newspaper that when the collective West became a participant in this on the side of Ukraine, for us it already became a war.In the winter of 2022-23, Russia targeted Ukraines energy infrastructure, causing frequent blackouts across the country. Many in Ukraine and the West expected that Russia might repeat the strategy this winter, but Russia instead focused its strikes on Ukraines defense industries.Kudrytskyi said that Russia "tried to destroy every significant energy object powering the city of Kharkiv, leaving at least 700,000 without electricity. He estimated that several hundred thousand customers in other regions were also left without power.Oleksiy Kuleba, deputy head of Zelenskyy's office, said that 31 people were injured in the strikes, which also left 200,000 people without constant access to electricity in the Odesa region. He said that power supplies for most of 400,000 customers in the Dnipropetrovsk region were restored.The huge Dnipro hydroelectric power plant, Ukraine's largest, halted operation after sustaining at least six missile hits that caused massive damage. Ihor Syrota, the head of Ukrhidroenergo company overseeing the country's hydroelectric plants, said it lost about a third of its generation capacity in a significant loss for the Ukrainian energy system.Syrota said that the extent of damage to the plant remained unclear because its equipment has been buried under concrete and metal debris from the blasts, noting that the repairs will be a long process.The strikes sparked a fire at the Dnipro plant, which supplies electricity to the nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia, the largest in Europe. Power to the nuclear plant was lost for several hours before it was restored, International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi said early Friday. The Zaporizhzhia plant has been occupied by Russian troops since early days of the invasion, and fighting around it has raised the risk of a nuclear accident.The dam at the hydroelectric station was not in danger of breaching, the country's hydroelectric authority said. A dam breach could not only disrupt supplies to the nuclear plant but could potentially cause severe flooding like what occurred last year when a major dam at Kakhovka further down the Dnieper River collapsed.

Today is Opening Day for Major League Baseballwell, kind-of. MLB kicked off the regular season in South Korea this morning with the first of two games between the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres.MLB has to be happy with the teams it chose to headline its international showcase, especially in the case of the Dodgers. Los Angeles was the star of the offseason, as the franchise gave superstar Shohei Ohtani the largest contract in American team sports history and has seen a spike in demand for tickets on the secondhand market.Fans of MLBs 28 other teams will have to wait a little longer for their baseball fix. While the Seoul Series counts as two regular season games for Los Angeles and San Diego, the rest of the league wont experience Opening Day until March 28.Some lying down, others standing, among garbage and wire with razor blades, migrants try to persuade the agents of the Texas National Guard to open the fence, which is guarded, installed days ago with the intention of complicating the crossing of migrants who reach this border in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico on March 19, 2024. The blockade is permanent by the military, so migrants choose to set up a camp on the side of Rio Bravo, a bonfire makes them gather near it, four blankets serve as shelter against the few rays of the sun on the cloudy morning of Tuesday to a family.A federal appeals court issued an order late Tuesday halting a controversial Texas law that would allow state and local law enforcement to arrest people they suspect entered the country illegally, hours after the Supreme Court issued a temporary ruling allowing the law. The Mexican government had condemned the Supreme Courts ruling, adding that it was bilaterally working with the U.S. government to ensure safe and orderly migration, and will not be affected by state or local decisions. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals is set to begin a hearing on the law today.Presidents could face blackmail and extortion in the future, former President Donald Trump warned in a legal brief filed Tuesday with the Supreme Court, if they arent granted absolute immunity for official acts conducted while in office. The filing comes ahead of arguments that will be heard by the Supreme Court next month, and represents Trump doubling down on the argument that presidential immunity should exempt him from charges in all four of his criminal cases.Federal Aviation Administration chief Michael Whitaker told NBC anchor Lester Holt in an interview that aired Tuesday that Boeings priorities have been on production and not safety and quality, citing a culture survey of Boeing and the FAAs audit into the company. When asked if certain protocols werent being met in terms of Boeings airplane production, Whitaker said the companys process was not what you wouldve expected if safety is the first priority.Bitcoin is already retreating from its all-time highthe worlds largest cryptocurrency fell 7% by Tuesday morning, and is down 15% from its $73,000 record set last Thursday. Bitcoins price is historically much more volatile than stock prices, which combined with traders tendency to take profits following a massive runup in asset prices can cause notable downward swings.Mustafa Suleyman is leaving Inflection AI, the maker of chatbot Pi, for Microsoft in a massive shakeup at one of Silicon Valleys highest-valued artificial intelligence startups.

So far, theyve signed up more than 100 credit unions and small community banks serving 16 million consumers.With AI in his company name and product, CEO Njay has been fielding a stream of calls from venture capitalists. Hes happy to talk, he says, because at some point, the right investor might help scale up growth. Im just dating, Njay says. We are in a good place, it's not like we need money.Thats because Njay, 37, and CIO Kim, 59, have been able to get their company to this point with just $1 million of their own savings, a $3 million credit line from TMCC, an Indian credit union run by Njays fatherand cruciallyby bootstrapping growth using internally generated revenue.Its not just fintech, either. Other industriessuch as direct-to-consumer ecommercehave already gone through the process of discovering that the winners arent always those with investors throwing money at them before they even have any sales.People are finally converting to the religion of profitability, crows Mike Salguro, who launched meat delivery service ButcherBox in 2015 with $10,000 of savings and a kickstarter campaign offering pre-sales of his premium cuts. While food box services with big VC dollars behind them have struggled, ButcherBox has been profitable since its first year.And Simple Modern, which sells sleekly designed water bottles and other utilitarian products, has become a major success via bootstrappingit made $40 million in profit on $200 million in 2023 sales. Its not just that CEO Mike Beckham doesnt need money from VCs. Its a matter of autonomy, he says.Says Beckham: We stayed bootstrapped because we really felt like we weren't going to be able to run the type of company that we wanted to run if we took outside capital, that the demands of the shareholders or their interests might conflict with some of the things that we wanted to do, especially when it came to giving money away [via donations].WHY IT MATTERS U.S. venture firms raised just $67 billion in 2023, the lowest haul since 2017 and down 61% from 2022. Yes, the VCs are still chasing deals in AI and have plenty of uncommitted funds. But the continued weakness in the market for initial public offerings since 2021s record (and poor-performing) crop, is dragging down private market valuations and limiting what VCs consider worth funding.Despite all the hype, public trust in AI and the companies developing it is decliningglobally, trust in AI companies has dropped to 53% from 61% five years ago, according to data from Edelman. Of course, the simplest way to look at this challenge is that in order for people to trust AI, it has to be trustworthy. Transparent AI means building tools, processes and algorithms that are understandable to non-experts.A next-generation nuclear power plant from Bill Gates-founded TerraPower is set to begin construction in June, marking the start of a larger initiative from the company that aims to bring more affordable and efficient reactors to a competitive nuclear energy market.

The House bill [H.R. 6544] would also extend the Price-Anderson federal accident insurance subsidy, first enacted in 1957 and renewedseven timessince then. The program expires at the end of 2025. It isnt clear why this federal subsidy for nuclear in still needed when the industry insists its new, advanced reactor designs are inherently walk-away safe.The U.S. nuclear industry in recent days has hit three cherries on the federal money-and-policy slot machine. The open question is whether the largess (some might call itpork) will have the intended results: revitalizing a moribund industry by hitching its wagon to the feverish fear of climate change and long-run animosity toward nuclear rivals China and Russia.First, the moneythe most tangible of the goodies Congress and the White House have doled out. On March 5, the ranking members of the House and Senate appropriations committees rolled out a consensus on six money balls, including theEnergy and Water Development and Related Agencies billfunding all government nuclear programs for fiscal year 2024. Passage is almost certainly a done deal.On February 28, the House by an overwhelming 365-36 bipartisan margin passedH.R. 6544, designed to streamline safety reviews by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and give the Department of Energy some authority to buy electricity through purchase power agreements from commercial nuclear power purveyors.In some respects, the legislation is a return to the approach of the now-defunct Atomic Energy Commission in the early days of atomic energy. In 1974,Congress abolished the AEC, and the all-power congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, in large part because the AEC viewed reactor safety as a poor cousin to promotion the atom.to ensure that, while upholding the policies of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA), the licensing and regulation of nuclear activities are carried out efficiently without unduly restricting the potential of nuclear energy and to improve the general welfare and the benefits of nuclear technology to society.Some observers have suggested this hortatory language is unlikely to survive in the Senate. Senators are trying to combine House provisions with a separate bipartisan bill that passed last year as part of the National Defense Authorization Act but was later axed.The legislation would also create a cadre of up to 210 Supergrade nuclear ninjas, possibly paid more than NRC commissioners in some cases. According to the bill language, under some circumstances, the NRC chairman Chairman may, during any period when such a certification is in effect, fix the compensation for such employees or other personnel serving in a covered position without regard to any provision of title 5, United States Code, governing General Schedule classification and pay rates. These alleged experts appear to have the power to second-guess the Senate-confirmed commissioners.The House bill would also extend the Price-Anderson federal accident insurance subsidy, first enacted in 1957 and renewedseven times since then. The program expires at the end of 2025. It isnt clear why this federal subsidy for nuclear in still needed when the industry insists its new, advanced reactor designs are inherently walk-away safe. Congress apparently believes it can assess the risks of nuclear energy more accurately than private sector actuaries.On March 4, the NRC rejected a staff-written draft rule developed over three years for how to regulate the potential new license applications for a variety of advanced reactors. The commission told the staff to rewrite its proposal for a new Part 53 section of the agencys authority embodied in 10 Code of Federal Regulations, joining the current sections 50 and 52, which pertain to large light-water reactors.According to Utility Dive, a key change ordered by the commission rejected a strict checklist of requirements for probabilistic risk assessments while favoring a more flexible framework suited to simplified reactor designs with passive safety features that utilize natural forces, such as gravity or pressure differentials, rather than operator action.In a news release, NRC Chairman Christopher Hanson said, This proposed rule leverages significantly more risk insights than our existing regulatory framework in making safety determinations. Applicants can use our existing regulations today, but this proposed rule will provide future nuclear developers a clear, additional pathway for licensing. The NRC said it expects to publish the new rule in the Federal Register in about six months.This latest effort to revive the largely stagnant U.S. nuclear program is the third time in the last nearly 20 years that the government has tried to pump new life into atomic power. The U.S. program started grinding to a halt in the mid-1970s and was barely treading water by the 1990s. The pipeline of new reactor licenses emptied in 1974, and as the final builders of plants under construction either completed or abandoned their projects, the workforce and supply chain infrastructure hollowed out.In 2005, Congress passed a new Energy Policies Act, which offered a smorgasbord of financial goodies for new plants including loans (they called them loan guarantees to make them look more palatable to opponents of direct federal subsidies, but the Treasury wrote the checks and received the loan payments), cost overrun protections, and extension of Price-Anderson to 2025.The 2005 act was largely a failure. The two preeminent U.S. nuclear power developers, Westinghouse and General Electric, ended up sorely financially injured and in Japanese hands. Former NRC CommissionerPeter Bradford commented, They placed a big bet on this hallucination of a nuclear renaissance.Then came the first push for small modular reactors, designed to downsize the financial risks and construction costs of nuclear power plants. The strategy was the reverse of the economies of scale that drove the first generation of nuclear power plants, where bigger was always assumed to be better, but wasnt.In 2009, reactor vendor Babcock & Wilcox, which had substantial experience building nuclear power plants for U.S. submarines, announced it would offer a 125-MW pressurized water reactor (later scaled up to 180 MW) and a year later unveiled an alliance with builder Bechtel Corp. They called the project mPower.In 2012, the Obama administration announced a $500 million program for development of small modular reactors. In 2013, mPower won financial assistance from DOE, with an award up to around $126 million. The same year, B&W tried and failed to sell a majority share of mPower, then cut back funding by 75%. Bechtel soon soured on the project, and it officially ran out of steam in 2017 after failure to find a customer.Will the latest government attempt to revive nuclear, driven by global warming concerns, succeed? Its not a given. Theres lots to like about smaller nukes. They produce no CO2, have a relatively small footprint, can be sited fairly close to load.But the economics arent clear, as theNuScale sagademonstrates. Some of the non-LWR advanced reactor designs will present licensing challenges, as there is little history behind them. Sodium cooled fast reactors may be particularly problematic, given the well-known problems of sodium as a coolant and the experience with Superphenix in France and Monju in Japan, plus issues of nuclear weapons proliferation.During my tenure as CEO of a uranium exploration company (Calypso Uranium) I was an officially designated representative of Argentina at the 2005 IAEA Semi-Annual Redbook International Symposium, in Vienna, Austria (IAEA Headquarters).  The proceedings were published as: Uranium production and raw materials for the nuclear fuel cycle-Supply and demand, economics, the environment and energy security (my name is on p.333).  This gave me an opportunity to question leading experts in all phases of the nuclear issue, and the bottle-neck soon became clear.  The Critical Path, for construction and commissioning a nuclear power reactor, was not predictable, due to constant environmentalist lawsuits and the dramatic changes in politics associated with election cycle results.  The result, failure to assemble a realistic economic analysis, was a Fatal Flaw.  All of the above report, encouraging as it is, needs to address the lawfare assault on Nuclear Energy, or the advances will be only in totalitarian regimes.As a consumer, this is not a political or environmental issue for me. It is all about what is the biggest dollar win in the cheapest energy input.  Since I live in PA where there is enormous NG reserves, I am going to be dubious about Nuke guys blaming environmentalists for their inability to tell me they have a better deal for me.  Frack on!Theres lots to like about big and small nukes but the fact that they produce no CO2 isnt an example  its irrelevant. In fact, if anything, its a drawback of nuclear energy  increased CO2 has already increased plant growth all over the world.Any facility that pumps liquids, involves rotating machinery and produces or uses electricity must be maintained. Parts that wear out are replaced, newer versions are installed. A nuclear generator could easily be operational for many decades with programmed maintenance, as they are today. Licensing them for a specific time period flies in the face of reality. Homeowners dont walk away from a house with a worn out washing machine, plumbing problems or a leaky roof, they fix them.When innovators interfere by discovering cost-effective approaches, first you find some troubling concern with their technology, and if that fails, discover that the risk was worse than we thought and adjust the regulatory limits down to half of what the new technology can achieve.STILL repeating the same old -same old from the 1940s  mankind does _not_learn very fast. We really need some new thinkers on the scene, but I ask you, who or how or WHERE will the mold (mould for Brits) be broken? Universities teach the same staid approach that has us in the present quagmire thinking/implementations that have not progressed since the 1940s . we are truly STUCK since big science will ONLY fund what big sci has FUNDED before. NO new thinking/presentation of theory (esp at a low level concerning even the electron and its relationship to the nucleus) is allowed.You couldnt be more wrong. Big science is an arm of government, the impetus for carbon sequestration, hydrogen combustion, solar power and wind farms, all experiments that are subsidized by taxes or enpixelated funds.Enpixelated funds are monetary units created by keystrokes without going through mining and minting or even printing. They are abstractions and do not exist in the observable world yet are accepted as payment for debts. Many businesses do not accept real money, only enpixelated funds, despite the phrase on fiat paper federal reserve notes, this note is legal tender for all debts, public and private, Of course these businesses should be shunned by all but internet commerce requires enpixelated funds and their convenience ensnares the modern who regards the pre-digital era as a hopeless social and economic antique of the past.Fiat currency is what I would call an unreliable store of value. It is real money because it is fungible and accepted as legal tender in most scenarios. Its unreliable because it is easily and persistently debased.Its a real word if someone uses it and others understand it. Most people would probably figure it out if they thought about it a little. Gold or silver has a value anywhere and always has. US Confederate notes, Wiemar German bills and Zimbabwean notes are valueless except as curiosities. Gold coins were used by the Romans to pay their troops because they were accepted everywhere and those troops were stationed all over the Empire. Before and after the American revolution almost any gold or silver coins were accepted in trade as well as coins from the UK.Im just saying that all forms of money depend on supply and demand setting the price of the money.  Gold is useful as money because it is rare, it doesnt corrode, and the quantity mined annually is small compared to the total amount already in circulation. It is very difficult to create new supplies of gold. Therefore it can be a relatively stable store of value.The true value of money is tied to the goods and services produced in an economy. While you may consider gold a good when used to make jewelry, in the form of bullion it has no useful function other than to be a stable store of value. People agree to accept it in exchange for goods and services because they know that nobody can create new gold to debase its value and they know that everybody else accepts it as payment.The value we talk about is really how many goods and services can be obtained with the exchange of a certain weight of gold. If two starving people were in a village where one had a piece of bread and the other had a bar of gold, both people would want the bread, and the gold would be worthless.The real price of money is how many useful goods and services you need to supply to receive a unit of currency, how many loaves of bread or hours of labor do you need to get a gold coin?  If there is too much money chasing the same goods and services, there will be price inflation. The same unit of currency buys less.if there was a massive meteorite of pure gold that increased the worlds gold supply by 20%, that would depress the price of gold, the same as if a government suddenly added 20% to the supply of fiat currency. Of course thats highly unlikely to happen.Funding research is paying for effort irrespective of results. Effort that private companies wont fund because the probability of technical or commercial success or the cost-benefit analysis makes no sense.Researchers are people. Why struggle with a difficult problem for 70-80 hrs/week when you get no more pay than if you plod along or even slack off?  If they are getting paid a secure salary regardless of whether they succeed or fail, some of them spend their 40 hours browsing porn, or commenting on X.Im not saying that it is never in the national interest to invest in basic research. What I am saying is that when the research aims toward a practical application, there must be powerful incentives to achieve the goal.If you want a bunch of functioning frantabulators, its probably far more effective for the government to promise to buy the first working prototype for whatever had been contemplated as the cost of research grants, and to buy the first x frantabulators delivered by any maker on a decreasing pricing scale. That is how you incentivize timely results and remove commercial risk.Subsidies are not what is needed. End all the frivolous lawsuits is what is needed. As soon as they file one arrest ALL involved for insurrection, lock their asses in rundown DC jail and then wait 3 years to give them trials.Grandpas and grandmas taking selfies, and FBI + AntiFa agitators,  and no guns , hardly constitutes an attempt to overthrow the government.   Why did Speaker Pelosi refuse additional manpower for security?And tell me, why was the J6 riot allowed to happen? The Capital Police knew there was going to be trouble, so did the FBI. Trump asked for 20,000 National Guardsmen to assist with crowd and riot control. Why was that not granted?Nobody said Trump signed an order.  He offered the troops to Pelosi, and she turned them down.  If Trump was half the dictator the socialists claim he is, he would have just overrode Pelosi and sent the troops anyway.I am of two minds on this. Ignoring troll-bots like Lusername might allow its mind-numbed nonsense to go unchallenged. On the other hand, its probably best if instead of acknowledging its nonsense we  just down-vote and in a separate comment make the case for the realist point of view just once, refusing to engage in a back-and-forth with a robot.I worked on the cancelled Summer 2/3 project in South Carolina. It wasnt frivolous lawsuits that killed the project. It was Westinghouse incompetence that made a predictable construction schedule impossible and caused costs to spiral out of control. The sister project in Georgia was able to survive because they were a bigger company and took the federal loan guarantees.In that case, what was supposed to be a $10 billion project ended up around $30 billion.Until a reactor vendor comes up with a design and builds the prototype on a predictable schedule at a competitive cost and shows that it can be operated reliably and economically, no one in their right mind will risk their money on it.Until a reactor vendor comes up with a design and builds the prototype on a predictable schedule at a competitive cost and shows that it can be operated reliably and economically, no one in their right mind will risk their money on it.  Yes, and with the endless stream of frivolous lawsuits against nuclear industry when will that happen? Hell, DoE, DoJ and BLM/DoI are participating in the dog pile of frivolous crap.Who on Earth came up with the idea, let alone signed it off?  In short, it is the pride flag applied to the Cross of St. George and it isnt inclusive, its an insult. If a nations flag doesnt include someone, then, that someone has a problem all their own.No strat, youre wrong. Since 1707 the national flag of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland has been the Union jack or flag. The cross of St. George, the Welsh dragon flag and the cross of St. Andrew (or saltire) are not national flags but can be (and have been) used as unofficial flags of national identity and thats fine. But what it is not is the national flag of England, ok?I suppose that the antiquated thinking would refer to identifying as British. I must confess that I dont understand the nuance there. I am a Connecticutian, a New Englander, a US citizen, an American, and a Terran. Being from Connecticut doesnt override my American-ness.So thats why Microsoft is hiring nuclear engineers, eh chumly. Your sad tears will be mocked when your woke corporate masters start building a lot of nuke plants. Even if they are woke like you they are not stupid and realize unreliables cant run their cash cow cloud business data centers. Even a caveman can see it.Entering a market with new SMR technology where wind and solar has a huge political constituency built on receiving tax credits and other incentives worth $100s of billions presents a challenge for the inevitable nuclear renaissance. The only question is how long we want to keep pretending that sunshine and breezes can power a modern society.Seems to be many new nuclear job postings by G&Ts with nuclear in their portfolios.  Graybeards in the industry will likely have the opportunity to make lots of money.  Hopefully there are enough around to pass on their knowledge and expertise to the next generation.Using the Levelized Full System Costs of Electricity (LFSCOE) comparison method, wind plus infrastructure plus battery storage are over twice the cost of an equivalent nuclear power plant. Solar plus battery storage is over 3 times more expensive.Yet our politicians pursue a strategy of HOPE that some magical fairy dust will drop battery and transmission line costs down to virtually nothing or hydrogen electrolysis, a technology known for over 230 years but still 10 times more expensive that natural gas on a heat equivalent basis, will make their current generation preferences cost effective.Captain, As you state, our politicians pursue a strategy of HOPE that some magical fairy dust will drop battery and transmission line costs down to virtually nothing. Actually, if the batteries were free grid scale battery storage for more than four (4) hours would still be too expensive; as I suspect you fully understand. The associated packet cost for enclosure, overcurrent protection, switchgear, fire suppression and more costs $200/KWh of the $500+total packet.There is plenty of Hydrocarbon fuel in the world to wait for the new energy tech that will truly demand destruct the Hydrocarbon markets. Classic nuke power is very expensive old tech. Do your homework on the capital costs and subsidy costs of nuke power.I can see nuke power application in areas where there isnt a ample supply of natural gas pipelines but wholesale tax subsidized transition to nuke power is unnecessary and capital costs make it more expensive than multi-tiered NG powered generation.If it aint broken dont fix it.  In the long run, the nuke power noise will be quenched by the rad environmentalists and the Big energy arm into Washington.  There will be no major transition to nuke power.If the GOP wants to do good, make the hydrocarbon fuel markets free of collusion and ensure that emerging tech like ambient SC, fusion do not get suppressed. Stop our politicians from being leveraged to make people pay through the nose for hydrocarbon fuel and stop with this nuke non-sense.In 50 years or less the hydrocarbon market question will be moot due to emerging tech that will demand destroy the market. Isnt this the crux of the issue now anyway.. By then it will be something else like under population and transition to anti-human economy.The current political goal is not to end the hydrocarbon fuel markets. it is to leverage them and maintain the cash cow while wielding the propaganda weapon to instigate a dystopic anti-human world view that will lead significant depopulation in the 50 year interimthat is to ensure that we continue to consume and pay through the nose as we age out and disappear.Thats the funny thing about Emergent Technologies that are at least 50 years down the road, they havent emerged yet and cant be predicted. This is the same trap that the idiots pushing Wind and Solar as well as Lithium batteries have fallen into  lets go with this, a miracle will occur, then itll all be rosy. No miracle has occurred in the last 50 years so what makes you think itll happen in the next 50?Agree, cost benefit analysis has become an big moving target in the past 4-5 years on the internet. My reading indicates the the capital costs 14 times greater than NG fired plants  putting the cost benefit win on the multi-tier NG electrical generation not nuke. This is especially true we there is a good supply distribution of NG which is a good chunk of the USA..  So it makes no sense to replace existing NG plants with nuke plants.What we need is CNG cars not EVs. EVs with the tax subsidy are crazy expensive. think about the impact of all that taxpayer money going down the drain for Lithium batteries that are useless in 10 years or less.  The people who are pushing for nuke and EVs are an economic wrecking crew.Taxpayer subsidized items like humungous sports stadiums are tech as old as Imperial Rome but still go up on a regular basis in Yankeeland and other wealthy neighborhoods. These expensive monstrosities are actually just big television studios but television itself is old tech, depending on your technological time line. The Nautilus was launched in 1954 but were unaware of improvements to its nuclear propulsion system in the 70 years since, if any, because of paranoid secrecy.Which leads to the issue of nuclear generation construction cost, a significant part of which is hardening the facility against an attack. Nuclear plants are engineered to make them as impervious to a suicidal aircraft or bomb as possible, since the success of the US is deemed to make every significant technological technique it embraces a target of barbarian hordes whose jealousy inspires destruction.Tax subsidies for nuke power are pointless and backwards. Nuke is zero gain over fossil fuel. In the same way renewables are a negative gain compared to multi- tiered natural gas electrical generation.  This is true for a simple reason; natural gas if the cheaper option.  This is true even in the era of global hydrocarbon glut and massive global hydrocarbon fuel collusion artificially propping up fuel prices leveraging war and the climate change hysteria.  I think many people on WUWT think the political movement of climate change and global press of hydrocarbon fuel prices would be solved by nuke it wont be.  It is a political problem not a tech problem.  The rad environmentalists who are covertly funding much of the climate change propaganda have a bigger agenda than the world existing hydrocarbon fuel.  They want greater centralization of power and they will leverage everything to achieve it including partnering sideways with the darlings of Davos Big Oil to achieve it.  Frack On!  These are the same people who have built their massive careers generating consumer tech that we paid and invested in with our IRA and 401Ks..which enabled the massive centralization of information, discourse and markets.The question of tech that has been emerging since 1966  (Ambient SC, cold fusion Solar, SC electrical generation, AI Quantum computing, SC motors, fuel Cells, AI, Internet, Flat Screen TVs. Cell phones, person computers etc.). All this emerging tech was conceptualized in the 1960s and early 70s.anyone hanging out at Cal Tech and MIT would have heard the dreamers working up prototypes and conceptualizing a new world with new tech. And if you were hanging out at some of the top law schools you would have heard about the coming threat to human privacy and other threats to democracy empowered by coming socially integrated computer systems. The fear what that these new systems would threaten representative power via greater and greater centralization of discourse, information, distribution of good and services and markets.I lived in the vortex of these developments in D.C. in those days. My Father being a top systems analyst and cold warrior and my friends at MIT and Georgetown, UVA, and  Georgia, law and John Hopkins computer labs and me working as a research assistant.What caught the imagination of investors was consumer tech because of its power and potential to penetrate personally into the lives of everyone globally creating enormous efficiencies and wealth. A massive revolution of consumers paying for consumable (non-capital) tech creating the capital for global centralization of information, discourse and markets  Remember, we bought the products and provide the data which provided the capital for the systems we have today.double cash for the Tech world.What didnt capture the imagination of investors or government subsidies is emerging energy infrastructure tech .. .except solar, which is useless without viable affordable ambient SCMCS. Additionally, fusion is also being dependent on viable affordable ambient SC.So the lynch pin for truly innovative energy infrastructure tech for highly efficient electrical generation and distribution and eventually fusion got lost in the shuffle or suppressed. This is the lynch pin that would have significantly demand destructed the hydrocarbon fuel markets and weakened the global currency of oil as a weapon of powerEven this past summer we saw the science media completely destroy a purported ambient superconductor LK-99 in 2-3 weeks. How is this science? Since then, there have been glimmers of hope for LK-99 that you have to search high and low for or manipulate a AI chat system to reveal. LOL which is fun BTW.Is this the environment that a new Ambient SC will emerge. heck no.  It doesnt matter if LK-99 was a total goof. The message is clear to anyone doing this researchwatch your step or you will be crushed. Compare this to the endless bogus climate propagandized science the science media puts out the same journals that crushed LK-99 in 3 weeks. Read between the lines and you get my point.ToldYouSo, hasnt anyone told you that yes, nuclear requires materials of construction, but it is less mineral intensive by orders of magnitude at >90% capacity factor and 60-year life cycle vs solar at a<30% CF and 30-year lifecycle? What about battery storage forever being too expensive for more than four (4) hours? No one ever told you about that either?High-level nuclear waste consists largely of spent fuel from nuclear reactors. Though it makes up a small proportion of overall waste volumes, it accounts for the majority of radioactivity. This most potent form of nuclear waste, according to some, needs to be safely stored for up to a million years. Yes, 1 million years  in other words, a far longer stretch of time than the period since Neanderthals cropped up. This is an estimate of the length of time needed to ensure radioactive decay.And nobody has yet given a satisfactory answer to the question of what to do with thousands of metric tonnes of high-level nuclear waste, some of which can remain radioactive, and thereby lethal, for up to 300,000 years. Nowhere in the world has anyone managed to create a place where we can bury extremely nasty nuclear waste forever, says Denis Florin, partner at Lavoisier Conseil, an energy-focused management consultancy in Paris. We cannot go on using nuclear without being adult about the waste, without accepting we need to find a permanent solution.As discussed in the referenced article, France, like all other countries with commercial scale nuclear power plants, is just kicking the can down the road when it comes with how to handle and eventually store/dispose of high level nuclear waste from such reactors.In a process pioneered by France, many of the uranium, plutonium and fission chemicals have been reprocessed into new fuel at the La Hague site, while waste chemicals that cannot be reused have been vitrified, or turned into glass, for short-term storage in shallow sites underground.Well no it doesnt does it? The spent fuel rods are no longer waste after reprocessing so the amount of waste to be dealt with is vastly reduced, not increased. There will always be something that needs to be disposed of with nuclear fission but reprocessing is a way of reducing that waste by a considerable amount as well as reducing the amount of raw fuel that needs to be mined. More efficient.Uhhhh . . . I believe the statement in the Financial Times article I linked about the process itself creates yet more radioactive waste refers to the fact that, in the reprocessing of spent fuel rods, a portion of the reprocessing facility itself (e.g., plumbing, containment vessels, rod handling equipment, storage drums, etc.) becomes radioactive, known as induced radioactivity.  Also, the more radioactive waste certainly includes the chemical waste stream of fluids used in in cutting operations to open the sealed fuel rods and in chemically separating the various isotopes contained therein.Radioisotopes with short half-lives are dangerous for the straightforward reason that they can dose you very heavily (and fatally) in a short time. Such isotopes have been the main causes of radiation poisoning and death after above-ground explosions of nuclear weapons . . .Long-term isotopes are more complicated. They dont dose as heavily, but there are a lot more issues than just that. Plutonium for example is comparatively long-lived, but some of its decay products can be quite nasty . . .The biggest danger from radioisotopes with mid-to-long half lives is that they can keep an entire region of earth nastily radioactive for a very long time, e.g. hundreds or thousands or even tens of thousand of years. Thats the main reason why disposing of reactor wastes, which often contain just such isotopes, is such a contentious issue.Those nukes have cooling towers which emit huge plumes of dihydrogen monoxide. Dihydrogen monoxide is the most powerful greenhouse gas. And it kills 4000 people every year in the U.S. and thousands more worldwide. So maybe we should ban it?The base line of liability for any incorporated business is the capital of the corporation. Once the capital is exhausted, claims cannot be paid. So, if claims exceeded the capital of the utility, it could file a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding in Federal court and the claimants would be paid a prorata portion of their claims. Ex-hypotheis, the utilitys assets were destroyed in the incident and its capital would therefor be severely impaired.PAA addressed this problem by imposing on nuclear plant operators an obligation to purchase liability insurance. It allowed the creation of an entity, n/k/a American Nuclear Insurers, which is a pool of large domestic property-casualty insurance and reinsurance companies, to sell the coverage. The required insurance is now $450 million.But, wait there is more. If the damages exceed $450 million, every licensed nuclear plant operator is required to contribute to a fund to pay those claims up to $131 million. The total amount of these contributions is currently about $12.9 billion. There is an additional required surcharge if those funds are depleted of up to 5% of the original contribution. The act provides for federal court jurisdiction to prioritize payments.Does the act protect the utility companies? Not really. They are protected by their corporate charters. No, it protects the rate payers from being forced to pay extra to replenish the utilitys capital so that it can stay in business. It also creates an industry funded mechanism for paying claims promptly and fulsomely.So, where is the subsidy? There isnt any. The Act makes the industry pay for insurance.The Federal Government is not required to pay anything. https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/nuclear-insurance.htmlNumber two, list the energy sources that are affordable, constant and accessible. Do wind and solar meet any of those requirements? No. Do fossil fuels meet those requirements? Yes. Does nuclear meet those requirements? Yes.It has been a long time since I did the reading but if I recall properly, the Price-Anderson Act has never cost US taxpayers a single penny. It is a Federal Government guarantee demanded by the insurance and finance sectors to limit their costs in case of a major nuclear plant disaster which has never happened. Calling it a subsidy is a convoluted though process although I suppose, if the extremely unlikely ever did happen, it might involve some taxpayer costs, depending on which way the politicians jumped.Nuclear waste storage is a red herring in any rational world. Again, based of earlier reading, the type of reactor normally built in the US, perhaps all of US reactors, use less than 1% of the energy in the fuel rods. According to theory, there are design that can use about 99%, producing very little waste.The leftover stuff could be very valuable in itself for other uses with some processing but I dont know if the processing costs for most of that would be economicalThere are physical difficulties with the design of such reactors, such as materials that can stand up to corrosion well enough to make the designs viable, but the potential is there if there could be enough interest to do the necessary material research (perfect first, build reactors after).Also, some other countries are not hobbled with the same stupidity as US regulations. They reprocess the used fuel, considerably reducing the waste to begin with. As above, this waste can be valuable in itself as a source of radioactive materials that have uses in industry and medicine, as well as for atomic batteries in locations needing moderate power for long periods without human intervention or maintenance.

On Tuesday, the chambers Environment Committee decided to conduct a fact-finding study on the role of nuclear energy in guiding Italy through the energy transition, to achieve decarbonisation by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050. [Shutterstock/Roberto Giachino]The Italian Chamber of Deputies will launch a major inquiry into how nuclear energy could help Italy reach its energy transition goals, a significant step as the country remains the only G7 nation not operating nuclear power stations, having shut down the last plant over 30 years ago.On Tuesday, the chambers Environment Committee decided to conduct a fact-finding study on the role of nuclear energy in guiding Italy through the energy transition, to achieve decarbonisation by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050.A previous attempt to bring back nuclear power from the former pro-nuclear government of late Silvio Berlusconi, who took office in 2008 and proposed that nuclear power comprise 25% of Italys energy mix by 2030, was shot down by a referendum in 2011.If there is a climate emergency, we must have advanced third-generation reactors immediately and not wait for the fourth or fifth, or even nuclear fusion, which is still a dream at the moment, he said, adding that an urgent decarbonisation initiative should commence without delay.Tabarelli, who was recently appointed special envoy to the troubled ex-Ilva steelworks in Taranto, also stressed the importance of nuclear power in Europe, saying that while existing plants such as those in France were ageing, the continent needed nuclear energy to complement the currently less consistent production of renewables.Speaking to Euractiv, Katiuscia Eroe, Legambiente energy expert, said: It is clear, data in hand on the role of nuclear power globally, timing, cost, and unresolved problems, that nuclear power can have no role in Italys energy transition.Safe nuclear power does not exist, its pure science fiction. We do not have time, in a country with an average of more than 140 extreme weather events, to think about failing technologies, she added.In addition, last November, Italys National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development (ENEA) signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Ansaldo Nucleare, RATEN, SCK CEN and Westinghouse Electric Company for the joint industry-wide development of the Small Modular Reactor (SMR).

Russia launched a massive wave of deadly overnight attacks on Ukraine using over 90 missiles and 60 Iranian-made drones, Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Friday, in one of the largest offensives recently."Russian missiles do not have delays, as do aid packages to our country. The 'Shahed' have no indecision, like some politicians. It is important to understand the cost of delays and postponed decisions," he said."We need air defence to protect people, infrastructure, homes and dams. Our partners know exactly what is needed. They can definitely support us... Life must be protected from these non-humans from Moscow"."The enemy is now carrying out the largest attack on the Ukrainian energy industry in recent times," Energy Minister German Galushchenko said on Facebook, adding that shelling had knocked out "one of the power transmission lines feeding" the Zaporizhzhia power plant.Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian mayor of the city of Mariupol, under Russian control since 2022, said on Telegram that a Russian missile had hit a trolleybus at the Dnipro hydroelectric station, also in Zaporizhzhia, killing civilians travelling on it.The combined net income of Turkish banks increased by 14 percent in the first two months of 2024 from a year ago to 74.7 billion Turkish Liras, data from the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BDDK) have shown.
Appointed shadow energy spokesperson a few months earlier, Mr O'Brien's enthusiasm for nuclear power was already well known, but not yet fully formed as Coalition policy. By many in Canberra, it had been regarded with idle curiosity."I've heard many stories about the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, including some unfounded horror stories and wildly untrue claims. I therefore decided to travel to Fukushima to find out for myself," he said."Tell him he's dreaming," Mr Bowen said last Sunday when asked about the Coalition's plans. His concern was not safety, where there have been significant improvements since Fukushima, but cost and practicality."I don't know what expert he's talking to  The average build time of a nuclear power plant in the United States has been 19 years. Ted O'Brien thinks he can do it in Australia from 10 [years] with a standing start," he said.The CSIRO and the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) tell us that even with the cost of transmission and storage, renewables are still the cheapest form of power, with the temporary exception of gas, which the government says will play a role in the transition.And while noteworthy historic disasters have given nuclear power something of a PR problem, the government's nuclear expert agency says the latest technology is much safer than Chernobyl or Fukushima might suggest.First, large-scale nuclear power plants are expensive. The cheap power produced by plants in Europe comes only after decades of operation, enough time for the operators to have recouped their significant upfront capital costs.A single large plant of the sort used in Europe, according to CSIRO and AEMO, would account for such a huge chunk of our power needs that it would be inadvisable, since the whole grid would falter if the plant went offline for maintenance, or due to some fault.Some have called instead for "small modular reactors" (SMRs)  mini nuclear plants, assembled in a factory, which can be set up quickly. Unlike large plants, they can also be switched on and off quickly, which means they could "pinch hit" to provide power alongside renewables or other power sources.But the change in leadership after the 2022 election saw a surprisingly rapid shift  with new Nationals leader David Littleproud openly calling for nuclear power to be on the table just weeks after polling day.Peter Dutton also flagged early enthusiasm, although at first only in principle. Then, shortly after the Dunkley by-election loss a fortnight ago, he confirmed this would become official Coalition policy.MPs in those areas would have the difficult task of selling a nuclear reactor to their electorate. So far, they seem cautiously enthusiastic, though some wantassurances the technology is safe. Gippsland MP Darren Chester warned community concerns would need to be "ameliorated".There's also the question of where to put the waste. Mr Dutton has sought to "put things in perspective" by pointing out the waste generated in the US since the 1950s "would fit in the area the size of a football field, to a depth of about nine metres".But if selling locals a nuclear plant is challenging, selling them a nuclear dump would be even more so although as Mr Dutton points out, the same challenge awaits on waste from nuclear submarines under the AUKUS agreement.And energy experts say that realistically, any private sector contribution would only come if investors had enough confidence the project would make it through to completion. That would require bipartisan support.Ms Reeve said large-scale plants would not be suitable for this "last resort" role because they take weeks to switch on and off. If Australia built a large-scale plant, it would be as a replacement for renewables rather than the icing on the cake. And it would almost certainly be more expensive.Tennant Reed from the Australian Industry Group said Australia's energy future almost certainly lies in large-scale solar and wind because it is cheap, abundant and opens doors to developing green export industries.
LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will set out plans to boost Britain's nuclear workforce on Monday, as increased submarine building and the growing needs of the nuclear energy industry are forecast to create 40,000 new jobs by 2030.The government will partner with defence companies BAE Systems (LON:BAES), Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) and Babcock plus energy giant EDF (EPA:EDF) to invest more than 763 million pounds ($961 million) by the end of the decade in skills, jobs and education, it said in a statement.The government needs to ensure there are sufficient nuclear workers to help build and maintain its fleet of submarines, vital for defence and security as they are the basis of the UK's continuous at-sea nuclear deterrent."Safeguarding the future of our nuclear deterrent and nuclear energy industry is a critical national endeavour," said Sunak, who will on Monday visit Barrow-in-Furness in the northwest, where Britain's nuclear submarine industry is based.Further details on how Britain will deliver the capabilities necessary for to maintain its nuclear deterrent will be published by defence secretary Grant Shapps on Monday in the "Defence Nuclear Enterprise Command Paper", Sunak's office said.As part of it plans to boost the nuclear workforce, the government said it will invest 200 million pounds in Barrow over the next decade to help support people into jobs, improve the area's transport infrastructure and build more homes.
Rishi Sunak's visit comes amid concerns the UK isn't spending enough on defence - with no new money pledged in the budget. He says new investment will secure Britain's nuclear deterrent and lower energy costs through nuclear power.Foreign Office minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan and security minister Tom Tugendhat also wrote an article this month calling for a "much greater pace" of investment in light of the threat from countries such as Russia.
The Prime Minister will today [Monday 25th] declare a 'national   endeavour' to secure the future of the UK's thriving defence and civil   nuclear industry, as he visits Barrow-in-Furness and announces a   significant package of investment in skills, jobs and communities.Domestic nuclear capability is vital to our national defence and   energy security, underpinning our nuclear deterrent and securing   cheaper, more reliable energy for UK consumers. The nuclear industry is   growing rapidly, requiring 50% more highly skilled workers in the next   ten years - and we need to train a new generation of British talent.The Government is partnering with industry, including BAE Systems,   Rolls-Royce, EDF and Babcock, to invest at least 763 million by 2030 in   skills, jobs and education. The investment will create more than 8,000   career opportunities to help the sector fill 40,000 new jobs by the end   of the decade - and will support plans to double the number of nuclear   apprentices and graduates and quadruple the number of specialist science   and nuclear fission PhDs.As the home of the UK's Astute-class nuclear submarines - the most   advanced attack submarines ever operated by the Royal Navy - and the new   Dreadnought programme and UK AUKUS submarine production, the Cumbrian   town of Barrow-in-Furness is also central to the UK's defence nuclear   ambitions. The Prime Minister will therefore announce today the   creation of a Barrow Transformation Fund, with the Government committing   an immediate 20 million and a further minimum of 20 million a year   over the next 10 years to make Barrow an even more attractive place to   live, work, and build a nuclear career.Building on these new investments, Defence Secretary Grant Shapps   will later today publish the Government's Defence Nuclear Enterprise   Command Paper, setting out for the first time the full breadth of   activity to sustain andmodernise the UK's continuous at-sea nuclear   deterrent - a cornerstone of national and global security for more than   55 years.That's why we are investing in Barrow, the home   of UK submarines, and in the jobs and skills of the future in the   thriving British nuclear industry. Today we usher in the next generation   of our nuclear enterprise, which will keep us safe, keep our energy   secure, and keep our bills down for good.It is expected to set out how the UK will deliver the capabilities   necessary to maintain our independent nuclear deterrent - including   progressing plans to bring new Dreadnought Class submarines into service   in the early 2030s, deepening cooperation with our partners under the   flagship AUKUS agreement and upgrading key infrastructure - supported by   an additional 3 billion in funding for our nuclear enterprise   announced last year.The UK's ambitious defence plans are underpinned by major new   investment in Barrow. To unlock Barrow's huge potential and support a   growing workforce, the Government will commit an initial 20 million   forimmediate projects, including supporting people towards work,   community projects and completing construction on the A595 Grizebeck   Bypass, and a minimum of 20 million a year over 10 years to improve   health outcomes, build more homes, develop the transport network and   support local schools.Barrow is at the heart of the UK's submarine   enterprise and as the custodian of our submarine design and build   capability, we're incredibly proud of the role we play in the Astute,   Dreadnought and now SSN-AUKUS programmes.The long-term vision set out in the command   paper is hugely welcome and will support the necessary infrastructure   development and recruitment required for the delivery of these important   national security programmes.This is a fantastic opportunity for the UK to   deliver a stronger nuclear industry that will contribute to the   resilience of the UK's independent deterrent and will support the UK's   energy security ambitions and net zero targets. As well as providing   bed-rock support for the ambitious development required across industry   and government for the AUKUS programme.Babcock is proud of the leading role it is   taking in driving forward initiatives to retain and grow the critical   mass of nuclear skills we need today and tomorrow. We have a keen focus   on our major nuclear sites in the South West of England and in Scotland   and are determined to leverage the benefits of the NNSPS, with our   customers and other industry partners, across the broader communities we   serve.EDF welcomes the joint commitments announced   today and looks forward to working with Government and industry to help   deliver the great opportunities for people who choose to work in the   nuclear sector.EDF has been at the heart of the UK's nuclear   energy sector for over 15 years and in 2024 is hiring a further 1,000   people into its UK nuclear family - in operations, construction,   engineering support and many other exciting roles. The majority of these   will be apprentices and graduates, as well as those with relevant   skills from other industries.As we have learned in recent years there is an   urgent need to attract, train and inspire the next generation of people   who can design, build, operate and decommission existing and new nuclear   facilities. We are excited to be part of this national endeavour.As a proud member of the Nuclear Skills Council   and an important partner in the Defence Nuclear Enterprise, we welcome   news that the UK is going to go even further in its mission to meet the   growing demand for nuclear expertise. It is an exciting and fascinating   time for the industry as both civil and defence organisations   collaborate to ensure we all have a strong and sustainable pipeline of   talent coming into the world of nuclear.Nuclear has the power to protect and help meet   the growing demand for clean energy, so news of the UK's commitment to   this unique industry is a sign of its importance. From opening our   Nuclear Skills Academy, which welcomes 200 apprentices every year for at   least the next decade, and our recently announced site expansion work,   which is creating over 1,000 new highly-skilled jobs in Derby, to new   satellite offices creating almost 300 jobs in Glasgow and Cardiff,   Rolls-Royce is playing a pivotal role in supporting this national   endeavour."As part of today's visit, the Prime Minister is expected to meet   apprentices working on the Royal Navy's cutting-edge nuclear submarines.   The UK's nuclear industry is going through an unprecedented period of   growth, driven by the Government's ambitious nuclear energy targets, and   is expected to need 123,000 people by 2030.The investment in nuclear skills - which includes 350 million from   the Government and more than 400m from industry - will create some   5,000 new apprenticeships in the next four years. It will also drive   private investment and create job opportunities for everyone from   specialist scientists and engineers, to welders and electricians, to   project managers and Royal Navy submariners.This follows the major reforms and 60 million worth of investment   outlined by the Prime Minister following the Spring Budget to enable   20,000 more apprenticeships and slash unnecessary regulatory burdens.
