Tech companies have largely focused on powering these through renewable and sustainable energy sources in an effort to boost their green credentials and address climate change. However, increased energy demand caused by the arrival of new technologies like AI is making the task tricky, as this field alone consumes about four times as much power as servers used for cloud applications.According to McKinsey, the power requirements of US data centers are projected to jump from 17 gigawatts (GW) in 2022 to 35 GW by 2030. Electricity isn't the only concern. GPUs used for AI have higher cooling needs than traditional servers, and Microsoft's water usage in data centers rose by 34% in 2022. This figure is expected to surge as the tech giant further increases its investments in AI.Stepping into this role is Erin Henderson, PhD, MBA, PMP, who brings a wealth of experience from her 13-year tenure at the Tennessee Valley Authority, where she served as the General Manager of Transmission Projects.Writing on LinkedIn about her new post, Henderson said "I am very excited to share that I've joined Microsoft in a new role, Director of Nuclear Development Acceleration. Microsoft is leading the way in advocating for a clean and sustainable energy future. I am looking forward to contributing to the datacenter R&D team's success."Wayne Williams is a freelancer writing news for TechRadar Pro.

legislation in early February that would eliminate renewable power objectives within France's energy code, including targets for reducing energy consumption by way of renovating buildings. France24 indicated that the legislation sets no explicit targets for building renewable capacity.Energy Transition Minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher told the weekly newspaper La Tribune Dimanche that the construction of these reactors is necessary to reduce the country's reliance on fossils fuels to 40% from 60% by 2035, admitted in 2021 that nuclear energy was the most reliable energy source, at least on this side of the Atlantic Ocean. Each nuclear reactor typically generates the same amount of power as 431 utility-scale wind turbines or 3.1 million solar panels.study published in the journal Nature Communications indicated, "If future net-zero emissions energy systems rely heavily on solar and wind resources, spatial and temporal mismatches between resource availability and electricity demand may challenge system reliability."The researchers indicated that "the most reliable renewable electricity systems are wind-heavy and satisfy countries' electricity demand in 72-91% of hours ... Yet even in systems which meet >90% of demand, hundreds of hours of unmet demand may occur annually."suggested in a blog post that the bill, which goes before the French cabinet next month, "weakens France's climate objectives, starting with the objective of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. The objective would no longer be to 'reduce' but to tend towards a reduction in 'our greenhouse gas emissions.'"indicated that an increase in French exports of nuclear power to other European nations would likely reduce their dependence on fossil fuels and thereby spare climate alarmists the guilt often associated with winter warmth.Already this year, France has reportedly overseen a three-year high in nuclear generation. From Jan. 2-9, France was an average daily net exporter of over 12.2 gigawatts of power, with roughly 3 gigawatts going to Germany and another six headed to Switzerland, the U.K., and Italy.
The proposed text affirms the sustainable choice of using nuclear energy as a competitive and carbon-free source of electricity, and targets the construction of at least six but as many as 14 new reactors to pull off the transition to clean energy and meet climate change goals.If you only quantify nuclear power, you do not know the share of non-renewable energies. As a result, nuclear gets prioritised and, depending on remaining coverage needs, non-renewables will be the subject of floating (future) decrees. Its no longer a mix, Gosse saidWhat is going through the minds of activists who object to nuclear energy? France already gets most of its electricity from nuclear reactors, it wouldnt take much more capacity for France to get 100% of its electricity from zero carbon nuclear.the author asks, What is going through the minds of activists who object to nuclear energy?One possible answer might be found by following the money. China probably doesnt restrict its political activism to only the US:A climate-focused nonprofitwith significant operations in Beijinghas wired millions of dollars to fund climate initiatives and environmental groups in the U.S., according to tax filings first obtained by Fox News Digital.While the Energy Foundations financial filings indicate that the group is technically headquartered in San Francisco, a Fox News Digital review determined that the majority of its operations are conducted in China with a staff that boasts extensive ties to theChinese Communist Party (CCP). Its recently filed tax form show the group, which refers to itself as Energy Foundation China, contributed $3.8 million to initiatives in the U.S. like phasing out coal and electrifying the transportation sector.The table highlights the nonsense of relying on wind and solar with multiple international interconnections on the premise that the wind always blows and the sun always shines somewhere. Its bitterly cold in Europe at present and they aint letting the U.K. have their juices. In addition, Vlad has certainly mapped exactly where these cables run.When the two major bastions of freedom  the USA and the UK  get decent politicians in power we will fight back as the French are doing, but at the moment we both have liabilities at leadership level and nobody prepared to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  Johnson was not the answer and only ever did half the job.  Trump had them worried, so worried, and we all know what happened as a result.Sadly, the judiciary have moved beyond the well tried and tested truth, whole truth and nothing but the truth. Now we have people being fined and even imprisoned for telling the truth! Those cases are increasing with the prosecution adopting the new legal high ground of, hate crime. The facts are less important now than the emotions of the so called victim?We have had a case in Switzerland of all places, where the defendant quoted directly from the Koran in their defence.  No matter, the court ruled the quoting of what is in the book followed by so many and leading to some awful outcomes was upsetting and risked promoting a public reaction.At the moment its surely looking like a popular vote which has a pretty high percentage for Reform  maybe as much as 15-20%.  Who knows, its rising every week.  But the result of this in the UK political system will probably be a wipeout for the Conservative Party, and a landslide for Labour, but minimal Commons presence for Reform.There are 650 MPs in the Commons.  Depending on how well Reform does, you can imagine the Conservatives falling to under 100, other parties perhaps 100, and Labour with 450 and a 250 seat majority. Could go higher, there have been projections of a Conservative rump of well under 100 MPs.You can imagine Conservatives reduced to 50, at an extreme.  Other remains at 100.  Then you have 500 Labour MPs (helped by the ongoing SNP implosion) and a Labour majority of 350.  Its pretty far out in probability, but its definitely possible.Its quite likely, that in all these scenarios Reform gets at best a couple of seats because their vote is spread across the country and not focused on particular constituencies.  Enough to push the Conservatives out, but not enough to win, so Labour gets in because the conservative vote is split.The chances of any change in UK Net Zero policies as a result of the likely November election seem to be negligible.  All the parties contesting, Conservative, Labour, SNP, Greens, Plaid, Liberals, all of them are committed to Net Zero.I think that given the choice between same old Labour, same old Tory, same old Limp Dumbs, and same old SNP Greens and Plaid Cymru, voting reform is a reasonable alternative to spoiling the ballot paper or simply not bothering to vote at all.The problem for Reform is that its vote is spread out over all constituencies, so the most likely outcome, even if they get into the high twenties, must surely be a Labour landslide.  My scenario with Conservatives reduced to a rump of 50 MPs.Thge 18% is hard to assess.  It doesnt necessarily translate into actual votes on election day, and there are still nine months to go so a lot can change.  But if it carries on, and momentum builds, it is starting to be conceivable that there could be a swing comparable to that in Holland for Wilders, or comparable to the rise of the AfD in Germany.  But Holland is proportional representation, so the outcome will be very different.I still think that in this scenario a Labour majority of 200+ is the most likely outcome.  I cant really see Reform getting to enough seats to be a force in Parliament.  But one interesting possibility is the effect on public feeling if they were to get (say) 30% of the vote and 5-10 seats.  I dont know how likely it is, but imagine a wild result something like this:I dont know how plausible or likely anything like this is, but if it happened surely the effects on public opinion would be extreme?  Im not sure the country would accept it.  Though what they would do about it?The British government has launched a roadmap for reaching its ambition for the UK to have 24 GWe of nuclear generating capacity by 2050, representing about 25% of the countrys projected electricity demand.The ultimate goal for them though is still an irrational one. Nuclear is fine for base load power, but you also need coal and gas as well to be able to respond to the daily and weather-related fluctuations in demand. The fantasy still seems to be that Ruinables can replace coal and gas, and that is just dream world craziness.NuScale, probably close to bankruptcy, has a SMR design that put safety in the form of automatic no power input required shutdown systems and variable output capability to provide for unreliable output of unreliables.The North Anna site was originally licensed for 2 more units never built. In 2017 it received a license to build a safer design for a third plant. I am sure way more expensive to build that the original Westinghouse design.NOW, both Virginia plants use open source fresh water for cooling, Surry using the James River and N. Anna using a Lake Anna built on the North Anna River to provide the cooling, so no cooling towers for added expenses.Nope, the ultimate goal is to launder taxpayers money through the green gristmill to the leftist politicians who run much of the western countries today, and the leftists NGO who help those politicians control the MSM and social media dialogue and, thus, help the selfsame politicians get elected.Notwithstanding recent maintenance issues with about half of Frances 59 nuclear fleet, they have been supplying about 80% of demand, the balance being hydro, geothermal, natural gas (from North Africa), and 2  3% wind/solar and a wave machine.That meant that much of the rural population  a large part of the French population  used wood stoves, oil, LPG for heating and wood stoves and bottled gas for cooking.  Electricity was mostly for lights, TV, refrigerator and small appliances.There was no rationale nor logic for France to subsidise and install wind and solar to replace its nuclear fleet  the target at the time was to replace a third of nuclear output with wind and solar  other than the nonsense that nuclear was not a renewable (which it is, as spent fuel rods are reprocessed) and not carbon neutral.After the European idiots cut themselves off from Russian gas and panic ensued, Emperor Macronavirus saw the light, and realised France with mostly nuclear electricity was self-dependent, not at risk of geopolitical shenanigans.It is true France uses a lot of motor fuels. It is a large Country  much less urbanised compared to the UK for example  with a large scattered rural population, making reliance for most on bus services or trains impossible.  Motor transportation is vital for distribution of food and goods, farming, small business and private use.Trying to electrify the road/vehicle system, given the geography and demography, is neigh impossible on practical and cost grounds. I cannot see the France responding well to the banning of ICE vehicles or any further attempts to carbon tax motor fuels, particularly diesel on which France mostly runs.Correction: piped gas was confined to cities and big towns but not any more. I can only answer directly for the southern part of Burgundy but I am assured that the areas not on the gas grid are now largely those dpartements where the exercise would be so costly as to make it counter-productive. Isolated farms and hamlets still rely on bottled gas as do similar dwellings in most European countries.As for EVs, youre right enough. There are certainly areas where they would not be a cost-effective option. At the same time France sees itself still as a largely rural country (which it is!) and every French citizen is entitled as far as possible to the same rights as every other French citizen. Which means that France will tailor its climate commitments to its own circumstances as far as that is practicable.Heating and Evaporating the Water:(145 million metric ton x {(22 C seawater heated to 100 C = 78 C delta T) x (4186 J/kg-C = 326508 J/kg ) + (40650 J/18 g mole x 1000 = 2258333 J/kg)} =0.3774 exajoulesThe strong El Nio of late 2023, coincided with increased lower-atmosphere temperatures of about 0.30 C, that were augmented by the after effects of theHunga Tongavolcaniceruption in January 2022. See Images 1 and 7Every once in a while we see a glimmer of hope when, apparently accidentally, a prominent leader chooses policy that is actually based on the universe we live in, and not on some drug induced dream of unicorn farts and pixie dust.If France builds at least six nuclear plants there obviously is no need for any more wind or solar. It is wind and solar that send us backward not nuclear. These renewable gangsters need to take a hike.At last there is a general realisation dawning that Net Zero and several other doom-laden climate fantasy forecasts that are, in reality, utter nonsense and a HUGE waste of money  promoted of course by those who want to beggar the economies of Western Countries..  We see this fight-back in the UK (at last) with the UK government reopening some North Sea Oil  reserves  so allowing us to combat the many excessive and past ill-considered so-called green initiatives.  We need scientific reality and not manipulated temperature records (as currently seen in the USA) driving our future.

Sam Altman is a major investor in Helion Energy an American-based fusion research company and together, they are trying to build the first nuclear fusion power plant. If they succeed in doing so, they will be the first to put this technology to practical use.In May 2023, Microsoft signed a power purchase agreement with Helion, confirming that theyll buy electricity from them in 2028. This gives the company almost 4 years to bring the project to life by which it aims to build a 50MW nuclear fusion power plant.As of now, OpenAI gets hundreds of millions of queries every single day which approximately takes up 1GWh of energy on a daily basis. This is equivalent to the amount of energy used by 33,000 households in the US.And this breakthrough seems very possible now that companies are relying on AI to grow their business. Their own needs are motivating them to heavily invest in renewable energy sources like nuclear fusion and solar energy.Sam Altman has already invested $375 million in Helion Energy and seems pretty confident of meeting their 2028 deadline. If this project successfully goes through, itll not only benefit Helion but also catapult OpenAIs growth and give it an edge over its competitors.Krishi is an eager Tech Journalist and content writer for both B2B and B2C, with a focus on making the process of purchasing software easier for businesses and enhancing their online presence and SEO.

The fund plans to invest in the expansion of clean energy, accelerate sustainable solutions and technologies, and help companies within carbon-intensive sectors transition to more sustainable business practices. Its seed portfolio reportedly includes an onshore renewables developer in the United Kingdom and a solar partnership in India.Brookfield also expresses plans to achieve a larger fundraiser than its previous transition fund. The Canadian companys first fund closed at $15 billion in June of 2022, becoming the largest fund of its kind in the world. Investments from that first financing round are currently going toward renewable power, business transformation, carbon capture and storage, renewable natural gas, and nuclear services.We have demonstrated beyond doubt the breadth and scale of attractive investment opportunities in the transition to a net zero economy, said Mark Carney, chair and head of transition investing for Brookfield. By going where the emissions are, the Brookfield Global Transition Fund strategy is aiming to deliver strong risk-adjusted financial returns for investors and make meaningful environmental impacts for people and the planet.In November 2023, Brookfield and Cameco jointly acquired global nuclear giant, Westinghouse, citing a lasting demand outlook for nuclear power. Westinghouse is the core service provider for over 50% of the worlds operating nuclear reactors. The company has also developed small modular reactors and other next-generation advanced reactors, which are expected to drive future nuclear energy development.Despite mixed opinions on nuclear powers role in the clean energy transition, the industry has been identified as a major contributor to meeting global electricity demand through clean energy sources.Nuclear is currently the second largest global source of clean energy after hydropower, and the International Energy Agency expects nuclear energy generation to reach an all-time global high by early 2025 to meet this rising demand. The U.K. also released plans earlier this year to increase nuclear generation by up to four times its current amounts, making the energy source a key piece of its overall decarbonization strategy.

The European Green Party wants to move up its timeline for attaining net-zero emissions from 2050 to 2040, but the German Greens are advocating for a 2045 target date and seeking to cut out calls to end the use of natural gas by 2035 and oil by 2040, according to Euractiv. The German Greens are part of the countrys governing coalition, which has seen its popularity plummet as the countrys economy has performed poorly amid a prolonged energy crisis.The 2045 target date is already a part of the German Greens platform, but the timelines for oil and gas phaseouts are points of contention between the German party and the wide European institution, according to Euractiv.(RELATED: Germany Says Nuclear Energy Is Dangerous, Slams EU For Labeling It Sustainable)Germany closed its last remaining nuclear plants in April 2023 to complement its massive green energy spending blitz, even as the German economy was deteriorating as soaring energy costs undermined its industrial base, according to Politico.The meager economic outlook and energy crisis is also shaking up German politics. German farmers recently conducted a week-long wave ofprotest across the country in response to the governments plan to cut crucial agricultural subsidies to plug a massive budget gap and fund green initiatives.The Alternative for Germany (AfD), the countrys right-wing populist party, has seen its popularity more than double since the Russian invasion of Ukraine started in February 2022, according to polling data from Politico. About 80% of the German population is unsatisfied with the current governing coalition, and more than half of the country wants elections before 2025, the currently scheduled date, accordingto Bloomberg News.So much wild stuff continues to be downstream of Germanys insane nuclear phaseout in the face of not only the energy crisis but also the EUs own climate goals. German Greens, part of a deeply unpopular coalition government, want a longer fossil phasedown to keep nuclear offline, Mark Nelson, the founder and managing director of Radiant Energy Group, an energy consultancy, wrote in a post to X. This is because if they lose power too soon, their now-unpopular enforcement of Germanys nuclear shutdown could be reversed as several reactors remain in pristine condition and a new German government without the Greens could quickly turn them back on.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Think back to 1986 and 2011. If youre a seasoned uranium futures trader, you will know the significance of these years, although most people wont have a clue. If the current trend in uranium continues, 2024 could be another historic year for a commodity thats usually under the radar but is suddenly popping up in the headlines.To recap, the Chernobyl nuclear meltdown took place in Russia (the Soviet Union, at that time) in 1986, and the Fukushima nuclear disaster occurred in Japan in 2011. Those two terrible incidents gave nuclear energy a bad rap, as the saying goes.We can debate all day long whether this bad rap is deserved or not, but todays focus will be on investment opportunities. Is there value now in recently explosive uranium stocks? Thats the billion-dollar question, so lets start by taking stock of recent moves in the spot uranium price, which will naturally affect all uranium-market stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in 2024.To understand whats going on in the sphere of uranium and nuclear energy, youll have to look outside of North America. It wont be much of a pleasure trip, but when conducting your due diligence, you have to go wherever the action is.Our first stopover will be in France, which hasnt traditionally been amenable to nuclear-power proliferation. Indeed, France has been among the vanguard nations that promote solar, wind and other clean-energy sources.However, France may be on the cusp of redefining clean energy sources to include nuclear power. Tough times require a certain measure of flexibility, but Frances recent about-face concerning nuclear energy is practically unheard of.Believe it or not, a high-profile pro-nuclear bill is currently working its way through the French governments highest levels. The bill would provide for six to 14 new nuclear reactors and promotes the sustainable choice of usingnuclear energyas a competitive and carbon-free electricity source.Theres no guarantee that this bill will become the law of the land, but its a sign that governments in Europe and elsewhere may turn to nuclear power to shore up their energy independence. Yet, while global demand for uranium may soon be on the rise, its the supply side of the equation thats really sending the spot uranium price soaring.Now its time to visit Eastern Europes Kazakhstan, where NAC Kazatomprom, the largest producer of uranium on the planet, warned that it will be difficult to achieve its 2024 and 2025 goals for uranium production. The company didnt update its production guidance, but it did observe challenges in sourcing the necessary sulfuric acid to extract uranium.Thus, weve learned two things on our unusual two-stop jaunt. First, the global demand for uranium could increase if typically reluctant governments change their stances on nuclear power. Second, a key uranium producer probably wont meet its previously stated production targets.These factors were evidently enough to push the spot uranium price above $100 not long ago. The exact price is a constantly moving target, but uranium watchers lit up social media on Monday with breathy posts like this one:When it comes to buying commodity-related stocks and ETFs, whats more important than how is the question of how much. Im certainly not against the idea of buying uranium stocks and funds now, but any and all position sizes should be very small.Consequently, investors might consider starting off with a few shares of the Global X Uranium ETF (NYSEARCA:URA) and the Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:URNM) for general uranium-market exposure. To that, they can add a handful of shares of Canada-based Cameco (NYSE:CCJ) and U.S.-headquartered Uranium Energy Corp. (NYSEAMERICAN:UEC).Disclaimer: All investments involve risk.

On Tuesday, the two start-ups announced they were joining forces to "support the industrial, technological, scientific and regulatory deployment" of fourth-generation nuclear reactors, known as advanced modular reactors (AMRs), they said on a press release. [Shutterstock]UK company Newcleo and French company NAAREA are set to form a strategic partnership to accelerate the development of their fourth-generation nuclear technologies, the two announced in an interview with Euractiv France, AFP and Le Figaro on Tuesday (16 January).On Tuesday, the two start-ups announced they were joining forces to support the industrial, technological, scientific and regulatory deployment of fourth-generation nuclear reactors, known as advanced modular reactors (AMRs), they said in a statement.While NAAREA is developing a molten salt-fast neutron nuclear micro-generator capable of producing 40 MW of electricity and 80 MW of heat, Newcleo is developing two concepts for lead-cooled mini-fast reactors (30 MW and 200 MW).As the European Commission prepares to launch its industry alliance for small modular reactors, Euractiv France takes a closer look at the groups planned structure, work programme and remaining grey areas.Although these areas of work are very different, the two manufacturers teams are already working together in some, particularly in research, an area where there has perhaps been less contact, David Briggs, deputy managing director of NAAREA, said in an interview on Tuesday.According to him, This partnership could even provide a joint research base at the European level in collaboration with the Sustainable Nuclear Energy Technology Platform (SNETP), a centre of exchange and influence on nuclear energy in Europe.The European Parliament backed the development of small nuclear reactors (SMRs) on Tuesday (12 December), a move welcomed by EU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson, who has already called for a rapid turnaround of EU initiatives on the matter.France will have more than tripled its imports of Russian industrial nuclear products between 2021 and 2022, making it he EUs leading importer of such products, according to a study by Polish think tank Forum Energii, which raises questions about the EUs ability to weaning itself from Russian resources.As proof of this, NAAREA and Newcleo are both winners of the Innovative Nuclear Reactors call for projects under the France 2030 investment plan, which has earmarked 1 billion for the nuclear industry.At the same time, the SMR Alliance, announced by the EU Commission in December, could provide an opportunity to lobby for ImportantProject of Common European Interests (IPCEI) in this field along the lines of other alliances: battery, solar, hydrogen and others.France and Czechia reiterated calls on Tuesday (9 January) for the European Commission to put nuclear power on an equal footing with renewable energies in all EU policies, putting traditional nuclear sceptic countries on the defensive.

In this article, we take a look at the 15 worst industrial disasters in the world. If you want to, you can skip our detailed robotics industry analysis and go directly to our shorter list of the 5 worst industrial disasters in the world.Industrial disasters are accidents that occur in industrial companies due to failure, negligence, or incompetence in handling chemical, mechanical, civil, electrical, or other processes. Since an industrial disaster involves dangerous chemicals and hazardous substances, it is a significant threat not just to humans, but also to the natural and infrastructural environment.Today, the industrial sector takes up a large portion of the world economy, making up 17.9% of the GDP of the United States, which is the largest economy in the world as of 2024. Over the decades, the industrial sector has maintained its position in the world economy. A detailed analysis of this conducted by the Industrial Analytics Platform further emphasizes the close link between industrial activities, economic growth, and sustainable development, and how industrial development will take a whole new level in the years to come.Given the importance of the industrial sector, it is also important to note that if the balance is tipped, there can be a significant impact on the world economy. Throughout history, weve seen multiple times how industrial disasters trigger huge economic losses and destabilize sustainable growth.Industrial disasters concern not just the manufacturing industries, but others as well. In 2022, the chemical industrys total revenue, on a global level, stood at around USD 5.72 trillion, reaching the highest value in the last 15 years. The chemical industry is growing at an exponential rate, but a minor negligence or failure involving chemicals like in the Bhopal Gas Tragedy can lead to a catastrophe.Similar to the chemical industry, the nuclear industry, which is responsible for generating 10% of the worlds electricity according to the World Nuclear Association, is also prone to disasters. For instance, in 2011, the Fukushima disaster in Japan was an eye-opener for many countries with nuclear energy plants. It dealt a heavy blow to Japan's economy, with its share of nuclear energy dropping from 29.2% in 2010-11 to 2.1% in 2012.Fortunately, the industrial sector continues to learn from past disasters and implement more safety precautions to safeguard the future. As world technology progresses, industrial workplace safety is enhanced and the risk of disasters is also minimized. One of the most effective solutions has been the incorporation of robotics technology as it can perform repetitive tasks faster and with much higher accuracy and precision than human workers.For the same reason, using robots and automating industrial manufacturing has been a growing trend in recent years. In 2023, there were around 4.09 million units of service robotics and 450 thousand units of industrial robots worldwide. (See: 15 Biggest Robotics Companies in the World). While human workers are still needed in industrial manufacturing, robots and machines can be used to handle hazardous chemicals and dangerous tasks to minimize industrial disasters.Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, economic growth has mainly come at the expense of the environment. While economies, populations, and resource demands grow continuously, the availability of resources remains the same, therefore urging industrial companies to adopt strategies in the modern world to uplift economies without exhausting natural resources.From human-centered processes to machine-reliant assembly lines to highly automated factories, industrial companies are adapting to new trends and transforming their methods. Some of the main reasons for adapting to new trends are to minimize the risk of disasters, improve efficiency, lower costs, and reduce material wastage.Some industrial companies are already incorporating Industry 4.0 in their manufacturing processes. For instance, HIROTEC Corporation, a major automotive supplier, uses the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) for operational intelligence and predicting maintenance in its manufacturing machines and assets.Some of the key players in the manufacturing companies are Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE: TM), Samsung Electronics (KSE: 005930), and BASF SE (ETR: BAS). All these industrial companies are well-aligned with Industry 4.0 and use it in their process management. In fact, in 2017, Apple partnered with GE to bring iOS into Industry 4. In 2023, Apple took more initiatives including the first Smart Manufacturing Forum for SMBs in South Korea, to showcase its serious involvement in the fourth industrial revolution.Over the years, Apple has invested millions of dollars in automation technology, and it is not the only one. Today, all industrial companies are prioritizing technology and development to reduce the risk of disasters and become the key players in their sector. At the same time, they acknowledge that automation technology cannot replace the skill of human workers even Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) did, in their conversation with The Information.For our list of the worst industrial disasters in the world, we analyzed a list of notable industrial disasters in the world and shortlisted the ones that incurred the most damage to human life and/or the economy. We ranked disasters based on the number of deaths caused by the disaster, going from the least to the highest. Weve also discussed financial and industrial losses caused by each disaster.By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

Still, many people were injured. This disaster took place in Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire, near the M1 motorway.The aftermath included a hefty cleanup, destroyed properties, and around 1 billion in damage. Total UK, Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd, and the British Pipeline Agency (BPA) were all fined after this disaster.On 10 July 1976, a chemical reactor exploded in the ICMESA plant located near Seveso, Italy. The disaster killed 3,000 farm animals immediately and left people with terrible health disorders. The explosion caused dioxins to leak into the area.While no human lives were lost as a result of the explosion, over 70,000 animals were euthanized to make sure no one would get harmed by the chemicals. To this day, the Seveso area is off-limits for any development.In the aftermath of this disaster, Seveso experienced financial consequences due to environmental damage, decreased property value, livestock loss, and agricultural loss. Healthcare costs also increased because of skin diseases caused by chemicals.The Deepwater Horizon Explosion of 2010 is known as one of the most significant oil spills and one of the worst industrial disasters in history. As a result of this disaster, 11 people lost their lives and 17 got severely injured.The Deepwater Horizon rig is owned by BP PLC (NYSE: BP), a leading oil company. According to a report published by BP, the explosion was a result of many causes all of which contributed to a wellhead explosion, the release of natural gas, and its eventual ignition at the rig. After the explosion, 1000 barrels of oil leaked into the ocean daily for 85.5 days.BP had to pay compensation of $20 million to the victims and families of those who lost their loved ones. A lot of damage was caused by this explosion, including thousands of marine animals dying. This explosion also left many people unemployed due to the lack of tourism in the petroleum-laden areas.Another tragic chemical explosion, the Texas city refinery disaster, was the result of a vapor cloud of chemicals catching on fire. One hundred eighty workers were heavily injured, and 15 lost their lives. This took place at a BP refinery in Texas when a vapor cloud exploded in its isomerization process unit.BP PLC (NYSE: BP) was sued for an environmental crime and charged a $50 million fine. BP PLC (NYSE: BP) also had to pay around $1.6 billion to compensate the victims. These continued until 2009 when OSHA charged BP a whopping $87 million fine.The deadly Phillips Disaster took place in 1989 when high-flammable gasses caused multiple explosions at the Phillips Petroleum Company (NYSE: PSX). Twenty-three people were killed and 314 were injured. The fire lasted for 10 hours, damaging water pipes and making it harder to put out.The Chernobyl disaster of 1986 is one of the most known industrial disasters and even inspired a $40 million show by HBO. The miniseries depicted the atrocities of the disaster and helped create awareness regarding industrial disasters. It is available to watch on Apple TV+(NASDAQ: AAPL) as well. The disaster took 50 lives and has left the entire area radioactive and inhabitable to this day. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone will be habitable again in 20,000 years.In April 1986, an explosion occurred at a Chernobyl nuclear plant. Perhaps the worst nuclear disaster to ever exist, over $68 billion was spent to help with migration. Chernobyl is still radioactive, although some residents have returned to their homes.There was a direct loss of $12.6 billion on the economic side. Around 784,320 hectares of land were destroyed, and food production in the area was banned. The disaster also caused significant electrical loss in places like Ukraine.The Xiangshui chemical plant produced chemicals such as pesticides and other organic compounds and has since shut down. Like the other disasters mentioned on this list, the plant ignored waste management and safety regulations warnings. Not only did they choose to ignore them, but there had also been previous fires at this plant.In March 2019, an explosion took place, killing 78 people and destroying buildings nearby. The Xiangshui chemical plant was shut down soon after, and the district faces a property loss of around $100 million. There was also an economic loss of about $284.3 million.The Centralia Mine Disaster is known as the second-worst mining disaster in the US, killing over 100 people. It took place in Centralia, Pennsylvania on 25 March 1947. The disaster started off with the electricity being cut off and thick black smoke surging through the mines. This then led to a large accumulation of smoke and a deadly explosion.Poor safety regulations and coal dust caused this tragic explosion. Out of 142 men, only 31 managed to escape. The mine had received previous warnings about the coal dust that was collecting, but they chose to ignore it.Some economic consequences faced after this disaster were compensation for victims, recovery investments, and safety regulations. According to a report by the UN, there was a temporary decline in coal production after the disaster.The Beirut explosion is one of the most recent industrial disasters caused by an ammonium nitrate explosion in the capital of Lebanon. There were more than 200 deaths and 7000 injuries resulting from the incident which took place in 2020. This explosion was the cause of large amounts of ammonium nitrate that had been stored in a warehouse without proper security measures. Lebanese authorities believe that welding work was what resulted in a fire which then led to the explosion.While some time has passed, Beirut still hasn't recovered from the explosion. Not only did this disaster weaken the local currency and push millions into poverty, but it also wrecked necessary infrastructure like ports. The economic loss caused by this incident was around $15 billion, with $3 billion going into infrastructure restoration. With the port destroyed, there was a lack of exports and imports, which the country relied on.In December 2003, PetroChinas Chuandongbei natural gas field exploded in the municipality of Chongqing, China, killing more than 233 people and injuring over 10,000, putting it sixth on our list of the worst industrial disasters in the world. The blast was at such a catastrophic level that it nearly wiped out an entire village and caused other widespread damages.While there isnt much information about how much PetroChina (HKSE: 0857) paid compensation regarding this case, there most likely would have been rescuing operation costs, property damages, and compensation for blast victims.
"Consumers who heat with electricity and live in E.ON's basic supply area have so far been able to benefit from relatively low prices for the basic heating electricity supply despite the energy crisis. But that will soon be over," said the North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) consumer advice center. The notice period is two weeks after the firm has been provided with existing customers in the Alternative Tariff Offer. NRW also gave important tips for those who wanted to leave. "Since the choice of heating electricity [rates] is smaller than with household electricity, we recommend that you first allow a longer contract term of up to 24 months in the filter settings. However, a shorter maturity of only twelve months is recommended," Mueller explained as per the English-translated site. "To find a suitable heating electricity [rate], consumers need to know how the heating current is measured in them, which means which electricity meters are installed." She also said that it would make sense to ask local providers about rate options because not all rates options would be found on the comparison portals. The rate at which electrical energy is supplied to a consumer is known as a tariff. Although tariffs should include the total cost of producing and supplying electrical energy plus the profit, they cannot be the same for all types of consumers. Meanwhile, reports claimed that Germany's gas supply situation has become better than it was after Russia cut off supply last winter. E.ON's boss insisted that the instability in the Middle East is the reason why energy prices are soaring. "It would take a lot for there to be gas shortages this winter," CEO Leonhard Birnbaum told the Rheinische Post newspaper, noting stores were full and China, the largest buyer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), was now buying less. And because much of the LNG which Germany now relies upon comes from the Gulf, instability there would have an impact, he noted. "If there is an escalation, that would have an impact on all energy markets," he said. "They are more interwoven than before: not only the oil price but also gas and electricity prices. The Persian Gulf is the central route for oil and LNG." Birnbaum added that there was no prospect of Germany's decommissioned nuclear plants ever being reactivated, something opposition politicians have called for since Isar 2, Germany's last plant, was switched off in April. "Isar 2 won't go back online," he said. "It's already being dismantled. It's no longer even technically possible."

The move is claimed to be part of the expansion of public and private charging infrastructure for electric vehicles across Germany and Europe. At the new site in Essen, E.ON is testing and researching charging solutions on an area of around 10,000 square meters. The test lab has 25 stations and digital test environments are available for testing vehicles, charging stations, wallboxes and accessories. It also has five special climate chambers that allow E.ON engineers to simulate all temperature conditions that occur around the world, from freezing cold to extreme heat. "Energy transition, clean transport, climate protection, all this will only succeed if electromobility gains even more momentum. We will build at least 1,000 additional public charging stations across Europe every year, further accelerating the transformation of traffic and transport. With our new test and innovation center, we are creating the necessary capacity to meet the growing demand for charging infrastructure. As a result, we are ideally positioned for the dynamic market development of electric mobility," E.ON Board Member Patrick Lammers said. According to Petrol Plaza, E.ON's test lab is the only facility in Europe where fast charging in heavy-duty vehicles can be tested with up to three megawatts of power. The company plans to build at least 1,000 new ultra-fast charging stations per year in its European markets. In Germany, E.ON will build around 140 new charging locations with more than 1,200 charging points for the federally subsidized German network, making it one of the largest operators of the nationwide fast-charging network. This is in addition to the charging infrastructure E.ON is building for its customers across Europe.

In Germany, E.ON will build around 140 new charging locations with more than 1,200 charging points for the federally subsidized German network, making it one of the largest operators of the nationwide fast-charging network. This is in addition to the charging infrastructure E.ON is building for its customers across Europe.

"Since the choice of heating electricity [rates] is smaller than with household electricity, we recommend that you first allow a longer contract term of up to 24 months in the filter settings. However, a shorter maturity of only twelve months is recommended," Mueller explained as per the English-translated site. "To find a suitable heating electricity [rate], consumers need to know how the heating current is measured in them, which means which electricity meters are installed." She also said that it would make sense to ask local providers about rate options because not all rates options would be found on the comparison portals. The rate at which electrical energy is supplied to a consumer is known as a tariff. Although tariffs should include the total cost of producing and supplying electrical energy plus the profit, they cannot be the same for all types of consumers. Meanwhile, reports claimed that Germany's gas supply situation has become better than it was after Russia cut off supply last winter. E.ON's boss insisted that the instability in the Middle East is the reason why energy prices are soaring. "It would take a lot for there to be gas shortages this winter," CEO Leonhard Birnbaum told the Rheinische Post newspaper, noting stores were full and China, the largest buyer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), was now buying less. And because much of the LNG which Germany now relies upon comes from the Gulf, instability there would have an impact, he noted. "If there is an escalation, that would have an impact on all energy markets," he said. "They are more interwoven than before: not only the oil price but also gas and electricity prices. The Persian Gulf is the central route for oil and LNG." Birnbaum added that there was no prospect of Germany's decommissioned nuclear plants ever being reactivated, something opposition politicians have called for since Isar 2, Germany's last plant, was switched off in April. "Isar 2 won't go back online," he said. "It's already being dismantled. It's no longer even technically possible."

The move is claimed to be part of the expansion of public and private charging infrastructure for electric vehicles across Germany and Europe. At the new site in Essen, E.ON is testing and researching charging solutions on an area of around 10,000 square meters. The test lab has 25 stations and digital test environments are available for testing vehicles, charging stations, wallboxes and accessories. It also has five special climate chambers that allow E.ON engineers to simulate all temperature conditions that occur around the world, from freezing cold to extreme heat. "Energy transition, clean transport, climate protection, all this will only succeed if electromobility gains even more momentum. We will build at least 1,000 additional public charging stations across Europe every year, further accelerating the transformation of traffic and transport. With our new test and innovation center, we are creating the necessary capacity to meet the growing demand for charging infrastructure. As a result, we are ideally positioned for the dynamic market development of electric mobility," E.ON Board Member Patrick Lammers said.

The draft manifesto, dated 12 January and currently under negotiations with party members, is likely to be approved at the EPPs political assembly on 29-30 January before the electoral congress in Bucharest in early March. [Shutterstock/Alexandros Michailidis]A draft electoral manifesto of the EU centre-right European Peoples Party (EPP) seen by Euractiv suggests cutting down on EU bureaucracy in key policy areas such as tech, stating we want to enable, develop, and utilise AI, not contain it or hinder it. It also echoes mounting complaints from across the bloc about overregulation in environmental, agricultural and social policy.While the 2024 EU election agenda of the largest political party in the European Parliament, also the political home to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, remains focused on law and order, it also calls for a fight against Brussels red tape.The draft manifesto, dated 12 January and currently under negotiations with party members, will likely be approved at the EPPs political assembly on 29-30 January before the electoral congress in Bucharest in early March.Legislation needs to be user-friendly and easy to understand, and it must be implemented. We will reduce old bureaucracy by introducing a 1 in, 2 out; principle with an overall objective of reducing the regulatory burden by a third, through a specific action plan, the draft reads.On technology, the EPP vouches for artificial intelligence but not artificial bureaucracy, adding that we want to enable, develop, and utilise AI, not contain it or hinder it through over-regulation.On agriculture, they vouch to eliminate excessive requirements for farmers, attributing the bureaucratic burden to increased green legislation: This applies in particular to issues such as new rules on the sustainable use of plant protection products (SUR), the document reads.The 2019 manifesto also strongly focused on combating climate change, but, unlike the 2024 version reviewed by Euractiv, it gave prominence to the need to balance economic development with the environment, urging to significantly reduce the environmental impacts of our economy.The lack of mentions of environmental protection is consistent with recent declarations from German MEP Peter Liese, the EPPs spokesperson in the Parliaments environment committee, who said the top political priority at the moment was to fight climate change and ensure industries in Europe have access to affordable clean energy.Following EPPs impetus to become the farmers party, the manifesto strongly prioritises boosting the sector to secure food production and farmers jobs over climate protection and biodiversity, in a clear hint againstthe nature restoration law.The most concrete proposal on fisheries is the call for a better focus on this sector through a stand-alone portfolio on fisheries in the next European Commission. Currently, the portfolio is environment, oceans, and fisheries, held by Commissioner Virginijus Sinkeviius.On energy and climate, the EPP put together a catch-all programme that tries to please everyone. Yet, what transpires is an attempt to rebalance the priorities of the Green Deal to focus on Europes economic competitiveness and re-industrialisation: Without climate protection, our economy cannot remain competitive in the long term, but without a competitive economy, there can be no sustainable climate protection either.The EPP advocates a technology-neutral approach to climate policy, saying it will support all renewable energies equally  meaning not just solar and wind but also geothermal, hydropower, and liquid and solid biomass (e.g. wood).As for nuclear energy, the EPP says it supports it where and when it makes sense. Whats clear is that the EPP will oppose bans on any kind of technology, including polluting ones: We reject a ban policy  such as the ban on combustion engines  and will also revise it as soon as possible.To strengthen the EUs external borders, EPP proposes to triple the amount of Frontex staff to 30,000. In 2019, the party proposed to expand the EUs border agency to 10,000 employees, though it is currently at around 2,000.On security, the draft proposes to increase Europols workforce from 650 to 3.000 to fight against organised crime and terrorism, as well as violence against women, a new addition from 2019s manifesto.The draft also contains a call for a European convention to improve EU treaties but, rather than to boost the integration of competencies, to review which ones should be possibly transferred back [to member states].

The National Rally Against Reckless Renewables is on the first sitting day of Parliament, Tuesday, 6th February 2024, at 10am in front of Parliament House. This peaceful rally is grassroots, representing many diverse regional communities who are directly and adversely affected by the Australian Governments reckless rollout of renewables. We urge the Federal and State Governments to cease their reckless rollout of unreliable, unaffordable, and environmentally destructive wind, solar, limited firming batteries, and high-voltage transmission lines, amidst an ever-increasing demand for reliable electricity.Currently, there are over 1000 new renewable projects in the governments Powering Our Nation pipeline (Source AEMO, 2023). Almost all of these are located in Regional Australia. In the lead-up to most of these projects, this government has conducted short, insincere, and unacknowledged community consultation. Exploiting the fact that most of these projects are located in or near coastal, farming, and traditional communities with small populations, the government continues to disregard our concerns. In many cases, our right to judicial review or appeal has or will be removed.Australian consumers, taxpayers, and industries require an electricity network that is efficient, safe, reliable, secure, and affordable. It is critical for Australia, now and in the future, to establish a network that does not damage our unique environment, particularly productive agricultural land, fisheries, and native habitats.This governments reckless rollout of renewables poses a significant threat to our nation, threatening food production for Australians and 80 million consumers globally. Our fauna and flora are facing unprecedented destruction, as hundreds of thousands of hectares of land and ocean floors are being deforested and/or damaged. It is posing a threat to our economy, costing over $121 billion (AEMO, 2023). There are documented serious supply chain and sustainment issues, and therefore reliability risks, potentially leading to mass blackouts. Massive taxpayer subsidies and electricity bills will flow offshore for decades to the many greenwashed multinationals lined up for these subsidised investments.This rally is a coalition of grassroots community groups united under the National Rational Energy Network. We call upon the Australian Government to:1. Conduct an urgent Senate Inquiry: Establish a Senate Inquiry to scrutinise the technical veracity as well as the excessive economic, social and environmental costs of renewables, and the escalating risks to our national interest and security. This includes reviewing the committed, anticipated, actionable and future projects being fast-tracked by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment, and Water, in particular the Capacity Investment Scheme, Rewiring the Nation, Offshore Wind Projects, and expanding unelected overreaching organisations including the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, Climate Change Authority, Clean Energy Finance Corporation, Australian Energy Market Operator, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, and Clean Energy Council.2. Suspend all renewable energy projects: We call on the Australian Government to convene the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) Energy Council and request all states and territories suspend wind, solar, hydro and associated transmission construction until the above Senate Inquiry reports.3. Lift the ban on nuclear power: Nuclear energy has the lowest overall greenhouse gas emissions of any energy source as a result of its low land footprint, low material usage, and low waste output. The current ban is archaic, restraining Australia from achieving a strong reliable energy future.This is a national grassroots call for a responsible and sustainable approach to our energy future. We urge the Australian government to prioritise the well- being of our environment, communities, and the future of our nation.[10.00am Mr Grant Piper] [10.10am Ms Gemma Pride] [10.20am Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price] [10.30am Mr Craig Kelly] [10.40am Senator Ralph Babet] [10.50am Senator Ross Cadell] [11.00am Hon Barnaby Joyce MP] [11.10am The Hon Dr David Gillespie MP] [11.20 Senator the Hon.

Aboriginals speaking about desecration of sacred land during the building wind turbines are about as welcome in Aussie mainstream media as black power people supporting Trump are in the US mainstream media.Jacinta Price is one of Australias star politicians. She and her mother Bess Price (and families) are from Alice Springs and deserve high-praise for standing resolutely on principles that have nothing to do with race.No Bill, Jacinta is an evil Alt White and does not correctly represent the traditional owners who have had 100,000 years of perfect harmony on this continent which clearly involved sustainable farming in large permanent towns and had nothing to do with killing off all the megafauna and/or burning down so much of the forests that the rainfall patterns changed. Clearly.Did we get the Completely Unrelated Third Party Who No One Has Heard Of Before Or Invited that can march up in neo 1930s Euro cosplay and decisively prove to the MSM that the entire rally was funded by. (gasp) the Alt Right!! ?5- 30 meters deep) sea sponge. (A meaning from a limited sampled area a small part part of, NOT the whole Caribbean. My beach collected sponge spicules are all shallow origin.) Down where we already know thermocline temperatures are affected by ocean currents. And where we also know sea sponge spicule chemistry is at best a sketchy proxy for temperature alonewhich is why previously sea sponges almost never were used before as a temp proxy. Not even by Mann, Marcott, or Pages2.Novel but sketchy narrow geographic proxy extrapolated to usual alarmist global result. Very climate sciency. Alarmists are now probably scraping the bottom of their rotten climate science Apple barrel.The net zero agenda is so farcical it might be prudent to bring along a troop of clowns, comedians and cartoonists who are best able to explain and depict the logic of the government programs for net zero.I contributed to one of their meetings, they were talking about amalgamating into a single organisation, and I suggested not to. I said whoever is head of that organisation will make themselves a target, that a brush fire is the hardest kind of fire to fight, because there is no single place our opponents can focus to put it out.Naturally theyre getting the silent treatment from mainstream media, or when mentioned are dismissed as cranks and extremists, but their demands are actually quite moderate. For example, though some are totally against renewables, many of the participants are OK with powerlines being built, but they want them built underground, where they wont bother anyone.I contributed to one of their meetings, they were talking about amalgamating into a single organisation, and I suggested not to. I said whoever is head of that organisation will make themselves a target, that a brush fire is the hardest kind of fire to fight, because there is no single place our opponents can focus to put it out.BTW Nick, why do you h@te poor people so much as to want to feather your crony friends nests with grant money for settled science and money to the Chinese and European solar and wind bird chopper manufacturers.Nick Stokes shared a photo of the rally when it had barely begun. Well Im a part of that grass roots movement and trust me it has grown substantially over the past five years to well over a hundred different groups. What people forget is that Australia is a huge continent with a relatively small population so we are never going to be able to hold rallies like those in Europe. They are geographically small countries with large populations.There were attendees from parts of Queensland, Victoria and South Australia which means they travelled there by plane most likely. Those from within NSW would still have had many hours of driving to get to Canberra as well as one or two nights accommodation. My point is that to attend the rally was costly and took valuable time out of a farmers work schedule. We were impressed with the attendance of the people who put in so much valuable time, effort and personal expense to get the attention of the politicians on their first day back in parliament.Getup, which is along the same lines as the Antifa dress up crowd, tried to intimidate us with a flood of messages stating that they would effectively take over the rally with their presence and were asking their supporters for $12 donations towards signs that would outnumber ours at the rally. No one turned up! Then they had the gall to put out a message that theyd basically shut us down. All lies! We experienced none of the opposition we had expected.We had amazing support from politicians speaking up for us as well as farmers and others from the regions who spoke really well. Peter Ridd spoke too, a name that you would all be familiar with. The government now know that there is considerable opposition to their renewables plan. And as we are many groups united it will not be easy for them to shut us down.

Tech companies have largely focused on powering these through renewable and sustainable energy sources in an effort to boost their green credentials and address climate change. However, increased energy demand caused by the arrival of new technologies like AI is making the task tricky, as this field alone consumes about four times as much power as servers used for cloud applications.According to McKinsey, the power requirements of US data centers are projected to jump from 17 gigawatts (GW) in 2022 to 35 GW by 2030. Electricity isn't the only concern. GPUs used for AI have higher cooling needs than traditional servers, and Microsoft's water usage in data centers rose by 34% in 2022. This figure is expected to surge as the tech giant further increases its investments in AI.Stepping into this role is Erin Henderson, PhD, MBA, PMP, who brings a wealth of experience from her 13-year tenure at the Tennessee Valley Authority, where she served as the General Manager of Transmission Projects.Writing on LinkedIn about her new post, Henderson said "I am very excited to share that I've joined Microsoft in a new role, Director of Nuclear Development Acceleration. Microsoft is leading the way in advocating for a clean and sustainable energy future. I am looking forward to contributing to the datacenter R&D team's success."Wayne Williams is a freelancer writing news for TechRadar Pro.

legislation in early February that would eliminate renewable power objectives within France's energy code, including targets for reducing energy consumption by way of renovating buildings. France24 indicated that the legislation sets no explicit targets for building renewable capacity.Energy Transition Minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher told the weekly newspaper La Tribune Dimanche that the construction of these reactors is necessary to reduce the country's reliance on fossils fuels to 40% from 60% by 2035, admitted in 2021 that nuclear energy was the most reliable energy source, at least on this side of the Atlantic Ocean. Each nuclear reactor typically generates the same amount of power as 431 utility-scale wind turbines or 3.1 million solar panels.study published in the journal Nature Communications indicated, "If future net-zero emissions energy systems rely heavily on solar and wind resources, spatial and temporal mismatches between resource availability and electricity demand may challenge system reliability."The researchers indicated that "the most reliable renewable electricity systems are wind-heavy and satisfy countries' electricity demand in 72-91% of hours ... Yet even in systems which meet >90% of demand, hundreds of hours of unmet demand may occur annually."suggested in a blog post that the bill, which goes before the French cabinet next month, "weakens France's climate objectives, starting with the objective of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. The objective would no longer be to 'reduce' but to tend towards a reduction in 'our greenhouse gas emissions.'"indicated that an increase in French exports of nuclear power to other European nations would likely reduce their dependence on fossil fuels and thereby spare climate alarmists the guilt often associated with winter warmth.Already this year, France has reportedly overseen a three-year high in nuclear generation. From Jan. 2-9, France was an average daily net exporter of over 12.2 gigawatts of power, with roughly 3 gigawatts going to Germany and another six headed to Switzerland, the U.K., and Italy.
The proposed text affirms the sustainable choice of using nuclear energy as a competitive and carbon-free source of electricity, and targets the construction of at least six but as many as 14 new reactors to pull off the transition to clean energy and meet climate change goals.If you only quantify nuclear power, you do not know the share of non-renewable energies. As a result, nuclear gets prioritised and, depending on remaining coverage needs, non-renewables will be the subject of floating (future) decrees. Its no longer a mix, Gosse saidWhat is going through the minds of activists who object to nuclear energy? France already gets most of its electricity from nuclear reactors, it wouldnt take much more capacity for France to get 100% of its electricity from zero carbon nuclear.the author asks, What is going through the minds of activists who object to nuclear energy?One possible answer might be found by following the money. China probably doesnt restrict its political activism to only the US:A climate-focused nonprofitwith significant operations in Beijinghas wired millions of dollars to fund climate initiatives and environmental groups in the U.S., according to tax filings first obtained by Fox News Digital.While the Energy Foundations financial filings indicate that the group is technically headquartered in San Francisco, a Fox News Digital review determined that the majority of its operations are conducted in China with a staff that boasts extensive ties to theChinese Communist Party (CCP). Its recently filed tax form show the group, which refers to itself as Energy Foundation China, contributed $3.8 million to initiatives in the U.S. like phasing out coal and electrifying the transportation sector.The table highlights the nonsense of relying on wind and solar with multiple international interconnections on the premise that the wind always blows and the sun always shines somewhere. Its bitterly cold in Europe at present and they aint letting the U.K. have their juices. In addition, Vlad has certainly mapped exactly where these cables run.When the two major bastions of freedom  the USA and the UK  get decent politicians in power we will fight back as the French are doing, but at the moment we both have liabilities at leadership level and nobody prepared to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  Johnson was not the answer and only ever did half the job.  Trump had them worried, so worried, and we all know what happened as a result.Sadly, the judiciary have moved beyond the well tried and tested truth, whole truth and nothing but the truth. Now we have people being fined and even imprisoned for telling the truth! Those cases are increasing with the prosecution adopting the new legal high ground of, hate crime. The facts are less important now than the emotions of the so called victim?We have had a case in Switzerland of all places, where the defendant quoted directly from the Koran in their defence.  No matter, the court ruled the quoting of what is in the book followed by so many and leading to some awful outcomes was upsetting and risked promoting a public reaction.At the moment its surely looking like a popular vote which has a pretty high percentage for Reform  maybe as much as 15-20%.  Who knows, its rising every week.  But the result of this in the UK political system will probably be a wipeout for the Conservative Party, and a landslide for Labour, but minimal Commons presence for Reform.There are 650 MPs in the Commons.  Depending on how well Reform does, you can imagine the Conservatives falling to under 100, other parties perhaps 100, and Labour with 450 and a 250 seat majority. Could go higher, there have been projections of a Conservative rump of well under 100 MPs.You can imagine Conservatives reduced to 50, at an extreme.  Other remains at 100.  Then you have 500 Labour MPs (helped by the ongoing SNP implosion) and a Labour majority of 350.  Its pretty far out in probability, but its definitely possible.Its quite likely, that in all these scenarios Reform gets at best a couple of seats because their vote is spread across the country and not focused on particular constituencies.  Enough to push the Conservatives out, but not enough to win, so Labour gets in because the conservative vote is split.The chances of any change in UK Net Zero policies as a result of the likely November election seem to be negligible.  All the parties contesting, Conservative, Labour, SNP, Greens, Plaid, Liberals, all of them are committed to Net Zero.I think that given the choice between same old Labour, same old Tory, same old Limp Dumbs, and same old SNP Greens and Plaid Cymru, voting reform is a reasonable alternative to spoiling the ballot paper or simply not bothering to vote at all.The problem for Reform is that its vote is spread out over all constituencies, so the most likely outcome, even if they get into the high twenties, must surely be a Labour landslide.  My scenario with Conservatives reduced to a rump of 50 MPs.Thge 18% is hard to assess.  It doesnt necessarily translate into actual votes on election day, and there are still nine months to go so a lot can change.  But if it carries on, and momentum builds, it is starting to be conceivable that there could be a swing comparable to that in Holland for Wilders, or comparable to the rise of the AfD in Germany.  But Holland is proportional representation, so the outcome will be very different.I still think that in this scenario a Labour majority of 200+ is the most likely outcome.  I cant really see Reform getting to enough seats to be a force in Parliament.  But one interesting possibility is the effect on public feeling if they were to get (say) 30% of the vote and 5-10 seats.  I dont know how likely it is, but imagine a wild result something like this:I dont know how plausible or likely anything like this is, but if it happened surely the effects on public opinion would be extreme?  Im not sure the country would accept it.  Though what they would do about it?The British government has launched a roadmap for reaching its ambition for the UK to have 24 GWe of nuclear generating capacity by 2050, representing about 25% of the countrys projected electricity demand.The ultimate goal for them though is still an irrational one. Nuclear is fine for base load power, but you also need coal and gas as well to be able to respond to the daily and weather-related fluctuations in demand. The fantasy still seems to be that Ruinables can replace coal and gas, and that is just dream world craziness.NuScale, probably close to bankruptcy, has a SMR design that put safety in the form of automatic no power input required shutdown systems and variable output capability to provide for unreliable output of unreliables.The North Anna site was originally licensed for 2 more units never built. In 2017 it received a license to build a safer design for a third plant. I am sure way more expensive to build that the original Westinghouse design.NOW, both Virginia plants use open source fresh water for cooling, Surry using the James River and N. Anna using a Lake Anna built on the North Anna River to provide the cooling, so no cooling towers for added expenses.Nope, the ultimate goal is to launder taxpayers money through the green gristmill to the leftist politicians who run much of the western countries today, and the leftists NGO who help those politicians control the MSM and social media dialogue and, thus, help the selfsame politicians get elected.Notwithstanding recent maintenance issues with about half of Frances 59 nuclear fleet, they have been supplying about 80% of demand, the balance being hydro, geothermal, natural gas (from North Africa), and 2  3% wind/solar and a wave machine.That meant that much of the rural population  a large part of the French population  used wood stoves, oil, LPG for heating and wood stoves and bottled gas for cooking.  Electricity was mostly for lights, TV, refrigerator and small appliances.There was no rationale nor logic for France to subsidise and install wind and solar to replace its nuclear fleet  the target at the time was to replace a third of nuclear output with wind and solar  other than the nonsense that nuclear was not a renewable (which it is, as spent fuel rods are reprocessed) and not carbon neutral.After the European idiots cut themselves off from Russian gas and panic ensued, Emperor Macronavirus saw the light, and realised France with mostly nuclear electricity was self-dependent, not at risk of geopolitical shenanigans.It is true France uses a lot of motor fuels. It is a large Country  much less urbanised compared to the UK for example  with a large scattered rural population, making reliance for most on bus services or trains impossible.  Motor transportation is vital for distribution of food and goods, farming, small business and private use.Trying to electrify the road/vehicle system, given the geography and demography, is neigh impossible on practical and cost grounds. I cannot see the France responding well to the banning of ICE vehicles or any further attempts to carbon tax motor fuels, particularly diesel on which France mostly runs.Correction: piped gas was confined to cities and big towns but not any more. I can only answer directly for the southern part of Burgundy but I am assured that the areas not on the gas grid are now largely those dpartements where the exercise would be so costly as to make it counter-productive. Isolated farms and hamlets still rely on bottled gas as do similar dwellings in most European countries.As for EVs, youre right enough. There are certainly areas where they would not be a cost-effective option. At the same time France sees itself still as a largely rural country (which it is!) and every French citizen is entitled as far as possible to the same rights as every other French citizen. Which means that France will tailor its climate commitments to its own circumstances as far as that is practicable.Heating and Evaporating the Water:(145 million metric ton x {(22 C seawater heated to 100 C = 78 C delta T) x (4186 J/kg-C = 326508 J/kg ) + (40650 J/18 g mole x 1000 = 2258333 J/kg)} =0.3774 exajoulesThe strong El Nio of late 2023, coincided with increased lower-atmosphere temperatures of about 0.30 C, that were augmented by the after effects of theHunga Tongavolcaniceruption in January 2022. See Images 1 and 7Every once in a while we see a glimmer of hope when, apparently accidentally, a prominent leader chooses policy that is actually based on the universe we live in, and not on some drug induced dream of unicorn farts and pixie dust.If France builds at least six nuclear plants there obviously is no need for any more wind or solar. It is wind and solar that send us backward not nuclear. These renewable gangsters need to take a hike.At last there is a general realisation dawning that Net Zero and several other doom-laden climate fantasy forecasts that are, in reality, utter nonsense and a HUGE waste of money  promoted of course by those who want to beggar the economies of Western Countries..  We see this fight-back in the UK (at last) with the UK government reopening some North Sea Oil  reserves  so allowing us to combat the many excessive and past ill-considered so-called green initiatives.  We need scientific reality and not manipulated temperature records (as currently seen in the USA) driving our future.

Sam Altman is a major investor in Helion Energy an American-based fusion research company and together, they are trying to build the first nuclear fusion power plant. If they succeed in doing so, they will be the first to put this technology to practical use.In May 2023, Microsoft signed a power purchase agreement with Helion, confirming that theyll buy electricity from them in 2028. This gives the company almost 4 years to bring the project to life by which it aims to build a 50MW nuclear fusion power plant.As of now, OpenAI gets hundreds of millions of queries every single day which approximately takes up 1GWh of energy on a daily basis. This is equivalent to the amount of energy used by 33,000 households in the US.And this breakthrough seems very possible now that companies are relying on AI to grow their business. Their own needs are motivating them to heavily invest in renewable energy sources like nuclear fusion and solar energy.Sam Altman has already invested $375 million in Helion Energy and seems pretty confident of meeting their 2028 deadline. If this project successfully goes through, itll not only benefit Helion but also catapult OpenAIs growth and give it an edge over its competitors.Krishi is an eager Tech Journalist and content writer for both B2B and B2C, with a focus on making the process of purchasing software easier for businesses and enhancing their online presence and SEO.

The fund plans to invest in the expansion of clean energy, accelerate sustainable solutions and technologies, and help companies within carbon-intensive sectors transition to more sustainable business practices. Its seed portfolio reportedly includes an onshore renewables developer in the United Kingdom and a solar partnership in India.Brookfield also expresses plans to achieve a larger fundraiser than its previous transition fund. The Canadian companys first fund closed at $15 billion in June of 2022, becoming the largest fund of its kind in the world. Investments from that first financing round are currently going toward renewable power, business transformation, carbon capture and storage, renewable natural gas, and nuclear services.We have demonstrated beyond doubt the breadth and scale of attractive investment opportunities in the transition to a net zero economy, said Mark Carney, chair and head of transition investing for Brookfield. By going where the emissions are, the Brookfield Global Transition Fund strategy is aiming to deliver strong risk-adjusted financial returns for investors and make meaningful environmental impacts for people and the planet.In November 2023, Brookfield and Cameco jointly acquired global nuclear giant, Westinghouse, citing a lasting demand outlook for nuclear power. Westinghouse is the core service provider for over 50% of the worlds operating nuclear reactors. The company has also developed small modular reactors and other next-generation advanced reactors, which are expected to drive future nuclear energy development.Despite mixed opinions on nuclear powers role in the clean energy transition, the industry has been identified as a major contributor to meeting global electricity demand through clean energy sources.Nuclear is currently the second largest global source of clean energy after hydropower, and the International Energy Agency expects nuclear energy generation to reach an all-time global high by early 2025 to meet this rising demand. The U.K. also released plans earlier this year to increase nuclear generation by up to four times its current amounts, making the energy source a key piece of its overall decarbonization strategy.

The European Green Party wants to move up its timeline for attaining net-zero emissions from 2050 to 2040, but the German Greens are advocating for a 2045 target date and seeking to cut out calls to end the use of natural gas by 2035 and oil by 2040, according to Euractiv. The German Greens are part of the countrys governing coalition, which has seen its popularity plummet as the countrys economy has performed poorly amid a prolonged energy crisis.The 2045 target date is already a part of the German Greens platform, but the timelines for oil and gas phaseouts are points of contention between the German party and the wide European institution, according to Euractiv.(RELATED: Germany Says Nuclear Energy Is Dangerous, Slams EU For Labeling It Sustainable)Germany closed its last remaining nuclear plants in April 2023 to complement its massive green energy spending blitz, even as the German economy was deteriorating as soaring energy costs undermined its industrial base, according to Politico.The meager economic outlook and energy crisis is also shaking up German politics. German farmers recently conducted a week-long wave ofprotest across the country in response to the governments plan to cut crucial agricultural subsidies to plug a massive budget gap and fund green initiatives.The Alternative for Germany (AfD), the countrys right-wing populist party, has seen its popularity more than double since the Russian invasion of Ukraine started in February 2022, according to polling data from Politico. About 80% of the German population is unsatisfied with the current governing coalition, and more than half of the country wants elections before 2025, the currently scheduled date, accordingto Bloomberg News.So much wild stuff continues to be downstream of Germanys insane nuclear phaseout in the face of not only the energy crisis but also the EUs own climate goals. German Greens, part of a deeply unpopular coalition government, want a longer fossil phasedown to keep nuclear offline, Mark Nelson, the founder and managing director of Radiant Energy Group, an energy consultancy, wrote in a post to X. This is because if they lose power too soon, their now-unpopular enforcement of Germanys nuclear shutdown could be reversed as several reactors remain in pristine condition and a new German government without the Greens could quickly turn them back on.All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Think back to 1986 and 2011. If youre a seasoned uranium futures trader, you will know the significance of these years, although most people wont have a clue. If the current trend in uranium continues, 2024 could be another historic year for a commodity thats usually under the radar but is suddenly popping up in the headlines.To recap, the Chernobyl nuclear meltdown took place in Russia (the Soviet Union, at that time) in 1986, and the Fukushima nuclear disaster occurred in Japan in 2011. Those two terrible incidents gave nuclear energy a bad rap, as the saying goes.We can debate all day long whether this bad rap is deserved or not, but todays focus will be on investment opportunities. Is there value now in recently explosive uranium stocks? Thats the billion-dollar question, so lets start by taking stock of recent moves in the spot uranium price, which will naturally affect all uranium-market stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in 2024.To understand whats going on in the sphere of uranium and nuclear energy, youll have to look outside of North America. It wont be much of a pleasure trip, but when conducting your due diligence, you have to go wherever the action is.Our first stopover will be in France, which hasnt traditionally been amenable to nuclear-power proliferation. Indeed, France has been among the vanguard nations that promote solar, wind and other clean-energy sources.However, France may be on the cusp of redefining clean energy sources to include nuclear power. Tough times require a certain measure of flexibility, but Frances recent about-face concerning nuclear energy is practically unheard of.Believe it or not, a high-profile pro-nuclear bill is currently working its way through the French governments highest levels. The bill would provide for six to 14 new nuclear reactors and promotes the sustainable choice of usingnuclear energyas a competitive and carbon-free electricity source.Theres no guarantee that this bill will become the law of the land, but its a sign that governments in Europe and elsewhere may turn to nuclear power to shore up their energy independence. Yet, while global demand for uranium may soon be on the rise, its the supply side of the equation thats really sending the spot uranium price soaring.Now its time to visit Eastern Europes Kazakhstan, where NAC Kazatomprom, the largest producer of uranium on the planet, warned that it will be difficult to achieve its 2024 and 2025 goals for uranium production. The company didnt update its production guidance, but it did observe challenges in sourcing the necessary sulfuric acid to extract uranium.Thus, weve learned two things on our unusual two-stop jaunt. First, the global demand for uranium could increase if typically reluctant governments change their stances on nuclear power. Second, a key uranium producer probably wont meet its previously stated production targets.These factors were evidently enough to push the spot uranium price above $100 not long ago. The exact price is a constantly moving target, but uranium watchers lit up social media on Monday with breathy posts like this one:When it comes to buying commodity-related stocks and ETFs, whats more important than how is the question of how much. Im certainly not against the idea of buying uranium stocks and funds now, but any and all position sizes should be very small.Consequently, investors might consider starting off with a few shares of the Global X Uranium ETF (NYSEARCA:URA) and the Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:URNM) for general uranium-market exposure. To that, they can add a handful of shares of Canada-based Cameco (NYSE:CCJ) and U.S.-headquartered Uranium Energy Corp. (NYSEAMERICAN:UEC).Disclaimer: All investments involve risk.

In this article, we take a look at the 15 worst industrial disasters in the world. If you want to, you can skip our detailed robotics industry analysis and go directly to our shorter list of the 5 worst industrial disasters in the world.Industrial disasters are accidents that occur in industrial companies due to failure, negligence, or incompetence in handling chemical, mechanical, civil, electrical, or other processes. Since an industrial disaster involves dangerous chemicals and hazardous substances, it is a significant threat not just to humans, but also to the natural and infrastructural environment.Today, the industrial sector takes up a large portion of the world economy, making up 17.9% of the GDP of the United States, which is the largest economy in the world as of 2024. Over the decades, the industrial sector has maintained its position in the world economy. A detailed analysis of this conducted by the Industrial Analytics Platform further emphasizes the close link between industrial activities, economic growth, and sustainable development, and how industrial development will take a whole new level in the years to come.Given the importance of the industrial sector, it is also important to note that if the balance is tipped, there can be a significant impact on the world economy. Throughout history, weve seen multiple times how industrial disasters trigger huge economic losses and destabilize sustainable growth.Industrial disasters concern not just the manufacturing industries, but others as well. In 2022, the chemical industrys total revenue, on a global level, stood at around USD 5.72 trillion, reaching the highest value in the last 15 years. The chemical industry is growing at an exponential rate, but a minor negligence or failure involving chemicals like in the Bhopal Gas Tragedy can lead to a catastrophe.Similar to the chemical industry, the nuclear industry, which is responsible for generating 10% of the worlds electricity according to the World Nuclear Association, is also prone to disasters. For instance, in 2011, the Fukushima disaster in Japan was an eye-opener for many countries with nuclear energy plants. It dealt a heavy blow to Japan's economy, with its share of nuclear energy dropping from 29.2% in 2010-11 to 2.1% in 2012.Fortunately, the industrial sector continues to learn from past disasters and implement more safety precautions to safeguard the future. As world technology progresses, industrial workplace safety is enhanced and the risk of disasters is also minimized. One of the most effective solutions has been the incorporation of robotics technology as it can perform repetitive tasks faster and with much higher accuracy and precision than human workers.For the same reason, using robots and automating industrial manufacturing has been a growing trend in recent years. In 2023, there were around 4.09 million units of service robotics and 450 thousand units of industrial robots worldwide. (See: 15 Biggest Robotics Companies in the World). While human workers are still needed in industrial manufacturing, robots and machines can be used to handle hazardous chemicals and dangerous tasks to minimize industrial disasters.Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, economic growth has mainly come at the expense of the environment. While economies, populations, and resource demands grow continuously, the availability of resources remains the same, therefore urging industrial companies to adopt strategies in the modern world to uplift economies without exhausting natural resources.From human-centered processes to machine-reliant assembly lines to highly automated factories, industrial companies are adapting to new trends and transforming their methods. Some of the main reasons for adapting to new trends are to minimize the risk of disasters, improve efficiency, lower costs, and reduce material wastage.Some industrial companies are already incorporating Industry 4.0 in their manufacturing processes. For instance, HIROTEC Corporation, a major automotive supplier, uses the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) for operational intelligence and predicting maintenance in its manufacturing machines and assets.Some of the key players in the manufacturing companies are Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE: TM), Samsung Electronics (KSE: 005930), and BASF SE (ETR: BAS). All these industrial companies are well-aligned with Industry 4.0 and use it in their process management. In fact, in 2017, Apple partnered with GE to bring iOS into Industry 4. In 2023, Apple took more initiatives including the first Smart Manufacturing Forum for SMBs in South Korea, to showcase its serious involvement in the fourth industrial revolution.Over the years, Apple has invested millions of dollars in automation technology, and it is not the only one. Today, all industrial companies are prioritizing technology and development to reduce the risk of disasters and become the key players in their sector. At the same time, they acknowledge that automation technology cannot replace the skill of human workers even Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) did, in their conversation with The Information.For our list of the worst industrial disasters in the world, we analyzed a list of notable industrial disasters in the world and shortlisted the ones that incurred the most damage to human life and/or the economy. We ranked disasters based on the number of deaths caused by the disaster, going from the least to the highest. Weve also discussed financial and industrial losses caused by each disaster.By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.The Buncefield Explosion of 2005 is the only industrial disaster on this list where there were 0 fatalities. Still, many people were injured. This disaster took place in Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire, near the M1 motorway.The aftermath included a hefty cleanup, destroyed properties, and around 1 billion in damage. Total UK, Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd, and the British Pipeline Agency (BPA) were all fined after this disaster.On 10 July 1976, a chemical reactor exploded in the ICMESA plant located near Seveso, Italy. The disaster killed 3,000 farm animals immediately and left people with terrible health disorders. The explosion caused dioxins to leak into the area.While no human lives were lost as a result of the explosion, over 70,000 animals were euthanized to make sure no one would get harmed by the chemicals. To this day, the Seveso area is off-limits for any development.In the aftermath of this disaster, Seveso experienced financial consequences due to environmental damage, decreased property value, livestock loss, and agricultural loss. Healthcare costs also increased because of skin diseases caused by chemicals.The Deepwater Horizon Explosion of 2010 is known as one of the most significant oil spills and one of the worst industrial disasters in history. As a result of this disaster, 11 people lost their lives and 17 got severely injured.The Deepwater Horizon rig is owned by BP PLC (NYSE: BP), a leading oil company. According to a report published by BP, the explosion was a result of many causes all of which contributed to a wellhead explosion, the release of natural gas, and its eventual ignition at the rig. After the explosion, 1000 barrels of oil leaked into the ocean daily for 85.5 days.BP had to pay compensation of $20 million to the victims and families of those who lost their loved ones. A lot of damage was caused by this explosion, including thousands of marine animals dying. This explosion also left many people unemployed due to the lack of tourism in the petroleum-laden areas.Another tragic chemical explosion, the Texas city refinery disaster, was the result of a vapor cloud of chemicals catching on fire. One hundred eighty workers were heavily injured, and 15 lost their lives. This took place at a BP refinery in Texas when a vapor cloud exploded in its isomerization process unit.BP PLC (NYSE: BP) was sued for an environmental crime and charged a $50 million fine. BP PLC (NYSE: BP) also had to pay around $1.6 billion to compensate the victims. These continued until 2009 when OSHA charged BP a whopping $87 million fine.The deadly Phillips Disaster took place in 1989 when high-flammable gasses caused multiple explosions at the Phillips Petroleum Company (NYSE: PSX). Twenty-three people were killed and 314 were injured. The fire lasted for 10 hours, damaging water pipes and making it harder to put out.The Chernobyl disaster of 1986 is one of the most known industrial disasters and even inspired a $40 million show by HBO. The miniseries depicted the atrocities of the disaster and helped create awareness regarding industrial disasters. It is available to watch on Apple TV+(NASDAQ: AAPL) as well. The disaster took 50 lives and has left the entire area radioactive and inhabitable to this day. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone will be habitable again in 20,000 years.In April 1986, an explosion occurred at a Chernobyl nuclear plant. Perhaps the worst nuclear disaster to ever exist, over $68 billion was spent to help with migration. Chernobyl is still radioactive, although some residents have returned to their homes.There was a direct loss of $12.6 billion on the economic side. Around 784,320 hectares of land were destroyed, and food production in the area was banned. The disaster also caused significant electrical loss in places like Ukraine.The Xiangshui chemical plant produced chemicals such as pesticides and other organic compounds and has since shut down. Like the other disasters mentioned on this list, the plant ignored waste management and safety regulations warnings. Not only did they choose to ignore them, but there had also been previous fires at this plant.In March 2019, an explosion took place, killing 78 people and destroying buildings nearby. The Xiangshui chemical plant was shut down soon after, and the district faces a property loss of around $100 million. There was also an economic loss of about $284.3 million.The Centralia Mine Disaster is known as the second-worst mining disaster in the US, killing over 100 people. It took place in Centralia, Pennsylvania on 25 March 1947. The disaster started off with the electricity being cut off and thick black smoke surging through the mines. This then led to a large accumulation of smoke and a deadly explosion.Poor safety regulations and coal dust caused this tragic explosion. Out of 142 men, only 31 managed to escape. The mine had received previous warnings about the coal dust that was collecting, but they chose to ignore it.Some economic consequences faced after this disaster were compensation for victims, recovery investments, and safety regulations. According to a report by the UN, there was a temporary decline in coal production after the disaster.The Beirut explosion is one of the most recent industrial disasters caused by an ammonium nitrate explosion in the capital of Lebanon. There were more than 200 deaths and 7000 injuries resulting from the incident which took place in 2020. This explosion was the cause of large amounts of ammonium nitrate that had been stored in a warehouse without proper security measures. Lebanese authorities believe that welding work was what resulted in a fire which then led to the explosion.While some time has passed, Beirut still hasn't recovered from the explosion. Not only did this disaster weaken the local currency and push millions into poverty, but it also wrecked necessary infrastructure like ports. The economic loss caused by this incident was around $15 billion, with $3 billion going into infrastructure restoration. With the port destroyed, there was a lack of exports and imports, which the country relied on.In December 2003, PetroChinas Chuandongbei natural gas field exploded in the municipality of Chongqing, China, killing more than 233 people and injuring over 10,000, putting it sixth on our list of the worst industrial disasters in the world. The blast was at such a catastrophic level that it nearly wiped out an entire village and caused other widespread damages.While there isnt much information about how much PetroChina (HKSE: 0857) paid compensation regarding this case, there most likely would have been rescuing operation costs, property damages, and compensation for blast victims.
"Consumers who heat with electricity and live in E.ON's basic supply area have so far been able to benefit from relatively low prices for the basic heating electricity supply despite the energy crisis. But that will soon be over," said the North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) consumer advice center. The notice period is two weeks after the firm has been provided with existing customers in the Alternative Tariff Offer. NRW also gave important tips for those who wanted to leave. "Since the choice of heating electricity [rates] is smaller than with household electricity, we recommend that you first allow a longer contract term of up to 24 months in the filter settings. However, a shorter maturity of only twelve months is recommended," Mueller explained as per the English-translated site. "To find a suitable heating electricity [rate], consumers need to know how the heating current is measured in them, which means which electricity meters are installed." She also said that it would make sense to ask local providers about rate options because not all rates options would be found on the comparison portals. The rate at which electrical energy is supplied to a consumer is known as a tariff. Although tariffs should include the total cost of producing and supplying electrical energy plus the profit, they cannot be the same for all types of consumers. Meanwhile, reports claimed that Germany's gas supply situation has become better than it was after Russia cut off supply last winter. E.ON's boss insisted that the instability in the Middle East is the reason why energy prices are soaring. "It would take a lot for there to be gas shortages this winter," CEO Leonhard Birnbaum told the Rheinische Post newspaper, noting stores were full and China, the largest buyer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), was now buying less. And because much of the LNG which Germany now relies upon comes from the Gulf, instability there would have an impact, he noted. "If there is an escalation, that would have an impact on all energy markets," he said. "They are more interwoven than before: not only the oil price but also gas and electricity prices. The Persian Gulf is the central route for oil and LNG." Birnbaum added that there was no prospect of Germany's decommissioned nuclear plants ever being reactivated, something opposition politicians have called for since Isar 2, Germany's last plant, was switched off in April. "Isar 2 won't go back online," he said. "It's already being dismantled. It's no longer even technically possible."

The move is claimed to be part of the expansion of public and private charging infrastructure for electric vehicles across Germany and Europe. At the new site in Essen, E.ON is testing and researching charging solutions on an area of around 10,000 square meters. The test lab has 25 stations and digital test environments are available for testing vehicles, charging stations, wallboxes and accessories. It also has five special climate chambers that allow E.ON engineers to simulate all temperature conditions that occur around the world, from freezing cold to extreme heat. "Energy transition, clean transport, climate protection, all this will only succeed if electromobility gains even more momentum. We will build at least 1,000 additional public charging stations across Europe every year, further accelerating the transformation of traffic and transport. With our new test and innovation center, we are creating the necessary capacity to meet the growing demand for charging infrastructure. As a result, we are ideally positioned for the dynamic market development of electric mobility," E.ON Board Member Patrick Lammers said. According to Petrol Plaza, E.ON's test lab is the only facility in Europe where fast charging in heavy-duty vehicles can be tested with up to three megawatts of power. The company plans to build at least 1,000 new ultra-fast charging stations per year in its European markets. In Germany, E.ON will build around 140 new charging locations with more than 1,200 charging points for the federally subsidized German network, making it one of the largest operators of the nationwide fast-charging network. This is in addition to the charging infrastructure E.ON is building for its customers across Europe.

The move is claimed to be part of the expansion of public and private charging infrastructure for electric vehicles across Germany and Europe. At the new site in Essen, E.ON is testing and researching charging solutions on an area of around 10,000 square meters.

The draft manifesto, dated 12 January and currently under negotiations with party members, is likely to be approved at the EPPs political assembly on 29-30 January before the electoral congress in Bucharest in early March. [Shutterstock/Alexandros Michailidis]A draft electoral manifesto of the EU centre-right European Peoples Party (EPP) seen by Euractiv suggests cutting down on EU bureaucracy in key policy areas such as tech, stating we want to enable, develop, and utilise AI, not contain it or hinder it. It also echoes mounting complaints from across the bloc about overregulation in environmental, agricultural and social policy.While the 2024 EU election agenda of the largest political party in the European Parliament, also the political home to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, remains focused on law and order, it also calls for a fight against Brussels red tape.The draft manifesto, dated 12 January and currently under negotiations with party members, will likely be approved at the EPPs political assembly on 29-30 January before the electoral congress in Bucharest in early March.Legislation needs to be user-friendly and easy to understand, and it must be implemented. We will reduce old bureaucracy by introducing a 1 in, 2 out; principle with an overall objective of reducing the regulatory burden by a third, through a specific action plan, the draft reads.On technology, the EPP vouches for artificial intelligence but not artificial bureaucracy, adding that we want to enable, develop, and utilise AI, not contain it or hinder it through over-regulation.On agriculture, they vouch to eliminate excessive requirements for farmers, attributing the bureaucratic burden to increased green legislation: This applies in particular to issues such as new rules on the sustainable use of plant protection products (SUR), the document reads.The 2019 manifesto also strongly focused on combating climate change, but, unlike the 2024 version reviewed by Euractiv, it gave prominence to the need to balance economic development with the environment, urging to significantly reduce the environmental impacts of our economy.The lack of mentions of environmental protection is consistent with recent declarations from German MEP Peter Liese, the EPPs spokesperson in the Parliaments environment committee, who said the top political priority at the moment was to fight climate change and ensure industries in Europe have access to affordable clean energy.Following EPPs impetus to become the farmers party, the manifesto strongly prioritises boosting the sector to secure food production and farmers jobs over climate protection and biodiversity, in a clear hint againstthe nature restoration law.The most concrete proposal on fisheries is the call for a better focus on this sector through a stand-alone portfolio on fisheries in the next European Commission. Currently, the portfolio is environment, oceans, and fisheries, held by Commissioner Virginijus Sinkeviius.On energy and climate, the EPP put together a catch-all programme that tries to please everyone. Yet, what transpires is an attempt to rebalance the priorities of the Green Deal to focus on Europes economic competitiveness and re-industrialisation: Without climate protection, our economy cannot remain competitive in the long term, but without a competitive economy, there can be no sustainable climate protection either.The EPP advocates a technology-neutral approach to climate policy, saying it will support all renewable energies equally  meaning not just solar and wind but also geothermal, hydropower, and liquid and solid biomass (e.g. wood).As for nuclear energy, the EPP says it supports it where and when it makes sense. Whats clear is that the EPP will oppose bans on any kind of technology, including polluting ones: We reject a ban policy  such as the ban on combustion engines  and will also revise it as soon as possible.To strengthen the EUs external borders, EPP proposes to triple the amount of Frontex staff to 30,000. In 2019, the party proposed to expand the EUs border agency to 10,000 employees, though it is currently at around 2,000.On security, the draft proposes to increase Europols workforce from 650 to 3.000 to fight against organised crime and terrorism, as well as violence against women, a new addition from 2019s manifesto.The draft also contains a call for a European convention to improve EU treaties but, rather than to boost the integration of competencies, to review which ones should be possibly transferred back [to member states].

The National Rally Against Reckless Renewables is on the first sitting day of Parliament, Tuesday, 6th February 2024, at 10am in front of Parliament House. This peaceful rally is grassroots, representing many diverse regional communities who are directly and adversely affected by the Australian Governments reckless rollout of renewables. We urge the Federal and State Governments to cease their reckless rollout of unreliable, unaffordable, and environmentally destructive wind, solar, limited firming batteries, and high-voltage transmission lines, amidst an ever-increasing demand for reliable electricity.Currently, there are over 1000 new renewable projects in the governments Powering Our Nation pipeline (Source AEMO, 2023). Almost all of these are located in Regional Australia. In the lead-up to most of these projects, this government has conducted short, insincere, and unacknowledged community consultation. Exploiting the fact that most of these projects are located in or near coastal, farming, and traditional communities with small populations, the government continues to disregard our concerns. In many cases, our right to judicial review or appeal has or will be removed.Australian consumers, taxpayers, and industries require an electricity network that is efficient, safe, reliable, secure, and affordable. It is critical for Australia, now and in the future, to establish a network that does not damage our unique environment, particularly productive agricultural land, fisheries, and native habitats.This governments reckless rollout of renewables poses a significant threat to our nation, threatening food production for Australians and 80 million consumers globally. Our fauna and flora are facing unprecedented destruction, as hundreds of thousands of hectares of land and ocean floors are being deforested and/or damaged. It is posing a threat to our economy, costing over $121 billion (AEMO, 2023). There are documented serious supply chain and sustainment issues, and therefore reliability risks, potentially leading to mass blackouts. Massive taxpayer subsidies and electricity bills will flow offshore for decades to the many greenwashed multinationals lined up for these subsidised investments.This rally is a coalition of grassroots community groups united under the National Rational Energy Network. We call upon the Australian Government to:1. Conduct an urgent Senate Inquiry: Establish a Senate Inquiry to scrutinise the technical veracity as well as the excessive economic, social and environmental costs of renewables, and the escalating risks to our national interest and security. This includes reviewing the committed, anticipated, actionable and future projects being fast-tracked by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment, and Water, in particular the Capacity Investment Scheme, Rewiring the Nation, Offshore Wind Projects, and expanding unelected overreaching organisations including the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, Climate Change Authority, Clean Energy Finance Corporation, Australian Energy Market Operator, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, and Clean Energy Council.2. Suspend all renewable energy projects: We call on the Australian Government to convene the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) Energy Council and request all states and territories suspend wind, solar, hydro and associated transmission construction until the above Senate Inquiry reports.3. Lift the ban on nuclear power: Nuclear energy has the lowest overall greenhouse gas emissions of any energy source as a result of its low land footprint, low material usage, and low waste output. The current ban is archaic, restraining Australia from achieving a strong reliable energy future.This is a national grassroots call for a responsible and sustainable approach to our energy future. We urge the Australian government to prioritise the well- being of our environment, communities, and the future of our nation.[10.00am Mr Grant Piper] [10.10am Ms Gemma Pride] [10.20am Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price] [10.30am Mr Craig Kelly] [10.40am Senator Ralph Babet] [10.50am Senator Ross Cadell] [11.00am Hon Barnaby Joyce MP] [11.10am The Hon Dr David Gillespie MP] [11.20 Senator the Hon.

Aboriginals speaking about desecration of sacred land during the building wind turbines are about as welcome in Aussie mainstream media as black power people supporting Trump are in the US mainstream media.Jacinta Price is one of Australias star politicians. She and her mother Bess Price (and families) are from Alice Springs and deserve high-praise for standing resolutely on principles that have nothing to do with race.No Bill, Jacinta is an evil Alt White and does not correctly represent the traditional owners who have had 100,000 years of perfect harmony on this continent which clearly involved sustainable farming in large permanent towns and had nothing to do with killing off all the megafauna and/or burning down so much of the forests that the rainfall patterns changed. Clearly.Did we get the Completely Unrelated Third Party Who No One Has Heard Of Before Or Invited that can march up in neo 1930s Euro cosplay and decisively prove to the MSM that the entire rally was funded by. (gasp) the Alt Right!! ?5- 30 meters deep) sea sponge. (A meaning from a limited sampled area a small part part of, NOT the whole Caribbean. My beach collected sponge spicules are all shallow origin.) Down where we already know thermocline temperatures are affected by ocean currents. And where we also know sea sponge spicule chemistry is at best a sketchy proxy for temperature alonewhich is why previously sea sponges almost never were used before as a temp proxy. Not even by Mann, Marcott, or Pages2.Novel but sketchy narrow geographic proxy extrapolated to usual alarmist global result. Very climate sciency. Alarmists are now probably scraping the bottom of their rotten climate science Apple barrel.The net zero agenda is so farcical it might be prudent to bring along a troop of clowns, comedians and cartoonists who are best able to explain and depict the logic of the government programs for net zero.I contributed to one of their meetings, they were talking about amalgamating into a single organisation, and I suggested not to. I said whoever is head of that organisation will make themselves a target, that a brush fire is the hardest kind of fire to fight, because there is no single place our opponents can focus to put it out.Naturally theyre getting the silent treatment from mainstream media, or when mentioned are dismissed as cranks and extremists, but their demands are actually quite moderate. For example, though some are totally against renewables, many of the participants are OK with powerlines being built, but they want them built underground, where they wont bother anyone.I contributed to one of their meetings, they were talking about amalgamating into a single organisation, and I suggested not to.

Well Im a part of that grass roots movement and trust me it has grown substantially over the past five years to well over a hundred different groups. What people forget is that Australia is a huge continent with a relatively small population so we are never going to be able to hold rallies like those in Europe. They are geographically small countries with large populations.There were attendees from parts of Queensland, Victoria and South Australia which means they travelled there by plane most likely. Those from within NSW would still have had many hours of driving to get to Canberra as well as one or two nights accommodation. My point is that to attend the rally was costly and took valuable time out of a farmers work schedule. We were impressed with the attendance of the people who put in so much valuable time, effort and personal expense to get the attention of the politicians on their first day back in parliament.Getup, which is along the same lines as the Antifa dress up crowd, tried to intimidate us with a flood of messages stating that they would effectively take over the rally with their presence and were asking their supporters for $12 donations towards signs that would outnumber ours at the rally. No one turned up! Then they had the gall to put out a message that theyd basically shut us down. All lies! We experienced none of the opposition we had expected.We had amazing support from politicians speaking up for us as well as farmers and others from the regions who spoke really well. Peter Ridd spoke too, a name that you would all be familiar with. The government now know that there is considerable opposition to their renewables plan. And as we are many groups united it will not be easy for them to shut us down.
