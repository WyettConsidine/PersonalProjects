Every November, the Global Carbon Project publishes the year�s global CO2 emissions. It�s never good news. At a time when the world needs to be reducing emissions, the numbers continue to climb. However, while emissions have been moving in the wrong direction, many of the underpinning economic forces that drive them have been going the right way. This could well be the year when these various forces push hard enough to finally tip the balance.In 2022, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said it expected global energy emissions to hit their peak by 2025. This estimate marked a big change from the year before, sparked by accelerated investments in low-carbon technologies following the war in Ukraine. Rystad Energy�another research and analysis group�also expects a peak by 2025. Ember Climate�the leading source on global electricity data�estimates that emissions from global electricity already peaked in 2022. Analysts might disagree on the exact date, but it�s clear that a peak in emissions is now well within our grasp.The world is already steadily decarbonizing its electricity. Solar and wind are growing quickly, and in 2024 these two sources of renewable energy could outstrip the increase in electricity demand. If this happens, coal- and gas-burning will go down, and so will emissions.Unsurprisingly, when we actually reach peak emissions will depend a lot on the world�s largest emitter, China. In 2023 its emissions were still rising. This is partly due to its continued recovery from Covid-19. An ongoing drought also means its hydropower output has dropped. These factors highlight, again, how difficult these things are to predict: One unexpected event can always flip a peak into another record-breaking year.China�s peak, however, is going to come soon, because of record-high deployments of solar and wind, and an increase in nuclear power. Soon, the country will be adding enough sustainable energy to cover its growing electricity demand. China�s solar and wind output is already enough to cover the total electricity use of some of the world�s largest economies like Canada, Brazil, Russia, Japan, and even the world�s most populous country, India. In 2023 alone it could add enough to cover the UK�s entire electricity use.Another reason why the peak in global emissions might arrive in 2024 is the electric car revolution. Global sales of petrol and diesel cars peaked half a decade ago, and the IEA estimated that almost one in five cars sold globally in 2023 were electric. Previously, the agency hadn�t expected this milestone to be reached until 2030. (In 2020, this figure was just 4 percent.) This move to EVs will start to eat into global oil demand, until its peak arrives too. According to a report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, this could be as early as 2027.Of course, peaking emissions is just the start. The world needs to then reduce emissions, and quickly. But the downslope will be easier than the turning point, as the energy transition will no longer be in its infancy. 2024 will hopefully mark the beginning of a mature low-carbon global economy.
Betavolt Technology from Beijing claims to have pioneered the "miniaturization of atomic energy batteries."

These little batteries can join forces in series to crank out more power, per the company. Betavolt envisions smartphones that stay charged forever with a nuclear battery, potentially rendering your favorite USB-C chargers useless in the future.These batteries use radioactive decay to generate electricity, similar to the technology in pacemakers and spacecraft. However, people haven't really used this technology before because the radioactive element, like Plutonium, was too risky.To address safety concerns, Betavolt is building a version of this battery with a diamond semiconductor layer and a decaying nickel isotope. The company swears that there's zero radiation leaking out and no toxic chemicals in the mix�apparently,� nickel-63 turns into copper.Betavolt adds that its battery won't go all fiery or explode if you give it a shove, thanks to its layered setup. Plus, it's a tough cookie, operating in extreme temperatures ranging from a freezing -60 degrees Celsius to a scorching 120 degrees Celsius.By 2025, the firm wants to create tiny batteries capable of producing one watt.

We think of the power we generate as coming from all these different kinds of sources. Oil, gas, coal, nuclear, wind so varied! And yet they all fundamentally come down to moving a gas through a turbine to actually spin up a generator and make some juice. Even some solar plants worked this way, using the suns energy to heat water into steam to spin some blades and keep the lights on.A solar updraft tower works along these basic principles, too, but in a rather unique configuration. Its not since the dawn of the Industrial Age that humanity went around building lots of big chimneys, and if this technology makes good sense, we could be due again. Lets find out how it works and if its worth all the bluster, or if its just a bunch of hot air.The concept of a solar updraft tower is relatively simple to understand. The idea is to create a large greenhouse-type structure surrounding a tall vertical chimney. As solar energy passes through the glass of the greenhouse, it heats the air inside as well as the floor and other contents. Since the greenhouse is, by and large, not completely open to the atmosphere, the heat cannot readily pass away by convection, and so the air within tends to become hotter than ambient temperature.That is, except for the chimney. As the air under the greenhouse grows warmer, it becomes less dense, and thus due to buoyancy forces, it wishes to travel upwards, and the only way out is via the chimney. Its thus possible to install turbines in the base of the chimney to capture energy from this air as it travels up and out of the tower.Beyond simple power generation, the solar updraft tower also offers some potential for energy storage, much like a hydroelectric dam. The sun can be used to heat the air under the greenhouse, but that air does not have to be immediately allowed to pass through the chimney. It can be stored for some time before passing it through the turbines and up the stack. Some concepts propose to further improve the storage capability by adding large water tanks as thermal sinks beneath the greenhouse. However, like all thermal storage, its time-limited, as the air in the greenhouse starts losing energy when the sun goes down and the ambient temperature drops.Simple engineering tells us that the potential power output primarily relies on how much warm air you have to turn the turbine, and how much you can get it moving. Thus, a larger greenhouse collector area will have more power potential. So too will a taller chimney, which will create a greater pressure difference between the hot air at ground level and the cooler ambient air at the top. As you might imagine, theres not a huge amount of energy packed in to air thats just been warmed up a bit by the sun. Thus, to get significant output, youd want a huge collector and a huge chimney. If youre wondering about scale, youd want to consider chimneys many hundreds of meters high, and greenhouses measured in square kilometers.As a guide, one proposed project in Western Australia promised to generate 200 MW of power. The tradeoff? It involved a 1-km high tower and a collector 10 km in diameter, to be built at a cost of $1.67 billion. The engineering team behind the idea, Schlaich Bergermann and Partner, noted that solar updraft towers really only make sense at these massive scales. Smaller installations arent cost competitive with photovoltaic solar panels, but larger ones can be. Large facilities make enough power to offset the huge construction costs, and ongoing maintenance is cheap, as it really just involves keeping the turbines and generator up and running. There are no dirty panels to clean, for example.By and large, solar updraft towers have remained largely conceptual, with few real-world projects built. The best example of an actual solar updraft tower was a small-scale effort built in Manzanares, a locale south of Madrid, Spain in 1982. It was built for an output of 50 kW, and intended to operate for just 3 years. It ran for 7 years in the end, before collapsing in 1989 due to storm winds and corroded guy wires holding up the 194-meter tower. The chimney was paired with a 244-meter diameter collector, using a combination of glass and plastic membranes to create the greenhouse.More recently, other pilot projects have experimented with the technology. Researcheres in Botswana experimented with a small-scale build of just 22 meters height with a small 15-meter diameter collector. The country has instead looked to photovoltaic and concentrated solar power concepts since.Chinese efforts got a little further, but not by much. In Jinshawan, a $200 million project saw the construction of a solar tower on desert lands back in 2010. It combined solar updraft generation with a special air entry door that let it capture power from prevailing winds as well. Big plans were to see the build expand in multiple phases to eventually generate 27.5 megawatts, but it never came close. It achieved just 200 kilowatts, and was plagued by glass panels shattering in the greenhouse collector. It was originally supposed to have a 200-meter high chimney, but a nearby airport meant that it could only be built to 50 meters instead. This greatly limited the pressure differential available to help generate power from the heated air. The project continued for several years, but has made little impression.Solar updraft towers are an interesting concept, to be sure. They rely on simple physics and are easy to understand. However, to generate meaningful power, they require huge tracts of land and incredibly tall towers. They pose a great number of challenges, many of which are simply construction and land use related, and come with a great many unknowns.In comparison, weve now learned how to stick solar panels on every flat surface going spare, and are able to generate huge amounts of power via that route. Heck, theyre even sticking them on water now. Few governments or businesses would want to accept a pie-in-the-sky power generation project involving construction on a massive scale when there are easier routes to go. It seems that technology has marched well past the point where solar updraft chimneys might be viable, but who knows! Maybe one day, someone with a great deal of money and a taste for megaprojects might just make one a reality once more.> Large facilities make enough power to offset the huge construction costs, and ongoing maintenance is cheap, as it really just involves keeping the turbines and generator up and running. There are no dirty panels to clean, for example.A little bit of dirt on a solar panel has an outsized effect on its output in comparison to this. So yeah you have square kilometres to keep vaguely clean for good performance here vs very very clean in comparison for Photovoltaic (or you basically never clean either and PV efficency just drops off worse).I really dont see this as a great saving on that front though, the saving maintenance wise comes from how very very much cheaper to make and replace the bit of glass is compared to a solar panel in the array, so if anything like freakish football sized hail ever breaks some its easy to repair the whole structure cheaply and recycle the broken bits too.Very much not convinced this system makes sense in its own right  it is just so much land to commit to a relatively low power generator. But as a combination project with agriculture perhaps it really could  the whole thing is still a greenhouse and while balancing electric power generation vs optimal plant growth conditions potentially does put the two factors at odds Id think be possible to get good results for both. Though how the humidity that is certain around growing plants will change the function of the solar updraft is a little tricky too  the mass of the air will change as the water condenses, the water itself could pose a problem for the turbines etc.Too many variables to say that categorically  the concept will work to some extent anywhere in the world, so if its cold enough outside normally then its probably just a greenhouse no matter how much sun it catches. You can also regulate the temperatures to those required for the plants relatively easily, potentially even passively so it ends up staying warmer and productive overnight (plus wide range of plants some like it insanely hot).You could grow plants in the edge areas, where fresh air is already coming in at ambient temperature. You could bring air through underground pipes to inner sections to regulate the temperature for plants further in toward the chimney. The same effect is used in reverse to grow tropical plants in Nebraska greenhouses.Because solar panels loose efficiency as they warm up. Putting a ring of PV around the outside and using the draft to cool them makes sense, but the middle of the area would probably be barren or unused.Normal hail shouldnt be a problem, or at least only one if you dont build it to last 5 mins. Real freak weather is always possible, but that sort of freak weather can trash anything. At least this would be reasonably cheap to fix.Agriculture could happen under a double pane, though obviously to maximize power output opaque bottom surfaces, e.g. vanta black, for the energy collector would probably be optimal. Leading to a lot of barren land.For someone to write such an obvious lie as that quoted paragraph, its clear they either do not think about what they say or else they want to deceive to minimize huge flaws in the design. Yes of course it would cause massive ecological harm; anybody arguing otherwise is either fooling themselves or acting in bad faith.But that paragraph you object to is talking about something that on ecological harm terms should work out really negligible compared to most human activity. For instance consider the resources consumed for us to have this discussion, high complexity chemical refinery, mining, silicon fabrication etc just to make the computers and networking gear before you even get to consuming electricity in the process of achieving very littleArguably we are ecological vandals just for being here to read the article. So yes it covers a large land area, and wont be dirt cheap to build initially. However as it should then last and keep generating practically forever on a human timescale with only very basic input resources for the maintenance  making it as far as ecological harm goes pretty good for a human activity, and a bit like Hydro-electric or water reservoir dam it is a short duration major upset for a very local area that long term works out better for us and the local environment as the alternatives we would use are worse. Not sold the idea will really work out as a great choice  to me seems like there are other avenues that either reduce the demand or cohabitate with our cities etc , but theoretically it is sound enough to be a valid possible solution.Dam dont really tend to destroy any ecosystem and can actually increase the amount of rarer ecosytem behind them long term  It is rather more moving an ecosystem. Drowning one river/lake adjacent area to usually just create a much larger amount of those ecosystems around the now much larger perimeter  short term pain but for a long term payout.By human standards absolutely  we cover way more than that to get nothing but a flat surface to park our seats 4-12 but almost never transports more than 1 people vehicles. We flatten huge swathes of forest/jungle with no concern that the soil erosion now possible with the trees gone over such huge areas will damn nearly sterilise that land in short order so even more slashnburn it is, we dig giant open pits orders of magnitude bigger just to burn the really low grade coal contentsThink again. The worlds largest open pit coal mines are only about 4-5 kilometers across, or less than a quarter of the surface area of one of these monsters. And theyre worth much more than 200 MW so you dont need nearly as many.Even the Three Gorges Dam is only 2.3 kilometers wide and floods 632 square kilometers of land, and it also makes 18 Gigawatts of power. It gets the 200 MW out of just 7 square kilometers of land versus 79 square kilometers for the solar chimney.yes and just how deep? And where does all the waste go  Orders of magnitude bigger they are even if the land footprint of the pit itself isnt as large. And then just how far does the toxic byproduct crap and runnoff into the water ways end up spreading? Or the acid clouds created by the burning of such poor grade coal it is almost more nasty shit than actual coal in itA giant glass house and chimney to create an airflow by its very nature has to has lots of fresh air intakes so cant really be kept free from wildlife even if you wanted too Its going to be a different ecology in there no doubt about it, certainly not destruction free, but not the multiple decades of work after the fact to try and make the giant pit vaguely habitable for some form of life once its run dry And nowhere near the the same wider effect.You wont get me arguing against Hydro power. But it doesnt have a major flaw in requiring suitable geography in the first place. So if you can turn a field into a productive greenhouse and get electricity out of it for decades to come so cheaply, actually hard to argue against.That project in Jinshawan has the smell of a corruption scam. Reducing the tower from 200 to 50 meters destroys any hope of getting some decent energy out of it. Even the 200meter Manzanares tower in Spain was considered a small proof of concept experiment. Once these towers get big enough, efficiency is further improved by the inherent temperature difference of air at different heights.As a variant, Once you have such a tower, you can also use them in reverse. In a downdraft tower, you can pump up water and evaporate it at the top of the tower. Then the cooler and denser air will flow down though the chimneyIf you insulate the greenhouse efficiently, yes it will. It wont collect additional energy at night but you could allow less air up the chimney during the day and then, at night, use the stored heat to continue generating. The lost heat would be offset by the atmosphere being cooler at night, improving the power that can be extracted from what heat is stored.Almost all of these renewable energy schemes are corruption scams. I dont doubt that the climate is changing and pollution has ill effects, what I am saying is that this sainthood marketing a company immediately gets from a thousand creepy international NGOs if you say youre doing renewables attracts scam artists like a beacon. They are flies on rotting meat with this stuff. For every one legit person putting in a lifetime of hard work to engineer something exceedingly difficultgenerating megawatts without pollutionthere are hundreds of charlatans.Its the same problem with governmental organizations as well: lobbyists driving funding into projects that can be shown to produce little or no returns whatsoever with a simple back of the envelope calculation, get built in the name of research and development even though everyone knows its a dead end.Like, inductively charging roadways for electric vehicles. Its cool  you can make endless small scale demos to prove that it works, but once you consider how much copper it takes to make a mile of such road its instantly obvious why it will never be used. Still, publicly funded universities the world over are researching this technology with the excuse that it might be some day used  and politicians and bureaucrats fall for it every time.They were putting solar cells inside glass cylinders, so they were pointed to the east and west as well as up. Reducing the daily power generation per cell. Giving up midday light to chase morning and evening light, while driving up production cost.An idea youd expect from a half smart middle schooler, right after perpetual motion. Smart middle schoolers will also have these ideas but will understand when you explain why it wont work (as your father explained to you).That daily generation peak wasnt the goal though  put solar collection into the path of early morning and evening sun you get a much more productive solar setup using any average but mean for the whole day  its a smooth rolling hill on the graph not a needle that spikes really hard at midday with almost nothing for the rest of daylight hours. Which then nicely lines up with peoples actual consumption of that electricity  dont need storage or to import electric over longer distances to the same extent when the local solar is actually working though the all the high demand hours better.No you dont, because the sun is at a low angle and your collectors will shade each other. You have to space them further apart to remedy that, and you use twice the number of collectors to point east and west unless you use some tracking setup which also costs more money in maintenance.The little lens concepts dont have to shade each other at an angle the solar panel would really have worked at all, and being usually transparent really cant shade each other very much anyway Dude. You do lose some peak performance with those concepts, but now you get a good portion of the panels rated power even when the sun is at a very low angle  its solid state and static but with a power curve that looks rather more like it was sun tracking!That is vastly more productive for most, even if the area under the graph would end up smaller with the lensed options you need less battery as the power is more reliably available through the day, and because its more reliable through a day it also works out more reliable in general  that big storm cloud that comes over at midday really buggers up the regular PV output for that day, but wont make nearly as much difference for the lensed panel that can actually make good use of early morning light.Flat panels make sense because they are cheap, really cheap even, and that is great when you have a big grid to connect to and lots of profits to make. Not really because they get a slightly higher lower output under ideal conditions. Lets put it this way the battery we have here is on any day it isnt horribly overcast full long before midday. But was probably rather empty for breakfast (certainly would be if the grid connection did go down) when our flat solar panels are still achieving very little (though yes we have a very small battery really  wouldnt actually be able to run the baseline load of the house for 10 hours).Read the whole damn sentence  AT THE ANGLE THE PANEL WOULD ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING ANYWAY! A panel kept nearly perpendicular to the correct direction does technically make some power off the ambient but it is virtually nothing, the good output spike comes only when you are very close to perfectly sunward pointing. So as these lens are not hugely tall opaque obstacle that cast massive shadows for hours. They are infact largely transparent and usually quite small lenses They really dont shade each other during the hours the panel would do anything much anyway. Look the the power curves of such concepts and you get something that looks like you had a sun tracking rig set up from a panel that doesnt move! Clearly so very shadowing of each other Yes you do loose the peak of that panels performance, there is absolutely a cost to it, but it turns a huge power spike for a few hours either side of midday into a really nice rather smooth rolling hill that actually produces good power through all daylight hours (assuming there is sun).Those power curves are pure marketing. If you lay a panel flat down, the angle of the sun as it travels across the sky causes the solar flux density to change so it peaks in the middle of the day. If you want to make a smoother curve out of that, the only way to do it is to REMOVE power from the peak. Thats basically what they were doing in an elaborate and costly way.A cheaper way to do that is to paint a grid of thin wires over the cells so they coincide with the mid-day sun and shade it a little bit, but let light through at other times. Saves you the cost. The idea of the lenses was to capture light from very off angles, from the early morning to late evening, but there wasnt much light available there anyways and it was coming in at such a shallow angle that the lenses were in each others way.The idea that the transparent lenses dont shade each other because theyre transparent is bunk, because the whole idea of a lens is to bend light from off angles down into the panel. Either the lens wont capture the light at all from a shallow angle, which means it misses the PV cell as well, or it does and it robs the light from the next lens down the line.Thats physically impossible, because the cross-section of the stationary panel against the solar flux becomes smaller as the sun goes lower in the sky. It simply receives less light. In a sun-tracking rig this isnt the case, because the panel is always facing the sun, so the two power curves look very different.Dude the lens concepts take a really really quite narrow arc the solar cell really kicks into high gear at and makes it a much much wider arc  yes the scattering of these lenses when you are not on the ideal axis for them does loose you some performance under idea conditions at noon, but it also means you get something very much closer to noon level performance in the earlier and later parts of the day. As you are now capturing and directing that light to the panel at an angle it works better.And while yes its possible for lens to shadow a lens, what youd end up with at the angles shallow enough some light hits one lens that is in the path first is that both that lens and the next on in the line work on that ray  the lens has bent the light and might steal some with internal reflections but lots of light still gets through to the next lens even off axis. Or are you arguing that your window glass is opaque at all times but when the light is coming in perfectly on axis?Yes, the area you are catching light matters, however sun tracking rigs still dont do squat till the sun is high enough over horizon either and once it is you get a similar curve  I didnt say they had the same output power, but the CURVE is very similar. And that is because these lens do improve the capture of early/late in the day light  a solar panel isnt just a x light hits it makes y, the angle that x light hits the PV panel actually matters too! Which is why a lens on a solar panel might make that nominally 300w panel never be able to produce more than 200w, but will now when the uncovered flat panel would be producing say 40w with the lenses you are producing 140w. Its not just shaping the curve by blocking sunlight at noon!!!You dont need to build the tower straight up. You could, for example, build a tube up the side of a 1000m mountain. Straight up is more efficient as its the shortest way to achieve the required altitude difference, and the walls of the tube produce drag, but provided the whole thing is cheap enough, who cares?The main issue with that and anything like that is keeping idiots from stealing the slightly dangerous material used. Because it produces less power and requires a large area the cost of properly securing it goes way up.Sweden / Finland (or thereabouts) are finally building long term nuclear waste storage deep underground.  If that stuff gives off enough heat, it can be used to keep ventilation going (for people working there) and if some energy can be extracted on top of that, then that is an extra bonus.Science Fiction author (and Marine Biologist, PhD) Peter Watts described a somewhat similar arrangement in one of his books.  Only his hive-mind non-aristotalian thinkers somehow constrained a tornado at the top to draw air through a shorter tower.Man that guy is wacky. Great books, people should read Blindsight. His dialogue is a little meh but its a book you read for interesting concepts, not incredibly deep characters. His idea of what an interstellar intelligence would look like is probably more accurate than almost anyone elses.In the 1920s a French physicist, Bernard Dubos proposed a solar updraft chimney generator using a greenhouse for warming the air, and a 6600 foot concrete chimney of about 30 diameter to run up the side of a mountain to generate wind power.  He had designed it thinking of North Africa as an ideal site for it.If I build a 5km high chimney on the moon and fill it with air until the bottom is at 1 ATM pressure, the top will be at 1/2 ATM (the same pressure as the air on earth at 5km) because the weight of the air above it is pressing down on it.I have thought about a similar system for years, start with some location with lota of hot atr to begin with, like death valley. Make the chimney as tall as possible but make it coaxial, channel sea water via a tunnel in from the ocean making the tunnel narrower as it goes so the water can make it to the top of the chimney where it is sprayed over the outer openings cooling the exiting air making it cooler so it drops down through a second set of turbines generating more power. the water evaporating causes desalinatio to occur with thesalt falling out the moist air could be harvested to use as drinking water or for agriculture salt sold as a byproduct. if the water was brought in thugh the tunnels by gravity thats energy saved with no pumps. 2 times the power, 2 side products, 4 income streams vs. one. So what am i missing? there has to be a got you here some place!The massive fixed thermal column they create will change the regional weather patterns in hard to predict ways and that disruption could destroy sensitive ecosystems. Nuclear is much more ecologically friendly, even in worst cases case such as three eyed fish scenarios, which are entirely hypothetical anyway.Dumb question/thought: could the energy generation of this be thought of as a giant hot air balloon? Such that the power output is the lifting capacity, the tower size is the balloon size, and the greenhouse temperature is the heater. Then to increase the power, you need to make the balloon bigger while keeping the temperature the same, or you need a bigger temperature difference for the same size.I remember reading years ago that in the 1800s a man built a solar chimney onto his house. It was like a traditional chimney but the  south side of it was glass. A damper in the bottom of it opened into his house. As air heated up and rose it would draw air from the house. Fresh air from an underground passage was pulled in to replace the air traveling into and up the chimney. This was how he cooled his house. I wished someone in modern time to repeat this and measure how effective this actually was.I saw a documentary a few months back showing how tribes in the Sahara have been making houses slightly below ground, but with tall chimneys to keep cool their homes. They had been doing this for centuries.Gravity ventilation is what most houses and buildings used 100 years ago, and what many still use. It doesnt require solar chimneys  just that theres some heat source in the house to cause convection.Youd have to build something like this on what we in the UK call (not sure whether the term is the same over the pond) brown field Sites. Tearing up more farmland or forest for this kind of thing would be a definite non-starter. Were concreting over more and more of the planet on a daily basis, not to mention the solar farms that developers are throwing up all over the place.The politics of brownfield sites is weird. Weve got one that has been sitting for 20 or more years, the state couldnt find any solar investors, and now half of it is storage for CAT trucks. But the other brownfield site a couple miles away was purchased by an investor and theyre blitzing the cleanup and reconstruction. I think brownfield #2 is already zoned for industrial use which makes it easier to build on.I dont quite agree  while we dont in the UK have the huge Polytunnel Growhouses of Spain we could have them. So cover over farming land with them and stick a honking great tower up the middle to gain some electric out of it. It would almost certainly be a change in the crops grown, but I dont think it really has to mean taking productive land and making it unproductive. (though I do expect you would need to make some tradeoffs between optimal plant growth and electric production)nuclear, fossil fuels, weather(wind and solar), and geothermal/hydro if your country has the right geography for it. If you dont have access to the last one and are opposed to the second one, then the only alternative is nuclear, you cannot reliably depend on the weather for power production.A quick google suggests (in the UK) youd need 6-8 acres of land to generate roughly 1 MW of solar energy, so: 10km2 = 2471acres, 2471/8 = 308MW, likely significantly more if placed somewhere sunny like Australia.Wikipedia states that solar irradiance is about 1 kilowatt per square meter (when sunny, and it varies), and one square kilometer is 1 million square meters (10001000), therefore, your 10km2 area receives 10 million Kilowatts of energy from the sun or 10,000 MW (on a sunny day). If you only get 300 MW out of 10,000 MW possible, that would be 3% efficiency, which, compared to PV is abysmal.You mentioned UK numbers being different, does that mean that the numbers you used are normalized for cloudy days and night times? Because PV solar would also not perform well in those conditions, so, its not a fair comparison.The elephant in the room, and what everyone refuses to acknowledge with solar power is the cost of making it, because the major manufacturing costs come from refining silicon and refining glass, and the main point there is that both processes use massive amounts of energy.So, solar power is cheap because fossil fuels are cheap. If you want high grade process heat to run a silicon refinery or a glass furnace, natural gas comes in at 1-2 cents per kWh straight off the pipeline. Renewable electricity out of the grid comes at the average system costs  because these arent the kind of processes that can just be started and stopped at will   which is 10x the price at 10-20 cents and more.I had read in Popular science years ago of a similar setup using heat output from nuclear and other generation plants to fuel the turbines.  In that case it was meant as a secondary generation step using waste heat.  Certainly beats using solar thermal and the space that would take up to create the source heat.I like the multi use of this. Tower can be also used as communication tower or transmitter tower, and the greenhouse would house plant that would not survive outside in local climate or even homes that would save on heeating, just farther from the turbines. If one gets build and i get offer to live there or even work there as a engineer i would go for it.This is interesting: Wonderfully low tech requiring little more than 19th century capability, similar to a dam. But even a dam requires just the right geography and geology and, as mentioned, is quite destructive to its environment.But look at a world atlas and check out all those vast areas of cold, dry desert in Central Asia. It seems to me the economics involved may be far more favorable to this kind of power generation compared to, say, wind power (though these would likely be combined).While Im very in favor of developing proper nuclear energy, for now our society seems unable to organize and regulate  itself around anything other than maximizing profit (read greed of the few) from such investment, sacrificing safety and environment in the process. Nuclear economics also favors high density, high centralization of its consumers; just the opposite of what is found in Central Asia.Its past time we stop with the single-use structures. A tower? Chimney, cell antennae, broadcast antennae, gravity/mass energy storage system, wind turbine at the top some combination of these and more make the undertaking far more economic (and concentrate the visual pollution instead of spreading it around).Easier to design and maintain single-purpose structures? Sure it us. But look how exceedingly complex it is to build a fusion reactor, and were still chasing that. The Information Age is not over, its just becoming broader and more complicated.

During a press event on January 23rd, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) demonstrated two new robots at the mock-up facility at Japan Atomic Energy Agencys Naraha Center for Remote Control Technology Development (NARREC). As pictured by AP, one is a snake-like robot that should be able to reach very inaccessible areas, while four flying drones will be the first to enter the containment vessel of the Unit 1 reactor for inspection.These flying drones are 20 cm across, weigh 185 grams each, and were adapted from an existing model thats used for boiler inspections. At the Naraha Town facility, operators were able to practice flying it into a copy of the Unit 1s containment vessel via the piping. As the most heavily damaged unit at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, engineers are interested to learn the details of the fuel and debris that has fallen to the bottom of the vessel so that the clean-up and decontamination steps can be planned.HAD recently had an article bemoaning the use of robot for just about everything and anything with a motor. To be fair, a bristlebot is the end of a toothbrush with a pager vibrator glued on  and people call this a robot.
Hiring a project manager to create small-scale atomic reactors, called small modular reactors (SMRs), is no easy task  but Microsoft has done just that. Archana Archie Manoharan has been selected for this esteemed position. Manoharan has worked in the energy sector for over 15 years, most recently as the director of nuclear strategy and programs at Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation (USNC)  a business that creates technology development for Micro Modular Reactors (MMRs). Manoharan confirmed on LinkedIn that she has started her new role at Microsoft.Manoharan was in charge of USNCs long-term nuclear strategy and meaningful stakeholder relationships for the MMR deployments of the business. She was manager of the USNCs Department of Energy (DOE) loan program application efforts, and Microsoft will likely benefit from her knowledge there, too.The action comes after Erin Henderson was named director of nuclear development acceleration by Microsoft last week. She is a seasoned energy sector veteran who comes to Microsoft from Tennessee Valley Authority, an electricity corporation, where she served as general manager of transmission projects.Microsoft and other players in the data center space are investigating nuclear power for many significant motivations. First, they need to shift away from fossil fuels to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions; second, data centers high cost, high usage, and high energy consumption are increasing due to the need for more powerful hardware to meet the demands of artificial intelligence processing.Small modular reactors, or MMRs are attractive to Redmond because of their small size (up to 300 MW in output) and modular design. These reactors can also be installed at data center sites by being transported there and prefabricated, reducing its construction costs compared to large-scale fission reactors that power entire regions or cities.Deanna is an editor at ReadWrite.

The world is currently in the process of reevaluating its past rejection of nuclear power and is increasingly starting to view it as a reliable source of power that allows for greater energy security. This is at least in part due to the energy crisis that befell Europe after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, vindicating past worries that over-reliance on fossil fuels from autocratic regimes has made the Western countries vulnerable to political blackmail.It is now clear that Western use of natural gas and petroleum from aggressive dictatorshipswhich use cash flows from oil and gas sales to reinforce and expand their hold on powerhas backfired badly. In this context, the experience of Armeniaa small country that draws 40 percent of its energy from nuclear poweris instructive, showing how nuclear power can be instrumental in building societal reliance and political stability.Living in the dark cold. It is the winter of 19921993. As I climb the dark stairs in a freezing-cold Soviet apartment building in Yerevan, the capital of Armenia where my family and I live, the water from the two full buckets I carry is splashing down my legs and freezing on the stairs. My sister Shooshan and I, 14 and 15, are carrying water up to our 11th-floor apartment. The water to our apartment shut off weeks ago, and we get at most one hour of electricity each day. I estimate that we need exactly seven gallons of water, if we are careful, for our basic daily needs. So, we repeat the trip every day. During the precious hour when we do get electricity, my mother rushes to the kitchen to cook food for the next 24 hours. I run to the bakery, where I stand in a long queue to buy the half pound of bread that the state has rationed for each one of us.The daily routine, which goes on for the whole winter, is exhausting. But it is also empowering. As teenagers we feel that we are stronger than the disastrous conditions inflicted on us by the combination of the Soviet collapse, the Nagorno-Karabakh war, and the ensuing severe energy crisis.The reasons that my sister and Iand the thousands of other Armenian teenagers like ushad to lug water and plan their lives around the one hour of electricity during that cruel winter go back to the turbulent events that shook Armenia during the preceding decades.In the 1970s and 1980s, the Soviet Unionwhich Armenia was part ofrapidly expanded its fleet of nuclear reactors to support its growing industrial energy needs. As a result, two pressurized water reactors (PWR) of the Soviet VVER-440 type were built in the Armenian town of Metsamor, about 30 kilometers west of Yerevan. Started in 1977 and 1980, respectively, the two reactors quickly covered more than half of the energy needs of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. (The remainder of the electricity was generated by Armenias hydroelectric stations and gas-fired power plants.) The Armenia of the 1980s was a tiny but prosperous Soviet republic that prided itself in a highly educated labor force, an array of scientific institutes, and a vibrant electronics industry that produced some of the early Soviet computer mainframe designs.Chernobyl. On April 26, 1986, one of the Soviet-designed, graphite-moderated RBMK reactors at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant underwent a catastrophic power excursion that ripped the reactor open. The explosion and fire that followed propelled an enormous amount of radioactive matter into the open atmosphere leading to what is now known as the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, with widespread radioactive contamination, hundreds of deaths from acute radiation poisoning, and likely thousands of additional deaths due to radiation-induced cancers in the months and years that followed.The Chernobyl accident resonated worldwide, dramatically undermining public trust in nuclear power as a safe source of energy. The public perception of danger from nuclear power was magnified by the outrageous lies that the Soviet leadership spread about the disaster, the obvious incompetence and irresponsibility of the Soviet nuclear designers who built and operated the Chernobyl reactor, and the poorly executed cleanup efforts which were compounded by miscalculations and gross mistakes.Overnight, citizens across the Soviet Union and beyond went from a blissful ignorance about radiation to an understandableyet irrationalfear of anything radiation-related. People in Armenia, despite living more than 2,000 kilometers away from Chernobyl, started perceiving radioactive threats everywhere, often attributing many of their common ailments to radiation. Physicists, like my parents, tried to explain what radiation is and how natural doses of radiation are not dangerous. But their advice was sometimes met with hostility: Werent the builders of Chernobyl also scientists?In one chilling conversation that I witnessed at a dinner party, one of the guests told my father only half in jest, You physicists you should all be shot! To paraphrase Valery Legasovs eponymous character from HBOs five-part mini-series Chernobyl: The danger of the lies is not that we mistake them for the truth, but that when enough lies are told we lose hope in the truth and start believing in stories. (Legasov was a Soviet chemist who actively worked on the causes and consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. Concerned by the lack of nuclear safety in the Soviet nuclear industry, he died by suicide on April 27, 1988.)An earthquake, the Soviet collapse, and war. In December 1988, the devastating earthquake of Spitak killed 50,000 peoplea harrowing 2 percent of Armenias populationand destroyed most of the countrys infrastructure. The two VVER-440 reactors at Metsamor were suddenly in the public eye. Would another earthquake rip them open and turn Armenias heartland, where half of Armenias population lived, into a Chernobyl-like radioactive wasteland?To be clear, the PWRs at Metsamor are safer than the shoddily designed, graphite-moderated reactors at Chernobyl. Metsamors Soviet reactor design is close to the standard PWR designs that are still the most common reactor technology used in Western countries. And the buildings and the reactor structures were reinforced to account for Armenias seismic activity. But none of that mattered. After the Soviet governments grotesque lies about the Chernobyl disaster, the official assurances that the Metsamor reactors were safe did not convince many. Legasovs intuition was right: The pursuit for truth was replaced with belief in conspiratorial rumors. An environmentalist movement sprang up, calling for the shutdown of the Metsamor reactors. The authorities backed down, and the two reactors were turned off on February 25 and March 18, 1989.Shortly after the shutdown, the Soviet Union started to crack, finally collapsing in 1991. In neighboring Azerbaijan, an Armenian minority living in the mountainous Nagorno-Karabakh region, feeling marginalized and discriminated against, had long been fighting to protect their civil rights. With the weakening of Soviet power, the protest movement turned into demands for secession from Azerbaijan. The response in Azerbaijan was a series of brutal anti-Armenian pogroms in the cities of Sumgait and Baku that killed hundreds of Armenian civilians and forced about 300,000 others to flee the country. Fearing retaliation, the Azeri civilians living in Armenia fled en masse to Azerbaijan.A relatively peaceful political disagreement had suddenly turned into a violent conflict, with Azerbaijans pogroms against Armenians escalating to a total war against the Armenian people of Nagorno-Karabakh. As the Armenian government supported the Nagorno-Karabakh secessionists, Azerbaijan retaliated by shutting off some of the natural gas pipelines that led to Armenia. In a sense, Azerbaijans authorities did to Armenia what Russian President Vladimir Putin is now doing to Western European countries that support Ukraines war effort. With its nuclear reactors and natural gas supply shut down, Armenia was left with a reduced capacity to generate electricity.Then came the winter of 19921993. Mountain rivers froze, hydroelectric dams dried up, and suddenly hydropower too was nearly gone. Armenia was getting barely a trickle of electricity. What followed is a period now known in Armenia as tsurt u mut tariner, literally the cold and dark years: severe shortages of electricity, freezing concrete apartment complexes, closed schools, and many other disruptions. The economy collapsed, with Armenias gross domestic product contracting by an estimated 50 to 80 percent between 1990 and 1993. Then, a massive exodus followed, shrinking Armenias population by a quarter in just a few years.Nuclear power revival. The Armenian public quickly realized that, by abandoning nuclear power, it had forfeited the countrys energy independence. That vulnerability wasand still isvery effectively leveraged by its arch-enemy Azerbaijan. Was it too late to restore nuclear power?Understanding their mistake, the Armenian authorities re-evaluated their past decision. The choice was stark: Either indulge in exaggerated fears of radiation and face unpredictable consequences, or sober up and accept nuclear power as a lesser evil. Ultimately the government chose the sober option. But rather than rushing headfirst to hastily restart the Metsamor nuclear power plant, the authorities decided to make significant safety improvements to the reactors.One of the Metsamor reactors finally restarted on November 5, 1995, just before the winter season. The desperately needed 400 megawatts flowed again into the small countrys languishing power grid. Almost overnight, lights were turned on, water pumps worked again, and industries revved up to capacity. Children like my sister and I stopped their exhausting routine and Armenia became a net exporter of electricity.Over the 13 years that followed, Armenias economy grew by an unprecedented 700 percent. The difficult decision to restore nuclear power had saved Armenia and had put it on a path of development. In 2020, about 35 percent of electricity generated in Armenia came from nuclear, 25 percent came from renewables (primarily hydropower), and the remaining 40 percent from fossil fuels. (In 2021, the share of nuclear power temporarily dropped to 26 percent because the Metsamor reactor was shut down longer than usual to perform a thermal annealing of the pressure vessel, a maintenance method aimed at managing aging effects.)Despite its important contribution to the electricity mix, the nuclear power plant at Metsamor is not without problems. Mainly, like most Soviet-era PWRs, the reactor does not have the external containment building that is common with Western designs. It is also an aging machine. Because of Armenias growing energy needs, the Metsamor reactor has been issued multiple lifetime extensions. Based on current plans, Metsamors VVER-440 reactor will shut down permanently by 2036. Meanwhile the Armenian government has been busy exploring replacement alternatives, such as possibly US-built small modular reactors (SMRs), seen as a viable replacement. Armenian officials have also entered in discussions with Russia about the possibility of replacing the Soviet-era VVER-440 reactor with the much larger and more modern Russian VVER-1200 design. While the US option is not easymainly because of the lack of readiness of most SMR designsthe Russian option is particularly fraught. Armenia is reluctant to further increase its energy dependence on Russia, given Putins campaign of neo-Soviet expansionism. This is further exacerbated by the technical and economic difficulty of hosting a 1200-megawatt electric VVER-1200 unit on a grid that on average consumes only about 1,000 megawatts.Survival in the shadow of petro-dictatorship. In recent years, social scientists have studied the negative impacts of nuclear power on underprivileged communities, such as the effects of uranium mining on indigenous populations. These studies are important for understanding the social cost of this resource. However very rarely have scholars studied the positive impact that nuclear power has had in helping the victims of oppression.Most of the three million inhabitants in Armenia trace their lineage to the survivors of the Armenian Genocide of 1915. Most live near the border with the perpetrator state of Turkey, which to this day refuses to acknowledge its crime and in the recent past has actively helped Azerbaijan. Since 1993, Azerbaijan has been ruled by the Aliyev dynasty with an iron fist, strengthened by the cash flows from the export of the countrys large hydrocarbon reserves to Western countries. To further strengthen his hold on power, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev (son of Heydar Aliyev who held power in Azerbaijan for several decades) has tapped into Azerbaijanis trauma from the 1990s by demonizing Armenians and blaming all of Azerbaijans ill on this minority.Since he took power in 2003, the regime of Aliyev son has been accused of curtailing free speech and ethnic cleansing of Armenians, whereas Azerbaijans armed forces have been busy mounting a campaign of widespread cultural erasure. These decades of threats culminated in last September with a swift military attack on the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which in just one week brought the 3,000-year-old indigenous Armenian presence there effectively to an end. The situation currently is so severe that Luis Moreno Ocampo, a former chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, has warned that a new genocide may be underway.Armenians, whose newly budding democracy is under constant threat from the various authoritarian governments in the region, cannot achieve cultural and existential security if they do not have a state that ensures their security. And that includes energy security, to which nuclear power generation is key. Of course, Azerbaijan deserves to have a democratic government, too, something that is being hindered by the Western countries over-reliance on fossil fuel exports.The lessons of small nations. When it comes to understanding the value of nuclear energy, studies tend to focus on the big nuclear powers such as the United States, China, and Russia. They rarely study the experiences of small countries like Armenia. Still, the study of these insignificant players is important in terms of understanding the mistakes made, successes achieved, and lessons learned, which can be relevant for the big players as well. In a telling example, Germany is learning the hard way about the dangers of complacency when it comes to choosing between nuclear energy and fossil fuels for its energy mix: Over the last 20 years, German politicians preferred to shut down their scarybut nonetheless safenuclear power plants and increase their potentially destabilizingbut considered harmlessreliance on Russias natural gas. Had German policymakers studied Armenias experience of the 1990s, they could probably have avoided the energy crisis the country is currently experiencing.Sadly, its hard to tell whether European leaders have learned anything from Armenias struggle for energy security. In a now much-criticized statement from 2022, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called Azerbaijans dictator Ilham Aliyev a reliable partner. This gesture is now believed to have, at least partly, emboldened the Aliyev regimes brutality toward the Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh. At least for now, it is as if Europe is merely switching dictators while maintaining the same dependence on fossil fuels.Only a full reckoning by Western countries of their over-reliance on fossil fuels can put an end to the authoritarian regimes that exist only because of their hydrocarbon exports. Such a reckoning, along with the development of renewable energy and nuclear power, would lead to net gains for the climate and the environment. It would also help strengthen liberal democracies that are being unprecedently threatened.The Bulletin elevates expert voices above the noise.

I would love to visit my parents home country some day, and tour our nuclear facilities as a partner and advocate myself.Thank you for the article, indeed those years without electricity had a huge negative impact not only economical but also social and psychological. I would like also to note a historical error in the article  Armenians were living in the Autonomous Oblast of Nagorno-Karabakh, there was no such thing as region.Thank you very much for this personal and national story. Its an important addition to what many people know, and some of us who teach should use it in any related courses (I certainly will). At the same time, your numbers for mortality and cancer incidence from the Chernobyl accident are much larger than those published by the Chernobyl Forum, the most detailed and long-term source of analyses. Their results are that around 50 radiation-related deaths occurred, with possibly up to 20,000 cases of thyroid cancer (98% survival rate, but still serious in many cases).

Experts at ITER, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (and also Latin for the way, per the agency) are working to harness fusion reactions, the same energy source that powers the sun, according to the projects website.If successful, the experts in southern France could provide a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels and nuclear fission with arguably the most complex machine ever designed, ITERs communications lead Laban Coblentz told Euronews Next.Nuclear energy is far from new science, and while there have been well-reported disasters, the technology is stable with the right personnel oversight and protection from natural disasters like earthquakes. Fission is used to power the 436 nuclear reactors around the world and requires slamming neutrons into larger atoms to create energy, splitting them into smaller particles. The process does not contribute significant greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, but it does produce radioactive waste.Fusion, on the other hand, forms a heavier atom when two smaller particles slam together. The result is far more energy than fission, and without the radioactive waste, all per the United States Department of Energy.The ITER team wants to prove that the process can be industrialized. They have been at work on the project since at least 2005. Testing includes the largest magnetic confinement chamber on the planet, which the researchers call a tokamak.When complete, the chamber will weigh more than 25,000 tons, withstanding temperatures of up to 302 million degrees Fahrenheit. It creates power by using some of the hot particles to heat water, which would power a turbine via steam, all per Euronews.The project hasnt been without setbacks. The cost was originally budgeted at about $5.5 billion. But Euronews reports that its now nearly $22 billion. To stay on schedule, Coblentz told the online news agency that the experts plan to skip first plasma  a testing milestone  to get to fusion power initially in 2035.This isnt the only team working on novel nuclear projects. American icon Westinghouse is developing a small fission reactor set to go online in 2029. Its unique because its portable and can power remote locations for about eight years without water, reducing upward of 55,000 tons of air pollution annually, according to the company.Bumble announced today that it's launching a new AI-powered feature that is designed to help identify spam, scams and fake profiles.  The new tool, called Deception Detector, aims to take action on malicious content before Bumble users ever come across it.  In testing, Bumble found that the tool was able to automatically block 95% of accounts that were identified as spam or scam accounts.Large AI models -- the big troves of language, vision and audio data that power generative artificial intelligence services -- are shaping up to be as significant in the development of AI as operating systems have been in the development of smartphones: they are, in a way, looking like the platforms of the space (an idea others are noodling on, too).  Now, a Swiss startup called Jua is using that paradigm with ambitions to build out a new frontier for how AI might be used in the physical world.  It's picked up $16 million to build what it is essentially a large "physics" model for the natural world.Remote desktop software provider AnyDesk confirmed late Friday that a cyberattack allowed hackers to gain access to the companys production systems, putting the company in lockdown for almost a week.

On its website, AnyDesk claims to have more than 170,000 customers, including Comcast, LG, Samsung and Thales.
But Lise Meitner, Hahn's longtime colleague and collaborator who actually identified and scientifically explained the process of nuclear fission, was nominated for a Nobel that same year but didn't win."Every physicist knew that that was her work and she deserved that prize," Marissa Moss, a biographer of Meitner's, told Business Insider, adding that she thinks the reason Meitner was overlooked was a matter of sexism and antisemitism.She led the radiophysics division at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin. Hahn was head of radiochemistry and would later become director of the institute. They often collaborated over the years, including co-discovering the element protactinium in the late 1910s.But as Hitler came to power, Meitner's position became tenuous; she lost her professorship in 1933, and was only allowed to stay in Berlin due to her Austrian citizenship. After Germany's annexation of Austria in 1938, Meitner fled to Sweden.Meitner, exiled in Sweden, maintained correspondence with Hahn. At the urging of Meitner, he and chemist Fritz Strassman continued their experiments with uranium. Then, in December 1938, she received a letter from Hahn detailing a puzzling experimental result.Hahn's letter detailed that their experiments with bombarding uranium with neutrons seemed to be producing barium as a product. This result didn't have a ready explanation as barium is a much lighter element than uranium, and the scientists were expecting to produce heavier elements, not lighter ones.Before Meitner could respond, Hahn and Strassman published their results, but with no explanation for what they thought was occurring  and their paper made no mention of Meitner's role in the experiments."You have to understand he really couldn't mention Meitner because he couldn't be seen to be working with a Jew," Moss said. "He was already writing letters to her complaining about having worked with her tarnishing his reputation at the institute. At big institute dinners, he was seated at lesser tables, he wasn't getting the accolades he deserved, because he was working with a Jew and that wasn't a good thing."Meitner kept pondering Hahn's findings and, while discussing it with her nephew, physicist Otto Frisch, came to the idea that if an atomic nucleus is imagined as a liquid drop, perhaps energetic neutrons could actually separate the uranium nucleus into different parts and produce lighter elements  the process of nuclear fission.Meitner used Einstein's famous equation E=mc^2 to mathematically explain the reaction: The atoms produced after uranium split apart weighed slightly less than the original uranium atoms  and the missing mass had transformed into pure energy.Hahn was awarded the 1944 Nobel Prize in chemistry for the discovery of nuclear fission. Meitner was nominated in the physics category, but didn't win despite her crucial role in verifying and explaining the discovery. Strassman and Frisch were also overlooked for a Nobel.An analysis of the Nobel committee's records published in Physics Today concluded that one reason Meitner was overlooked was "a general failure of the evaluation committees to appreciate the extent to which German persecution of Jews skewed the published scientific record."Since 1901 more than 621 Nobel Prizes have been awarded in the fields of physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, peace, and economic sciences. Of those 621 awards, just 65 have gone to women  about 10%.But Hahn had spent many years downplaying Meitner's role. She was referred to as his mitarbeiterin in the German press and in a museum display of the apparatus used to detect fission  a word that "can be interpreted as assistant," Moss said.
Physics at the smallest scales is a challenge of observation: Particles are often fleeting, and the forces that govern their behavior are nearly imperceptible. But now, by exploiting decades-old data and a 50-year-old prediction about gravitys import on subatomic particles, a team of physicists has teased out a measurement for a second mechanical property in the proton.Lets slow down for a moment. A proton is a particle that, along with neutrons and electrons, makes up an atom. Protons themselves are made of even tinier particles called quarks. These quarks glom together thanks to the strong force, one of the four fundamental forces. (The other three are gravity, the weak force, and electromagnetism.) The recent team successfully measured the strong forces distribution within the proton, revealing the shear stress on the protons quarks.At its peak, this is more than a four-ton force that one would have to apply to a quark to pull it out of the proton, said Volker Burkert, principal staff scientist at Jefferson Lab and the studys lead author, in a lab release.Published in Reviews of Modern Physics, the work follows up on a 2018 measurement of the protons internal pressure. The data the team studied came out of experiments at Jefferson Labs Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility, or CEBAF, and the researchers used something called deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) to take the measurement. In DVCS, a high-energy electron is beamed at a target hydrogen proton. A quark within the proton emits a photon, which carries information about the quarks properties. DVCS also yields information on gravitys effects on matter, an idea developed in the early 2000s by the physicist Maxim Polyakov.This breakthrough in theory established the relationship between the measurement of deeply virtual Compton scattering to the gravitational form factor. And we were able to use that for the first time and extract the pressure that we did in the Nature paper in 2018, and now the normal force and the shear force, Burkert added.The data collection was something of an accident. The team was trying to do three-dimensional imaging of the scattering, but in doing so, they collected data that revealed how the strong force exerted itself on the protons insides.In my view, this is just the beginning of something much bigger to come, said study co-author Latifa Elouadhriri, a staff scientist at Jefferson Lab, in the same release. It has already changed the way we think about the structure of the proton.The scattering method can clue researchers in to proton properties that are encoded in gravitational form factors, as described by the 2023 Long Range Plan of Nuclear Science. In other words, DVCS could be an avenue for the discovery of new physics. Next, the team plans to take new measurements of the size of the proton.

NEWPORT NEWS, VA  The power of gravity is writ large across our visible universe. It can be seen in the lock step of moons as they circle planets; in wandering comets pulled off-course by massive stars; and in the swirl of gigantic galaxies. These awesome displays showcase gravitys influence at the largest scales of matter. Now, nuclear physicists are discovering that gravity also has much to offer at matters smallest scales.New research conducted by nuclear physicists at the U.S. Department of Energys Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility is using a method that connects theories of gravitation to interactions among the smallest particles of matter to reveal new details at this smaller scale. The research has now revealed, for the first time, a snapshot of the distribution of the strong force inside the proton. This snapshot details the shear stress the force may exert on the quark particles that make up the proton. The result was recently published in Reviews of Modern Physics.According to the lead author on the study, Jefferson Lab Principal Staff Scientist Volker Burkert, the measurement reveals insight into the environment experienced by the protons building blocks. Protons are built of three quarks that are bound together by the strong force.At its peak, this is more than a four-ton force that one would have to apply to a quark to pull it out of the proton, Burkert explained. Nature, of course, does not allow us to separate just one quark from the proton because of a property of quarks called color. There are three colors that mix quarks in the proton to make it appear colorless from the outside, a requirement for its existence in space. Trying to pull a colored quark out of the proton will produce a colorless quark/anti-quark pair, a meson, using the energy you put in to attempt to separate the quark, leaving a colorless proton (or neutron) behind. So, the 4-tons is an illustration of the strength of the force that is intrinsic in the proton.The result is only the second of the protons mechanical properties to be measured. The protons mechanical properties include its internal pressure (measured in 2018), its mass distribution (physical size), its angular momentum, and its shear stress (shown here). The result was made possible by a half-century-old prediction and two-decade-old data.In the mid 1960s, it was theorized that if nuclear physicists could see how gravity interacts with subatomic particles, such as the proton, such experiments could reveal the protons mechanical properties directly.But at that time, there was no way. If you compare gravity with the electromagnetic force, for instance, there is 39 orders of magnitude of difference - So it's completely hopeless, right? explained Latifa Elouadhriri, a Jefferson Lab staff scientist and co-author on the study.The decades-old data came from experiments conducted with Jefferson Labs Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF), a DOE Office of Science user facility. A typical CEBAF experiment would entail an energetic electron interacting with another particle by exchanging a packet of energy and a unit of angular momentum called a virtual photon with the particle. The energy of the electron dictates which particles it interacts with in this way and how they respond.In the experiment, a force even much greater than the four tons needed to pull out a quark/antiquark pair was applied to the proton by the highly energetic electron beam interacting with the proton in a target of liquified hydrogen gas.We developed the program to study deeply virtual Compton scattering. This is where you have an electron exchanging a virtual photon with the proton. And at the final state, the proton remained the same but recoiled, and you have one real very highly energetic photon produced, plus the scattered electron, said Elouadhriri. At the time we took the data, we were not aware that beyond the 3-dimensional imaging we intended with this data, we were also collecting the data needed for accessing the mechanical properties of the proton.It turns out that this specific process  deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS)  could be connected to how gravity interacts with matter. The general version of this connection was stated in the 1973 textbook on Einsteins general theory of relativity titled Gravitation by Charles W. Misner, Kip S. Thorne and John Archibald Wheeler.In it, they wrote, Any mass-less spin-2 field would give rise to a force indistinguishable from gravitation, because a mass-less spin-2 field would couple to the stressenergy tensor in the same way that gravitational interactions do.This breakthrough in theory established the relationship between the measurement of deeply virtual Compton scattering to the gravitational form factor. And we were able to use that for the first time and extract the pressure that we did in the Nature paper in 2018, and now the normal force and the shear force, Burkert explained.The researchers say their next step is to work on extracting the information they need from the existing DVCS data to enable the first determination of the protons mechanical size. They also hope to take advantage of newer, higher-statistics and higher-energy experiments that are continuing the DVCS research in the proton.In the meantime, the study co-authors have been amazed at the plethora of new theoretical efforts, detailed in hundreds of theoretical publications, that have begun to exploit this newly discovered avenue for exploring the mechanical properties of the proton.And also, now that we are in this new era of discovery with the 2023 Long Range Plan of Nuclear Science released recently. This will be a major pillar of the direction of science with new facilities and new detector developments. Were looking forward to seeing more of what can be done, Burkert said.Jefferson Science Associates, LLC, manages and operates the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, or Jefferson Lab, for the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Science.

A newly introduced battery called the BV100 by Chinese Betavolt Technology promises to provide half a century of power, at 100 W in a 15x15x5 mm package. Inside the package are multiple, 2 micron-thick layers nickel-63 isotope placed between 10 micron-thick diamond semiconductor, with each diamond layer using the principle of betavoltaics to induce an electrical current in a similar fashion to a solar panel using light. Ni-63 is a  emitter with a half-life of 100 years, that decays into copper-63 (Cu-63), one of the two stable forms of copper.From the batterys product page we can glean a bit more information, such as that the minimum size of the betavoltaic battery is 3x3x0.03 mm with one layer of Ni-63 and two semiconductor layers, allowing for any number of layers to be stacked to increase the power output within a given package. Also noted is that the energy conversion rate of the  energetic event is about 8.8%, which could conceivably be improved in the future.Although this battery may seem new, its actually based on a number of years of research in diamond semiconductors in betavoltaics, with V. S. Bormashov and colleagues in 2018 reporting on a similar diamond semiconductor with Ni-63 isotope layer battery. They noted a battery specific energy of 3300mWh/g. Related research by Benjian Liu and colleagues in 2018 showed an alphavoltaic battery, also using diamond semiconductor, which shows another possible avenue of development, since alpha particles are significantly more energetic.Whether well see Betavolts BV100 or similar products appear in commercial products is still uncertain, but they plan to have a 1 Watt version ready by 2025, which when packaged into the size of an average Li-ion battery pack could mean a mobile power source that will power more than a pacemaker, and cost less than the nuclear batteries powering the two Voyager spacecraft and all active Mars rovers today.The Medtronic model 9000 pacemaker was built around an RTG (thermal) generator fueled with Pu-238 rather than a betavoltaic. The most common battery for pacemakers of that era was the mercury-zinc. There were only a small number of the model 9000 produced.Ni-63 only decays into Cu-63 by beta decay, releasing 69keV of energy and an electron with ~17keV average energy (not sure where the rest of the energy goes, I guess heat). The number of disintegrations per gram per second is (ln(2)(610/63))/(10036586400) =  2.110, which would be 1.4410 keV of total energy output per second, or about 23 mW.So you would need around 43 gams of Ni-63 just to get a total power output of 1W, not accounting for the efficiency of the betavoltaic cell, which appears to be ~8% according to Wikipedia. Thats around half a kilo just for Ni-63, surely it will take a lot more mass to produce the complete cell. And thats assuming the correct number is 69keV and not 17, which would multiply the mass requirements by 4. Ni-63 isnt exactly cheap, so I dont know about that 1W cell, its certainly not for consumer market.Beta decay is a 3-body process, with the nuclei emitting a beta (high energy electron) and a neutrino/antineutrino. Only a tiny amount of energy goes into heat (recoil of the nuclei) because the nuclei is super-massive compared to electron/antineutrino (so it cant have a lot of energy b/c it would have too much momentum).The kinetic energy of the electron that gets emitted is continuous, from zero to some maximum energy: the two numbers you got are the *average* (~18 keV) and the *maximum* (~67 keV). So basically whatever energy the electron takes away (Ee=0-67 keV), the antineutrino takes the rest (En = 67 keV  Ee) to extremely good precision.Ah, I see, I didnt think about the neutrinos. Still, I wonder wether the less tan 10% efficient figure of the betavoltaic cell from Wikipedia refers to the average beta particle energy or to the total nuclear decay energy. The latter would imply they can only ever be at most 25% efficient.The efficiency is beta particle energy to electrical. Its low because even though its an electron already, electrical power isnt from higher energy electrons, its in the *field*  which means you need to convert that electron to *lots* of electrons. These work by the beta particle creating an ionization trail, which provides the electrons (extremely similar to solar cells). Hence the low efficiency: all the ionization also kicks the atoms involved, creating heat. Plus of course not all the betas even make it to the semiconductor.It is worth noting the its radioactive! fears are unfounded. These are low energy betas and cant make it out of the cell, and cant even damage the cell itself. So there are plenty of applications, just not a cellphone.Thats roughly 1500 Curies of activity.  The vaguely similar medical isotope production process for refined Mo-99 costs around $300 per Curie.  Scaling rules probably dont really apply here due to the radically different half lives, but that implies a 1-watt Ni-63 generator will require 500,000 dollars of Ni-63.  Some random google hit also tells me that Ni-63 is commercially available for $4000/gram, to that puts it at $1.2M.It is a nuclear (radioisotope) battery, much like how a lithium-ion battery is a chemical battery. Many chemical battery types are also not rechargeable, e.g. zink-air, lithium and your typical dry cell.You would need 10,000 of those 100uW batteries to provide 1W.  That would be 50m long with the 15x15mm devices.  If you increase the cross sectional area to something larger to reduce the length, you would still need 2.25m^2 volume.  The diamond semiconductor would limit the cross sectional area to maybe 0.5m^2.  Anyway, my point is that battery would be huge.  And for only 1W.  Why would they even bother?Because something approximately the size of an 18650 would produce 1mW which is plenty to power a small microcontroller and some peripherals.  Alternatively you could use it to charge a super cap that to drive a high power application that might sleep 99.9% of the time.  You could seal that up in an IP rated enclosure and have a package you could deploy in the field that would last for decades.What if you take a beta or gamma emitter and sandwich it like a capacitor between two doped semiconductors, so that the radiation emitted causes one Plate to lose electrons, and the other plate to gain electrons, so that if you connect both plates an electronic current will flowAn ESP32 in deep sleep mode (with the right board) consumes 130uA @3.3V or 430uW so youd need 4 of these batteries (about $5,000 each) to keep the memory fresh for 50 years. That is if that other nuclear phenomenon Cosmic Rays didnt flip a bunch of critical bits over those same 50 years.I see this as one small step in the search for practical long term battery technology.  Who knows where this will lead in the next 300 years.  I think it is a good step in the right direction though.   People worry way way way to much about nuclear decay solutions.Is nobody concerned about the activity of that thing? The label on the rendering states an activity of 50Ci, that number might not scare you but as someone who designed and built a Geiger Counter, who has worked with radioactive samples, let me tell you that this is absolutely insane and I would not want to go anywhere near this thing. This emits chernobyl-like levels of radiation. Maybe there are some applications for this in very remote infrastructure but even that is a bad idea as the Sovjet Union had to find out the hard way. There is no chance anyone in their right mind would use this in a portable device or generally in any generic application. I recommend to read about the Lia radiation incident, maybe that will help you to put the stated activity in relation.As someone who works radcon I can say this is safe because they are using nickle 63. It is a beta emitter only and decays into a stable isotope with no real gamma emissions to speak of. It also has a halflife of 100 years so it isnt that hot.If you do the math, ingested it will kill you 50x over. Inhaled is even worse. It takes about 67mg of the 3.3g to reach an LD50 of radiation exposure. Outside the body, though, even a plastic bottle can contain the low energy beta radiation. https://ehs.oregonstate.edu/sites/ehs.oregonstate.edu/files/pdf/rso/data_sheet_ni63.pdfIt cannot be handled like normal e-waste, thats for sure. But overall its similar to strychnine. Ingesting about 100mg of that will kill a person too. Sitting in the bottle its pretty harmless. And the absorbed Ni levels required to be acutely dangerous are so far above background as to be readily detected without radiological equipment.In the end the cost will limit the use to very specialized applications where stronger controls can be put into place. Accidents will still happen, but theyre not on the same scale as Co-60 medical equipment mishaps at 3000Ci of ~1Mev gamma radiation spewing everywhere.

Theres an upcoming movie, Argylle, about an author whose spy novels are a little too accurate, and she becomes a target of a real-life spy game. We havent seen the movie, but it made us think of a similar espionage caper from 1944 involving science fiction author Cleve Cartmill. The whole thing played out in the pages of Astounding magazine (now Analog) and involved several other science fiction luminaries ranging from John W. Campbell to Isaac Asimov. It is a great story about how science is  well, science  and no amount of secrecy or legislation can hide it.In 1943, Cartmill queried Campbell about the possibility of a story that would be known as Deadline. It wasnt his first story, nor would it be his last. But it nearly put him in a Federal prison. Why? The story dealt with an atomic bomb.By itself, thats probably not a big deal. H.G. Wells wrote The World Set Free in 1914, where he predicted nuclear weapons. But in 1914, it wasnt clear how that would work exactly. Wells mentioned uranium and thorium and wrote a reasonable account of the destructive power:When he could look down again it was like looking down upon the crater of a small volcano. In the open garden before the Imperial castle a shuddering star of evil splendor spurted and poured up smoke and flame towards them like an accusation. They were too high to distinguish people clearly, or mark the bombs effect upon the building until suddenly the facade tottered and crumbled before the flare as sugar dissolves in water.If you want to read the short story, you can do so thanks to the Internet Archive. Remember, science fiction was simpler then. The major groups in the story are the Sixa and the Seillia. If these dont mean anything to you, try spelling them backward. Presumably, war-time censors didnt. Well wait.The two groups are at war, and apparently, both have mastered the atomic bomb. While one side tries to deploy it and fails, the other side refuses, believing it to be amoral. By itself, this is just another story and means no more than Star Trek postulating a photon torpedo.All right. Im stating fact, not theory. U-235 has been separated in quantity easily sufficient for preliminary atomic-power research, and the like. They got it out of uranium ores by new atomic isotope separation methods; they now have quantities measured in pounds. By they, I mean Seilla research scientists. But they have not brought the whole amount together, or any major portion of it. Because they are not at all sure that, once started, it would stop before all of it had been consumed  in something like one micromicrosecond of time.Now the explosion of a pound of U-235, he said, wouldnt be too unbearably violent, though it releases as much energy as a hundred million pounds of TNT. Set off on an island, it might lay waste the whole island, uprooting trees, killing all animal life, but even that fifty thousand tons of TNT wouldnt seriously disturb the really unimaginable tonnage which even a small island represents.The trouble is, theyre afraid that that explosion of energy would be so incomparably violent, its sheer, minute concentration of unbearable energy so great, that surrounding matter would be set off. If you could imagine concentrating half a billion of the most violent lightning strokes you ever saw, compressing all their fury into a space less than half the size of a pack of cigarettes  youd get some idea of the concentrated essence of hyperviolence that explosion would represent. Its not simply the amount of energy; its the frightful concentration of intensity in a minute volume.The surrounding matter, unable to maintain a self-supporting atomic explosion normally, might be hyper-stimulated to atomic explosion under U-235s forces and, in the immediate neighborhood, release its energy, too. That is, the explosion would not involve only one pound of U-235, but also five or fifty or five thousand tons of other matter. The extent of the explosion is a matter of conjecture.The protagonist doing most of the speaking is on a secret mission to destroy the enemys bomb, which contains 16 pounds of U-235. He later describes using two hemispheres to separate the reaction mass and neutron shielding when the bomb is inactive.Apparently, Cartmills original idea was just some super bomb, but Campbell, who attended MIT and had a physics degree from Duke, passed him background information on atomic bombs gathered from public information.Many at Los Alamos read science fiction. In fact, it is rumored that Cambell had noticed a swell in change of address forms to New Mexico and had surmised that something was going on there, although he apparently never mentioned it.When the story came out in February 1944, workers at Los Alamos started to talk about it. After all, it had concerns very similar to their own. Should the bomb be used? It also identified separation as a major roadblock and the fear that a chain reaction might not stop.A security officer made note of the conversations and reported it to the FBI. An investigation into Cartmill and Campbell resulted. The FBI even looked into their acquaintances, including Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein.In retrospect, Cartmills bomb design probably wouldnt work, but that might not have been clear in 1944. But it did predict the problem of isotope separation and hinted at several other realistic details.The amount of effort spent on investigating the story was impressive. The FBI found that Campbell had lunch with an engineer working on an unrelated classified project and interviewed him, too. It didnt help that Campbell initially claimed all the technical content of the story was due to his influence, while Cartmill claimed he was the architect of the faux nuclear device. Later letters showed that the ideas were, in fact, Campbells.At least one investigator was convinced that some of the story had to be from classified research. However, the FBI never found a link between anyone involved and the Manhattan Project that produced the bomb. In the end, the feds forbade Campbell from running any more stories about uranium or atomic power until after the war.Yesterdays science fiction is sometimes tomorrows facts. Weve seen reasonably good approximations of cell phones, self-driving cars, virtual reality, and more. Then again, fiction doesnt anticipate everything. But just as legislators cant change the value of pi, keeping science secret is rarely effective for very long. The inquisitive nature of scientists and engineers and the fact that nature keeps no secrets on purpose make it a futile effort.You got a logic in your house. It looks like a vision receiver used to, only its got keys instead of dials, and you punch the keys for what you wanna get. Its hooked in to the tank, which has the Carson Circuit all fixed up with relays. Say you punch Station SNAFU on your logic. Relays in the tank take over an whatever vision-program SNAFU is telecastin comes on your screen  But besides that, if you punch for the weather forecast or who won todays race at Hialeah or who was the mistress of the White House durin Garfields administration or what is PDQ and R sellin for today, that comes on the screen too.The tank is described as a huge building full of relays that stores all knowledge and can do calculations.  A combination of Wikipedia, Amazon Cloud, and Google. Not bad for 1946. And now I want to name a server tank.Expanding on other early works dealing with nuclear weapons there is also Karel apeks(co-inventor of the word robot) 1924 novel Krakatit. But he focuses mostly on the politico-societal aspects of such invention and personal psychology of the inventor rather than the science & engineering of the weapon.There are stories of similar government/author interactions with Tom Clancy; they tried to put him through a military court marshal b/c of how accurate some of his writing was re: confidential information only to find out he had never been in the military.  He was able to make accurate predictions due to publicly accessible data.There is a story that when Dr Strangelove came out, the accuracy of the interior of a B-52 Stratofortress (still secret at the time I believe) was so good that there was suspicion that the filmmakers had access to something they shouldnt have.Apparently when Kubrik was filming 2001 he was warned not to include some things that NASA advisors had shown him. The Soviets could steal ideas from the USA space program from the movie. Maybe not true, neverless is plausible.Likely because the government didnt want atomic weapons to seem silly rather than because the comics got too close to reality.  And Lex Luthor throwing an atomic hand grenade at Superman is quite silly XDYep, even H.P. Lovecraft mentioned atomic weapons in some stories in the early 1930s. The Mound comes to mind, although that was written in 1929, but not published until 1940 (and not in full until the 80s). No specifics on how it would work, of course, but the authors of the time really did think it inevitable that wed weaponize nuclear technology, and therefore it was reasonable to include it in the arsenal of fictional alien civilizations.Premise: Elly Conway, an introverted spy novelist who seldom leaves her home, is drawn into the real world of espionage when the plots of her books get a little too close to the activities of a sinister underground syndicate. When Aiden, an undercover spy, shows up to save her from being kidnapped or killed, Elly and her beloved cat Alfie are plunged into a covert world where nothing, and no one, is what it seems.Release: In June 2023, it was announced that the film would be released in theaters on February 2, 2024, by Universal Pictures and Apple Original Films, before releasing on Apple TV+ at an undetermined date.Theres also Del  Reys book Nerves which describes a heck of lot, and it even describes how wed eventually use the nuclear reaction to heat water for power. In fact the significant portion of it happens to be the conclusion that if they arent careful the whole plant could explode along the lines of a Trinity et cetera type of explosion. And the book came out about the same time as that maagzine did.

Uranium prices have quadrupled over the past four years, buoyed by rising demand for nuclear power and supply challenges, but shares of uranium miners and exchange-traded funds have some catching up to do.Weekly spot uranium prices stood at $106 per pound as of Jan. 22  the highest since August 2007, according to data from nuclear-fuel market information and analysis firm UxC. Prices are trading more than four times higher than they did at the start of 2020, when prices were at $25.Those forces have been compounded by unexpected new demandchallenges in bringing on idled [and] new mine capacity, new policies affecting trade, multiple logistical constraints, [and] increasingly bullish views on nuclear and uranium in the investment community, Hinze said.The growing global acceptance of nuclear power in the green-energy transition has certainly returned the nuclear industry to a robust growth phase, said Scott Melbye, executive vice president at Uranium Energy Corp.Base load, uninterruptible power, which is what nuclear energy provides, is needed in any economic forecast, and the extremely high standards of safety culture continue to keep the probability, and impact, of an accident at the lowest levels of any available energy sources, said Melbye.Typically in a bull market, the equities will outperform the commodity price, said John Ciampaglia, chief executive of Sprott Asset Management. This hasnt been the case over the past couple of years as most uranium miners are smaller-cap stocks and investors had shifted their focus on liquidity when the [Federal Reserve] was raising interest rates.More recently, Sprott, which is the worlds largest manager of uranium investments, has seen a reversal of this trend, he told MarketWatch, with uranium miners performing better and the gains cascading to smaller-cap names.Now that uranium prices have broken above the $100-a-pound level, Sprott thinks uranium miners will generate greater investor interest, as producers are well-positioned to benefit from higher revenues and profitability, Ciampaglia said. At the same time, development-stage companies are better-positioned to raise capital to advance their projects, he said.       which provides pure-play exposure to uranium miners and physical uranium, has climbed more than 60% over the past six months, as of Wednesday. It was up 52% last year after falling nearly 12% in 2022.The biggest players are generally the safest bets, such as Uranium Energy Corp. and Cameco, though investors should be mindful of the significant gains that have already been seen in UEC shares, said Todorova.Uranium supply, meanwhile, has been in a deficit for several years, with last years primary uranium production estimated at around 140 million pounds, compared with annual nuclear-reactor requirements of 180 million pounds, Ciampaglia said.While the rally in uranium prices is incentivizing new supply, it has been a challenge to ramp up production with the restarts or expansions of previously producing mines, he said. Kazatomprom, the worlds largest producer, for example, recently said it expects to cut its 2024 production guidance because of supply-chain issues.Analysts at Bank of America led by Savita Subramanian studied earnings transcripts of companies that used the word layoff.
