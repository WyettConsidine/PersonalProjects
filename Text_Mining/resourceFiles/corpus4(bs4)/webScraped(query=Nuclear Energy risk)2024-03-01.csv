Read on to learn how sustainable investing works, some examples of sustainable investing and how to build a socially responsible investment portfolio.In general, sustainable investing can encompass a wide spectrum of investment activities that range from traditional finance to philanthropy, according to Jeff Finkelman, chartered financial analyst and managing director of sustainable investments at Fiduciary Trust International.It includes simple strategies that seek only to avoid certain industries, such as tobacco or firearms, as well as those that strive to generate positive social or environmental change with investments in renewable energy, affordable housing or any number of other challenging markets in need of capital, he said.Sustainable investors often use negative or exclusionary screening to avoid investing in companies that dont meet certain ESG criteria. Using this approach, an investor may refuse to buy a companys securities if it scores poorly compared with its peers on ESG factors.Some investors choose to exclude entire industries from their portfolios. For example, an investor may avoid sin stocks, generally defined as businesses that many people consider unethical, such as tobacco, alcohol, firearms, gambling and adult entertainment. Or you may refuse to invest in oil or nuclear energy stocks due to their environmental impact or in private prisons out of social concerns.Another approach is to use positive screening, also known as a best-in-class approach. Essentially, this is when investors look for companies and sectors that rank better on ESG factors than their peers. For instance, an investor may choose to invest only in companies that rank above at least 50% of their peers based on a number of preselected criteria.While the terms sustainable investing and ESG investing are often used interchangeably, theyre not quite the same thing. ESG investing is one type of sustainable investing, but there are several other strategies that fall under the sustainable investing umbrella.Impact investing is where you aim to achieve measurable environmental or social goals while also earning financial returns. For example, many communities in the US are considered food deserts, which means they have little access to fresh, healthy food. Investing in a grocery store or restaurant that provides healthy food in one of these communities would be a form of impact investing. The goal is to measurably improve the nutrition of residents, but you also aim to earn a profit on your investment.Another approach is to use thematic funds to invest money in a cause that matters to you. You can find mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that invest around an array of themes, such as womens leadership, clean energy and global health care. You could also invest in individual companies that are proactively working to address issues you care about.One of the big misconceptions about sustainable investing is that its less profitable than other investment approaches. The evidence is mixed, though. Some studies suggest that theres no relationship between sustainability factors and a funds performance, while others conclude that sustainable funds perform at least as well as other funds in their peer group.At the individual company level, theres evidence that adherence to sustainable principles is good for profits. Researchers at New York Universitys Stern School of Business found that sustainability initiatives at corporations are associated with more innovation, and that low carbon strategies were linked to positive financial performance.Sustainable investments may also be less risky than companies that dont have a track record of socially responsible practices. For example, a company with a strong commitment to ESG factors are less likely to be at the center of an environmental disaster, a data breach or a fraud case.Sustainable investing matters because it helps you build wealth in a way that doesnt conflict with your conscience. Many people arent comfortable investing in companies that they believe have a negative impact on the world. With sustainable investing, you can earn profits while avoiding companies that have a poor track record of hurting the environment or violating human rights. You can also proactively invest in companies and projects that are doing good in the world.There were more than 600 mutual funds and ETFs focused on sustainable investments as of 2022, according to US SIF: The Sustainable Investment Forum. Here are just a few examples of sustainable investment funds:You dont have to sacrifice profits to invest sustainably. Whether youre investing in mutual funds or ETFs or individual companies and projects, there are a number of ways to earn profits ethically. You can invest in funds or shares of companies based on whether they adhere to specific ESG criteria, or you can avoid investing in companies whose products and practices conflict with your values. Not only can you feel good about the fact that youre investing with a conscience, but some evidence suggests sustainable investing produces superior returns, particularly in the long run.You can invest sustainably by investing in ESG mutual funds and ETFs or by investing in companies that have strong ESG scores. You can also avoid companies that rank poorly on ESG criteria or that have a history of unethical practices. Some people choose to avoid certain types of companies altogether, such as those that make tobacco or firearms.Sustainable investing is a strategy where you aim to have a positive impact on the world. ESG investing and impact investing are two forms of sustainable investing. ESG investors use environmental, social and governance factors to determine whether an investment is sustainable. Impact investing is a strategy where the focus is achieving a measurable goal that benefits the planet or humanity, in addition to earning positive returns.First, make sure you define your values and what causes you care about, as well as any industries or business practices you consider unethical. If youre interested in mutual funds and ETFs, look for funds that invest according to the themes that matter to you or that screen out investments that conflict with your values. If you want to invest in individual companies, look at ESG ratings from third-party agencies, as well as those that are investing in projects you believe can have a positive long-term impact on the world.The editorial content on this page is based solely on objective, independent assessments by our writers and is not influenced by advertising or partnerships.

Chris Sharp is the chief technology officer at Digital Realty, a US business at the intersection of construction and high-tech. It builds data centres, the anonymous warehouses full of computers that keep the online world spinning.Meanwhile, universities, such as the UK's Imperial College London, have for years operated small nuclear reactors for teaching and training purposes. Imperial's own reactor, located just outside London, was operational from 1965 to 2010.Today most companies developing SMRs for commercial use are focusing on helping towns and cities to keep their lights on. However, a clutch of specialist firms have decided that data centres are the best candidates for their SMR designs.In the US, one SMR design from a company called NuScale has already been given the go-ahead by the Office of Nuclear Energy. Meanwhile, in the UK the Office for Nuclear Regulation is continuing to study SMR designs from Rolls-Royce and US tech firm Holtec International.Spencer Lamb, chief commercial officer at British data centre developer Kao Data, doesn't view nuclear-powered facilities in the UK as being something imminent. "I've heard about SMRs, but it will take a long time to deploy a nuclear-configured data centre in the UK, and AI is happening now," he says."People question the viability of nuclear power due to the waste product and risk of an accident," says Mr Gitt. "We recycle the fuel through our reactor multiple times, dealing with the waste, and the new reactors cannot melt-down, they are self-cooling and self-regulating."Mr Gitt declines to reveal if any data centre firms have already signed contracts, but he says that "all the major operators are interested". He adds: "Power is their biggest problem, and they want to deploy this technology within four years, by 2028."So what will a data centre's very own nuclear plant look like? Oklo envisages a large stainless steel tank that contains the SMR dropped into a 50ft (15m) deep hole in the ground. The data centre would then constructed on and around it.
You may have heard that Elon Musks company Neuralink surgically implanted a brain chip in its first human. Dubbed Telepathy, the chip uses neurotechnology in a medical context: It aims to read signals from a paralyzed patients brain and transmit them to a computer, enabling the patient to control it with just their thoughts. In a medical context, neurotech is subject to federal regulations.But researchers are also creating noninvasive neurotech. Already, there are AI-powered brain decoders that can translate into text the unspoken thoughts swirling through our minds, without the need for surgery  although this tech is not yet on the market. In the meantime, you can buy lots of devices off Amazon right now that would record your brain data (like the Muse headband, which uses EEG sensors to read patterns of activity in your brain, then cues you on how to improve your meditation). Since these arent marketed as medical devices, theyre not subject to federal regulations; companies can collect  and sell  your data.With Meta developing a wristband that would read your brainwaves and Apple patenting a future version of AirPods that would scan your brain activity through your ears, we could soon live in a world where companies harvest our neural data just as 23andMe harvests our DNA data. These companies could conceivably build databases with tens of millions of brain scans, which can be used to find out if someone has a disease like epilepsy even when they dont want that information disclosed  and could one day be used to identify individuals against their will.In the US, the action is so far happening on the state level. The Colorado House passed legislation this month that would amend the states privacy law to include the privacy of neural data. Its the first state to take that step. The bill had impressive bipartisan support, though it could still change before its enacted.Minnesota may be next. The state doesnt have a comprehensive privacy law to amend, but its legislature is considering a standalone bill that would protect mental privacy and slap penalties on companies that violate its prohibitions.But preventing a company from harvesting brain data in one state or country is not that useful if it can just do that elsewhere. The holy grail would be federal  or even global  legislation. So, how do we protect mental privacy worldwide?Rafael Yuste, a Columbia University neuroscientist, started to get freaked out by his own neurotech research a dozen years ago. At his lab, employing a method called optogenetics, he found that he could manipulate the visual perception of mice by using a laser to activate specific neurons in the visual cortex of the brain. When he made certain images artificially appear in their brains, the mice behaved as though the images were real. Yuste discovered he could run them like puppets.In 2017, Yuste gathered around 30 experts to meet at Columbias Morningside campus, where they spent days discussing the ethics of neurotech. As Yustes mouse experiments showed, its not just mental privacy thats at stake; theres also the risk of someone using neurotechnology to manipulate our minds. While some brain-computer interfaces only aim to read whats happening in your brain, others also aim to write to the brain  that is, to directly change what your neurons are up to.The group of experts, now known as the Morningside Group, published a Nature paper later that year making four policy recommendations, which Yuste later expanded to five. Think of them as new human rights for the age of neurotechnology:So Yuste connected with Jared Genser, an international human rights lawyer who has represented clients like the Nobel Peace Prize laureates Desmond Tutu and Aung San Suu Kyi. Together, Yuste and Genser created a nonprofit called the Neurorights Foundation to advocate for the cause.They soon notched a major win. In 2021, after Yuste helped craft a constitutional amendment with a close friend who happened to be a Chilean senator, Chile became the first nation to enshrine the right to mental privacy and the right to free will in its national constitution. Mexico, Brazil, and Uruguay are already considering something similar.Ultimately, Yuste wants a new international treaty on neurorights and a new international agency to make sure countries comply with it. He imagines the creation of something like the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors the use of nuclear energy. But establishing a new global treaty is probably too ambitious as an opening gambit, so for now, he and Genser are exploring other possibilities.Were not saying that there necessarily need to be new human rights created, Genser told me, explaining that he sees a lot of promise in simply updating current interpretations of human rights law  for example, extending the right to privacy to include mental privacy.Thats relevant both on the international level  hes talking to the UN about updating the provision on privacy that appears in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  and on the national and state levels. While not every nation will amend its constitution, states with a comprehensive privacy law could amend that to cover mental privacy.Thats the path Colorado is taking. If US federal law were to follow Colorado in recognizing neural data as sensitive health data, that data would fall under the protection of HIPAA, which Yuste said would alleviate much of his concern. Another possibility would be to get all neurotech devices recognized as medical devices so they would have to be approved by the FDA.At Vox, we believe that clarity is power, and that power shouldnt only be available to those who can afford to pay.

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and Kairos Power have signed a Technology Investment Agreement to implement an Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) risk reduction award, for which the company was selected in December 2020, to support the design, construction, and commissioning of the Hermes demonstration reactor in Oak Ridge, Tenn.Under the agreement, DOE will provide up to $303 million to Kairos Power using a performance-based, fixed-price milestone approach. The the company will receive fixed payments upon demonstrating it has achieved significant project milestones.The contracting method has been used by the Department of Defense and follows the significant precedent in NASAs successful Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program. It has proven to be a flexible and effective model to support the development and demonstration of complex technologies through federal partnerships with commercial companies.Mike Laufer, Kairos Power co-founder and CEO said in a press statement, With the use of fixed-price milestone payments, this innovative contract provides real benefits to both Kairos Power and DOE to ensure the successful completion of the Hermes reactor. It allows us to remain focused on achieving the most important goals of the project while retaining agility and flexibility to move quickly as we learn key lessons through our iterative development approach.Emphasizing the importance of the contract award, Dr. Kathryn Huff, Assistant Secretary, Office of Nuclear Energy, said in a press statement, The Hermes reactor is an important step toward realizing advanced nuclear energys role in ushering forward the nations clean energy transition, said Partnerships like this one play a significant role in making advanced nuclear technology commercially competitive.On its website the firm said it has since being selected for the ARDP award, Kairos Power has made steady progress on its pathway to demonstration, standing up extensive testing and manufacturing infrastructure to deliver the Engineering Test Unit series and advancing its fuel and molten salt coolant workstreams.In December 2023, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued a construction permit to Kairos Power for the Hermes demonstration reactor. Hermes will demonstrate the companys ability to deliver clean, safe, and affordable nuclear heat and represents a critical step on Kairos Powers iterative pathway to commercializing its advanced reactor technology.(NucNet) AtkinsRalis and state-owned Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) have signed a memorandum of understanding to collaborate on deploying Candu nuclear power reactors around the world. The MOU will be followed by collaboration and licensing agreements that will accelerate the development of Candu reactor technology, including the large-scale1,000 MW Monark designthat was unveiled in November 2023.AtkinsRalis, a Montreal-based nuclear technology and engineering company that is part of Canadas SNC-Lavalin Group, told NucNet it is aiming to deploy its firstMonark nuclear plantin Canada by about 2034-2035 and is targeting markets as far afield as South America, Asia and Australia.CANDU reactor technology was developed in Canada in the 1950s and 1960s by a partnership that included AECL. According to the Canadian Nuclear Associations website, there are 34 Candu plants globally, 30 of which are operable. Nineteen of those plants are in Canada with the rest in Argentina, China, India, Pakistan, Romania and South Korea.AtkinsRalis said as the original equipment manufacturer and steward of CANDU technology, it partners with a nationwide nuclear supply chain of more than 250 companies that employ 76,000 people and provides fuel, components, services and tooling.The Monark, at 1,000 MW, is the most advanced reactor design with the highest output of any CANDU technology. AtkinsRalis said large-scale nuclear reactors are increasingly sought-after by utilities and governments as they look to decarbonize power grids, produce stable baseload power that is not weather-dependent and increase energy security.In September, the Canadian government agreed to provide export financing to support complet4ion of two CANDU reactors in Romania. These additional plants at the Cernavoda site would take nuclear powers share of Romanias electricity production to 36%.The Indian government is in talks with Reliance Industries, Tata Power, Adani Power, and Vedanta Ltd to invest nearly $5.30 billion each from them. The report, quoting two sources, mentioned the Department of Atomic Energy and the state-run Nuclear Power Corp. of India (NPCIL) have held multiple rounds of discussions with private companies in the past year on the investment plan. The government hopes to build 11,000 megawatts (MW) of new nuclear power generation capacity by 2040.This is the first time India is pursuing private investment in nuclear power. The funding would help India achieve its target of having 50% of its installed electric generation capacity use non-fossil fuels by 2030, up from 42% now.The government is asking the private companies will make investments in the nuclear plants, acquire land and water, and undertake construction in areas outside the reactor complex of the plants. However, the responsibility and rights to build and run the power stations and their fuel management will rest with NPCIL. However, the private companies are expected to earn revenue from the power plants electricity sales, and NPCIL would operate the projects for a fee.According to a Reuters wire service report, in August 2023, Minister of State Jitendra Singh also told the countrys parliament that the government was considering options for small modular reactors, and looking at ways to allow the participation of the private sector and start-ups in such projects.India is currently building a fleet of 10 700 MW PHWR nuclear power plants using a 100% India supply chain for the domestic designed CANDU type reactor. Anther seven units are planned once the first ten are complete. India has blocked foreign direct investment in its nuclear sector by passing a supplier liability law that blocks all but state owned enterprises that self-insure. Westinghouse and GE Hitachi exited the market as a resultRussia has built and commissioned two 1000 MW VVER reactors at Kudankulam in Tamil Nadu, is building two more, and has recently completed discussions with NPCIL for a third pair at the same site. Efforts by Frances EDF to build six 1650 MW EPRs at Jaitapur on Indias west coast have been stalled for more than a decade over objections by NPCIL about costs.At $6,000/Mw the two EPR reactors would cost almost $20 billion. By comparison, India claims to be building its 700 MW PHWRs for about half that amount or about $2 billion each. Roughly speaking, India could build its entire fleet of 10 PHWRs for the cost of the twin EPRs not counting cost and schedule delays for the EPRs which have a poor track record in terms of project controls.South Korea will invest in developing its the small modular reactor (SMR) foundry business. President Yoon Suk Yeol said at a town hall meeting in Changwon that the government will develop the southeastern city ofChangwonand its surrounding area South Gyeongsang Province into an SMR manufacturing hub.Changwon will see the countrys new SMR cluster, trade, industry and energy minister Ahn Duk-geun said at the presidents town hall meeting. The city is full of companies with superb nuclear power equipment manufacturing capabilities.Since SMRs are expected to be manufactured and installed in modular forms, the plan is to produce them at factories. Given the limited number of countries with nuclear reactor manufacturing technology, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said the government will step up policy efforts to take the lead in the SMR market.The government significantly increases the budget to develop and export small modular reactors by 2028 by more than nine times to about $49 billion this year. It plans to launch South Korean SMRs in the global market. South Korea has several PWR type designs for SMRs that are in the development stage. It is also a possibility that South Korean heavy industry firms may license SMR designs already or nearly complete in other countries.The government will also offer tax benefits to SMR and nuclear power plant manufacturers. The trade ministry estimates that such tax benefits will lead to an increase in R&D spending and facility investment in the sector by more than $750 million this year alone.The government has earmarked $3 billion for next-generation nuclear power plant R&D through 2027 when President Yoons five-year term ends. This year, the government also plans to draw up a mid- to long-term policy roadmap to support the nuclear energy sector, upon legislation of the special act for the nuclear power industry.Rolls-Royce has been promoting its 470 MW PWR type mid-size reactor as a solution to the nations energy needs. The firm has presented a plans for 16 of them to be built at various sites around the nation.However, the process to select which model of small nuclear reactor, among a field of six competitors, is used in Britain has been beset by delays. Bureaucratic disputes about funding and policy issues has tied up a plan to make multiple awards of significant funding for SMRs. A prior SMR competition in 2015 ended without any significant awards of funding.As a result of the current delays,Tufan Erginbilgic, CEO at Rolls-Royce, says that the first Rolls-Royce mini nuclear reactor will be built in Europe instead of Britain if UK ministers continue on a path of failure to make up their minds about SMRs.Erginbilgic said he was confident the companys small modular reactor (SMR) technology was still far ahead of competitors. He told the Telegraph newspaper that time was running out for the UK to benefit from its first mover advantage, as Rolls has also held talks about deploying SMRs in eastern Europe.His claims about market advantage in Poland, Romania, and other countries need to be taken with grain or two of salt as several other firms including GE-Hitachi and NuScale, among others, have made inroads in developing sale prospects with these nations.Erginbilgics complaints come asGreat British Nuclear(GBN), the public body set up to lead the UKs nuclear power revival, is preparing to choose which SMR prototypes to support from a shortlist of six companies, including Rolls-Royce. GBN had promised to make the awards this spring, but that date is now in doubt according to news reports.In the UK, the company is the only SMR developer to have reached the second stage of the new generic design assessment process for nuclear reactors, with CEO Erginbilgic arguing this puts it in pole position in the GBN competition.Westinghouse Electric Company announced the signing of a contract with the Dutch government to conduct a Technical Feasibility Study (TFS) assessing the deployment of AP1000 reactors in support of their nuclear new-build strategy.This comprehensive study will evaluate deployment of two AP1000 nuclear reactors at theBorssele Nuclear Power Station. The TFS represents a significant step forward in the countrys strategy to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, aligning with the European Unions climate goals and the Dutch commitment to carbon-neutral electricity production by 2035.Borssele, in the province of Zeeland in the southwest of the Netherlands, is the countrys only commercial nuclear power station. It has a single 482-MW pressurized water reactor unit that began commercial operation in 1973. In December 2022 the Dutch government chose the Borssele site as its preferred location for the proposed construction of two new nuclear power reactor units. The government is also considering reactors from Frances EDF, South Koreas KHNP, and Westinghouse. Reactors from Russia or China are not under consideration.(NucNet) The construction of the first phase of China National Nuclear Corporations Jinqimen nuclear power station has officially begun in Zhejiang province, eastern China. The Jinqimen-1 and -2 project will have two indigenous Hualong One, or HPR1000 pressurized water reactor units.Hualong One (HPR 1000) is the 3rd-generation nuclear power brand to which China has exclusive intellectual property rights. HPR 1000 is jointly developed by the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) and the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN).It has a 177 assembly core design with an 18-month refuelling cycle with 4.45% enriched fuel. The power plants utilization rate is as high as 90%. CNNC has said its active and passive safety systems, double-layer containment and other technologies meet the highest international safety standards.Chinese state owned news media reports are that all core components are manufactured in China and that 17 universities and research institutions, 58 state-owned enterprises, and over 140 private firms across China worked on Hualong Ones development to ensure all core components were able to be produced domesticallyThe Kairos reactor is pushing-the-envelope in a whole host of technical, safety, and operational areas. The economics of the approach cannot be evaluated owing to the very high levels of uncertainty just noted.I cannot help but suspect this is yet another example of a heavily taxpayer funded DOE research effort unlikely to succeed in the commercial marketplace. The cost of the long-line of earlier DOE misadventures is in the ten-of-billions of dollars. Perhaps the scientists should take a more pragmatic approach.If you have an experience or insight to share or have learned something from a conference or seminar, your peers and colleagues on Energy Central want to hear about it.

(Article by Kevin Stocklin republished from TheEpochTimes.com) The United States has become so utterly dependent upon an uninterrupted supply of affordable electricity that, as our grid becomes ever more fragile, American society has become fragile along with it. Former CIA director James Woolsey testified before the U.S. Senate in 2015 that, if Americas electric grid were to go down for an extended period, such as one year, there are essentially two estimates on how many people would die from hunger, from starvation, from lack of water, and from social disruption. One estimate is that within a year or so, two-thirds of the United States population would die, Mr. Woolsey said. The other estimate is that within a year or so, 90 percent of the U.S. population would die. Chris Keefer, president of Canadians for Nuclear Energy, concurred. The energy grid is a civilizational life support system, and without it, modern society collapses very quickly, he said. Mr. Keefer is one of the experts featured in energy analyst, author, and documentarian Robert Bryces new film, Juice: Power, Politics and the Grid. This five-part docuseries looks at how and why America is now fragilizing and destabilizing the engineering marvel that is the central pillar of our society. We are seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, Mr. Bryce told The Epoch Times. We wanted to get people and policy makers to understand that our most important energy network is being fragilized, and we ignore this danger at our peril. Steven Pinker, author and Harvard psychology professor, wrote in a review of the book that energy is our primary defense against poverty, disorder, hunger, and death. And yet, many nations in the West have engaged in a game of Russian roulette with their power grids, in an attempt to reduce global temperatures.  A Dire Warning The warnings dont just come from the analysts featured in the documentary; electricity regulators are becoming more vocal in sounding the alarm as well. In a May 2023 report, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), charged with overseeing grid reliability, stated that a majority of Americas grid is now at heightened risk levels for outages. This report is an especially dire warning that Americas ability to keep the lights on has been jeopardized, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association CEO Jim Matheson stated. It was the near-collapse of Texass power grid during winter storm Yuri in 2021 that compelled Mr. Bryce to make the documentary. He partnered with film director Tyson Culver, who along with Mr. Bryce, experienced the crisis first-hand while living in Austin. I didnt plan to make another documentary after we made our first film that we released in 2019, he said. I just thought, I cant do this; it costs too much and takes too long. But then we learned that the [Texas] grid nearly failed, and if it had failed, tens of thousands of people would have died, he said. And we realized, if this could happen in Texas, the energy capital of the world, then the electric grid is really being undermined. The North American electric grid is rapidly being transitioned from one in which coal had once dominated to one that is seeing an ever increasing share of wind, solar, and natural gas. In the process, Americas electric grid is changing from something that was once so reliable that consumers rarely thought about it, to one that increasingly features rolling blackouts and may, one day soon, be on the brink of long-term failure.The Fatal Trifecta The destabilization of the power grid is the result of what analyst and author Meredith Angwin deems the fatal trifecta. The Texas grid almost collapsed because of what I call the fatal trifecta, Ms. Angwin states. The first part of the fatal trifecta is over reliance on renewables, which go on and off when they want to. The second part is over reliance on natural gas, which is delivered just in time and can be interrupted just in time, she says. And the third part is relying on a neighbor to help. All of these factors came into play during Texas winter storm Yuri in 2021. Wind and solar facilities were unable to deliver in freezing weather, and supplies of natural gas were interrupted by freezing temperatures as well, just as people needed electricity to heat their homes. According to a Texas comptrollers report, natural gas supplied 51 percent of Texas electricity; wind 25 percent; and coal 13 percent. As these sources went offline, utilities frantically enacted blackouts to cut demand, fearing that a mismatch of supply and demand that lasted more than several minutes would cause long-term damage to the grids hardware. While Texas missed having a months-long outage of its electric grid by only a matter of minutes, the damage from short-term outages was severe. Rolling blackouts were intended to take stress off the power grid but turned into outages thatin some parts of the statelasted several days, the report stated. In that short time, at least 210 deaths were attributed to the outage, which also caused an estimated $195 billion in economic damage. The third leg of the fatal trifecta is the ability of regions of the grid to support each other. For all its fragmented sources, utilities, and regulations, the North American power grid is interconnected in a way that allows one region to shift electricity to another region if one has an excess and the other a shortfall. Utilities routinely rely on this to balance supply and demand at any given moment. Increasingly, however, with excess reserves dwindling as coal plants are aggressively shut down across the United States, this ability to phone a friend is going away.Following Europe and California In many ways, Texas followed the lead of Europe and California in transitioning their grid to wind and solar energy, retiring coal plants and sometimes nuclear plants as well, to halt global warming and please anti-nuclear activists. Because wind and solar are weather-dependent, a dispatchable backup source is needed, and that source is typically natural gas. As Europe, California, and Texas have learned, this transition creates vulnerability compared to coal and nuclear plants, where fuel can be stored on-site. It has also led to sharply increasing prices for electricity, as dual systems of power generation need to be built, along with additional transmission infrastructure. According to a 2021 Princeton Study, relying on wind and solar to achieve net zero by 2050 would require Americas high-voltage transmission network to triple in size, at a cost of $2.4 trillion. In what appears to be a surrender, or at least a retreat, from the net-zero transition, some European countries, like Germany, are restarting their coal plants as wind and solar fail to meet demand, even at inflated prices. What we see in Europe from this misguided infatuation with renewables is a stark warning, and I think we can see the same thing in Californiaskyrocketing electricity prices and no significant reduction in CO2 to speak of, Mr. Bryce said. At the same time, the drive to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions has led to political and corporate campaigns to shift ever more products onto the electric grid. This includes such essentials as home heating, transportation, and cooking. Laws and regulations in Europe and the United States have sought to ban or phase out oil and gas heating in homes, along with gasoline-powered cars, trucks, and buses. The effect of this will be to make people more dependent on electricity while pushing up demand to levels that many say the grid cannot meet. The grid is already cracking under existing demand, Mr. Bryce said. Were seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, while these pressure groups are trying to put yet more demand on it. This is a date with disaster.Wind and Solar Devour Open Spaces Added to this is the insatiable hunger of the wind and solar industry for the consumption of land. According to a May report by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), reaching the goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050 would consume more than 250,000 square miles, or 160 million acres, of land. With current siting practices, an area the size of Texas is required to accommodate the wind and solar infrastructure we need to reach nationwide net-zero emissions by 2050, stated Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at TNC, a renewable energy advocate. Many energy experts and environmentalists are coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is the best choice to generate reliable, affordable energy, while cutting CO2 emissions. Despite headline nuclear catastrophes at plants in Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, many countries are building new plants or delaying closures of existing nuclear plants, considering it the cleanest and least environmentally harmful source of electricity. According to a report by the Nuclear Energy Institute, wind farms require up to 360 times as much land area to produce the same amount of electricity as a nuclear energy facility, and solar facilities require up to 75 times the land area. Compared to coal and natural gas plants, wind and solar consume at least 10 times as much land, according to the left-leaning Brookings Institution. In addition to a smaller footprint, nuclear power stations also typically do not require the construction of thousands of miles of new transmission lines to reach remote locations, where wind and solar facilities are typically built. With nuclear, Mr. Bryce said, we dont need to expand the grid; we can use the grid we have.Climate Activists Embrace Nuclear Even ardent supporters of green-new-deal initiatives are starting to accept that nuclear must be at least part of the plan. What were seeing out of Congress, and to some extent out of this White House, is more accommodation for nuclear energy, Mr. Bryce said. A 2022 report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reports that France, the EUs leading atomic state with nuclear weapons and fifty-six power reactors, is poised to launch a major reinvestment in nuclear power. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland are also preparing to build new nuclear reactors, the report states, while other European nationsAustria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and Portugalremain opposed to nuclear power. California regulators, meanwhile, opted in December 2023 to keep the states nuclear facility at Diablo Canyon open through at least 2030, having previously ordered its closure in 2025. This is a retreat for a state that has been plagued with rolling blackouts as it jumped headlong into a wind and solar future. If we are going to agree that climate change is an issue, with more [weather] extremes for longer, its total insanity to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather, Mr. Bryce said. We need weather-resilient, weather-resistant generation, not weather-dependent generation. With the Inflation Reduction Act and the investment tax credits, production tax credits, all of the financial incentives in the power-gen sector are to build more wind and solar, he said. To me, that is just absolute crazy town. The documentary is available to watch for free on YouTube or at juicetheseries.com. Read more at:TheEpochTimes.com(Article by Kevin Stocklin republished from TheEpochTimes.com) The United States has become so utterly dependent upon an uninterrupted supply of affordable electricity that, as our grid becomes ever more fragile, American society has become fragile along with it. Former CIA director James Woolsey testified before the U.S. Senate in 2015 that, if Americas electric grid were to go down for an extended period, such as one year, there are essentially two estimates on how many people would die from hunger, from starvation, from lack of water, and from social disruption. One estimate is that within a year or so, two-thirds of the United States population would die, Mr. Woolsey said. The other estimate is that within a year or so, 90 percent of the U.S. population would die. Chris Keefer, president of Canadians for Nuclear Energy, concurred. The energy grid is a civilizational life support system, and without it, modern society collapses very quickly, he said. Mr. Keefer is one of the experts featured in energy analyst, author, and documentarian Robert Bryces new film, Juice: Power, Politics and the Grid. This five-part docuseries looks at how and why America is now fragilizing and destabilizing the engineering marvel that is the central pillar of our society. We are seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, Mr. Bryce told The Epoch Times. We wanted to get people and policy makers to understand that our most important energy network is being fragilized, and we ignore this danger at our peril. Steven Pinker, author and Harvard psychology professor, wrote in a review of the book that energy is our primary defense against poverty, disorder, hunger, and death. And yet, many nations in the West have engaged in a game of Russian roulette with their power grids, in an attempt to reduce global temperatures.  A Dire Warning The warnings dont just come from the analysts featured in the documentary; electricity regulators are becoming more vocal in sounding the alarm as well. In a May 2023 report, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), charged with overseeing grid reliability, stated that a majority of Americas grid is now at heightened risk levels for outages. This report is an especially dire warning that Americas ability to keep the lights on has been jeopardized, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association CEO Jim Matheson stated. It was the near-collapse of Texass power grid during winter storm Yuri in 2021 that compelled Mr. Bryce to make the documentary. He partnered with film director Tyson Culver, who along with Mr. Bryce, experienced the crisis first-hand while living in Austin. I didnt plan to make another documentary after we made our first film that we released in 2019, he said. I just thought, I cant do this; it costs too much and takes too long. But then we learned that the [Texas] grid nearly failed, and if it had failed, tens of thousands of people would have died, he said. And we realized, if this could happen in Texas, the energy capital of the world, then the electric grid is really being undermined. The North American electric grid is rapidly being transitioned from one in which coal had once dominated to one that is seeing an ever increasing share of wind, solar, and natural gas. In the process, Americas electric grid is changing from something that was once so reliable that consumers rarely thought about it, to one that increasingly features rolling blackouts and may, one day soon, be on the brink of long-term failure.The Fatal Trifecta The destabilization of the power grid is the result of what analyst and author Meredith Angwin deems the fatal trifecta. The Texas grid almost collapsed because of what I call the fatal trifecta, Ms. Angwin states. The first part of the fatal trifecta is over reliance on renewables, which go on and off when they want to. The second part is over reliance on natural gas, which is delivered just in time and can be interrupted just in time, she says. And the third part is relying on a neighbor to help. All of these factors came into play during Texas winter storm Yuri in 2021. Wind and solar facilities were unable to deliver in freezing weather, and supplies of natural gas were interrupted by freezing temperatures as well, just as people needed electricity to heat their homes. According to a Texas comptrollers report, natural gas supplied 51 percent of Texas electricity; wind 25 percent; and coal 13 percent. As these sources went offline, utilities frantically enacted blackouts to cut demand, fearing that a mismatch of supply and demand that lasted more than several minutes would cause long-term damage to the grids hardware. While Texas missed having a months-long outage of its electric grid by only a matter of minutes, the damage from short-term outages was severe. Rolling blackouts were intended to take stress off the power grid but turned into outages thatin some parts of the statelasted several days, the report stated. In that short time, at least 210 deaths were attributed to the outage, which also caused an estimated $195 billion in economic damage. The third leg of the fatal trifecta is the ability of regions of the grid to support each other. For all its fragmented sources, utilities, and regulations, the North American power grid is interconnected in a way that allows one region to shift electricity to another region if one has an excess and the other a shortfall. Utilities routinely rely on this to balance supply and demand at any given moment. Increasingly, however, with excess reserves dwindling as coal plants are aggressively shut down across the United States, this ability to phone a friend is going away.Following Europe and California In many ways, Texas followed the lead of Europe and California in transitioning their grid to wind and solar energy, retiring coal plants and sometimes nuclear plants as well, to halt global warming and please anti-nuclear activists. Because wind and solar are weather-dependent, a dispatchable backup source is needed, and that source is typically natural gas. As Europe, California, and Texas have learned, this transition creates vulnerability compared to coal and nuclear plants, where fuel can be stored on-site. It has also led to sharply increasing prices for electricity, as dual systems of power generation need to be built, along with additional transmission infrastructure. According to a 2021 Princeton Study, relying on wind and solar to achieve net zero by 2050 would require Americas high-voltage transmission network to triple in size, at a cost of $2.4 trillion. In what appears to be a surrender, or at least a retreat, from the net-zero transition, some European countries, like Germany, are restarting their coal plants as wind and solar fail to meet demand, even at inflated prices. What we see in Europe from this misguided infatuation with renewables is a stark warning, and I think we can see the same thing in Californiaskyrocketing electricity prices and no significant reduction in CO2 to speak of, Mr. Bryce said. At the same time, the drive to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions has led to political and corporate campaigns to shift ever more products onto the electric grid. This includes such essentials as home heating, transportation, and cooking. Laws and regulations in Europe and the United States have sought to ban or phase out oil and gas heating in homes, along with gasoline-powered cars, trucks, and buses. The effect of this will be to make people more dependent on electricity while pushing up demand to levels that many say the grid cannot meet.

One estimate is that within a year or so, two-thirds of the United States population would die, Mr. Woolsey said. The other estimate is that within a year or so, 90 percent of the U.S. population would die. Chris Keefer, president of Canadians for Nuclear Energy, concurred. The energy grid is a civilizational life support system, and without it, modern society collapses very quickly, he said. Mr. Keefer is one of the experts featured in energy analyst, author, and documentarian Robert Bryces new film, Juice: Power, Politics and the Grid. This five-part docuseries looks at how and why America is now fragilizing and destabilizing the engineering marvel that is the central pillar of our society. We are seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, Mr. Bryce told The Epoch Times. We wanted to get people and policy makers to understand that our most important energy network is being fragilized, and we ignore this danger at our peril. Steven Pinker, author and Harvard psychology professor, wrote in a review of the book that energy is our primary defense against poverty, disorder, hunger, and death. And yet, many nations in the West have engaged in a game of Russian roulette with their power grids, in an attempt to reduce global temperatures.  A Dire Warning The warnings dont just come from the analysts featured in the documentary; electricity regulators are becoming more vocal in sounding the alarm as well. In a May 2023 report, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), charged with overseeing grid reliability, stated that a majority of Americas grid is now at heightened risk levels for outages. This report is an especially dire warning that Americas ability to keep the lights on has been jeopardized, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association CEO Jim Matheson stated. It was the near-collapse of Texass power grid during winter storm Yuri in 2021 that compelled Mr. Bryce to make the documentary. He partnered with film director Tyson Culver, who along with Mr. Bryce, experienced the crisis first-hand while living in Austin. I didnt plan to make another documentary after we made our first film that we released in 2019, he said. I just thought, I cant do this; it costs too much and takes too long. But then we learned that the [Texas] grid nearly failed, and if it had failed, tens of thousands of people would have died, he said. And we realized, if this could happen in Texas, the energy capital of the world, then the electric grid is really being undermined. The North American electric grid is rapidly being transitioned from one in which coal had once dominated to one that is seeing an ever increasing share of wind, solar, and natural gas. In the process, Americas electric grid is changing from something that was once so reliable that consumers rarely thought about it, to one that increasingly features rolling blackouts and may, one day soon, be on the brink of long-term failure.The Fatal Trifecta The destabilization of the power grid is the result of what analyst and author Meredith Angwin deems the fatal trifecta. The Texas grid almost collapsed because of what I call the fatal trifecta, Ms. Angwin states. The first part of the fatal trifecta is over reliance on renewables, which go on and off when they want to. The second part is over reliance on natural gas, which is delivered just in time and can be interrupted just in time, she says. And the third part is relying on a neighbor to help. All of these factors came into play during Texas winter storm Yuri in 2021. Wind and solar facilities were unable to deliver in freezing weather, and supplies of natural gas were interrupted by freezing temperatures as well, just as people needed electricity to heat their homes. According to a Texas comptrollers report, natural gas supplied 51 percent of Texas electricity; wind 25 percent; and coal 13 percent. As these sources went offline, utilities frantically enacted blackouts to cut demand, fearing that a mismatch of supply and demand that lasted more than several minutes would cause long-term damage to the grids hardware. While Texas missed having a months-long outage of its electric grid by only a matter of minutes, the damage from short-term outages was severe. Rolling blackouts were intended to take stress off the power grid but turned into outages thatin some parts of the statelasted several days, the report stated. In that short time, at least 210 deaths were attributed to the outage, which also caused an estimated $195 billion in economic damage. The third leg of the fatal trifecta is the ability of regions of the grid to support each other. For all its fragmented sources, utilities, and regulations, the North American power grid is interconnected in a way that allows one region to shift electricity to another region if one has an excess and the other a shortfall. Utilities routinely rely on this to balance supply and demand at any given moment. Increasingly, however, with excess reserves dwindling as coal plants are aggressively shut down across the United States, this ability to phone a friend is going away.Following Europe and California In many ways, Texas followed the lead of Europe and California in transitioning their grid to wind and solar energy, retiring coal plants and sometimes nuclear plants as well, to halt global warming and please anti-nuclear activists. Because wind and solar are weather-dependent, a dispatchable backup source is needed, and that source is typically natural gas. As Europe, California, and Texas have learned, this transition creates vulnerability compared to coal and nuclear plants, where fuel can be stored on-site. It has also led to sharply increasing prices for electricity, as dual systems of power generation need to be built, along with additional transmission infrastructure. According to a 2021 Princeton Study, relying on wind and solar to achieve net zero by 2050 would require Americas high-voltage transmission network to triple in size, at a cost of $2.4 trillion. In what appears to be a surrender, or at least a retreat, from the net-zero transition, some European countries, like Germany, are restarting their coal plants as wind and solar fail to meet demand, even at inflated prices. What we see in Europe from this misguided infatuation with renewables is a stark warning, and I think we can see the same thing in Californiaskyrocketing electricity prices and no significant reduction in CO2 to speak of, Mr. Bryce said. At the same time, the drive to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions has led to political and corporate campaigns to shift ever more products onto the electric grid. This includes such essentials as home heating, transportation, and cooking. Laws and regulations in Europe and the United States have sought to ban or phase out oil and gas heating in homes, along with gasoline-powered cars, trucks, and buses. The effect of this will be to make people more dependent on electricity while pushing up demand to levels that many say the grid cannot meet. The grid is already cracking under existing demand, Mr. Bryce said. Were seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, while these pressure groups are trying to put yet more demand on it. This is a date with disaster.Wind and Solar Devour Open Spaces Added to this is the insatiable hunger of the wind and solar industry for the consumption of land. According to a May report by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), reaching the goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050 would consume more than 250,000 square miles, or 160 million acres, of land. With current siting practices, an area the size of Texas is required to accommodate the wind and solar infrastructure we need to reach nationwide net-zero emissions by 2050, stated Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at TNC, a renewable energy advocate. Many energy experts and environmentalists are coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is the best choice to generate reliable, affordable energy, while cutting CO2 emissions. Despite headline nuclear catastrophes at plants in Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, many countries are building new plants or delaying closures of existing nuclear plants, considering it the cleanest and least environmentally harmful source of electricity. According to a report by the Nuclear Energy Institute, wind farms require up to 360 times as much land area to produce the same amount of electricity as a nuclear energy facility, and solar facilities require up to 75 times the land area. Compared to coal and natural gas plants, wind and solar consume at least 10 times as much land, according to the left-leaning Brookings Institution. In addition to a smaller footprint, nuclear power stations also typically do not require the construction of thousands of miles of new transmission lines to reach remote locations, where wind and solar facilities are typically built. With nuclear, Mr. Bryce said, we dont need to expand the grid; we can use the grid we have.Climate Activists Embrace Nuclear Even ardent supporters of green-new-deal initiatives are starting to accept that nuclear must be at least part of the plan. What were seeing out of Congress, and to some extent out of this White House, is more accommodation for nuclear energy, Mr. Bryce said. A 2022 report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reports that France, the EUs leading atomic state with nuclear weapons and fifty-six power reactors, is poised to launch a major reinvestment in nuclear power. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland are also preparing to build new nuclear reactors, the report states, while other European nationsAustria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and Portugalremain opposed to nuclear power. California regulators, meanwhile, opted in December 2023 to keep the states nuclear facility at Diablo Canyon open through at least 2030, having previously ordered its closure in 2025. This is a retreat for a state that has been plagued with rolling blackouts as it jumped headlong into a wind and solar future. If we are going to agree that climate change is an issue, with more [weather] extremes for longer, its total insanity to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather, Mr. Bryce said. We need weather-resilient, weather-resistant generation, not weather-dependent generation. With the Inflation Reduction Act and the investment tax credits, production tax credits, all of the financial incentives in the power-gen sector are to build more wind and solar, he said.

In that short time, at least 210 deaths were attributed to the outage, which also caused an estimated $195 billion in economic damage. The third leg of the fatal trifecta is the ability of regions of the grid to support each other. For all its fragmented sources, utilities, and regulations, the North American power grid is interconnected in a way that allows one region to shift electricity to another region if one has an excess and the other a shortfall. Utilities routinely rely on this to balance supply and demand at any given moment. Increasingly, however, with excess reserves dwindling as coal plants are aggressively shut down across the United States, this ability to phone a friend is going away.Following Europe and California In many ways, Texas followed the lead of Europe and California in transitioning their grid to wind and solar energy, retiring coal plants and sometimes nuclear plants as well, to halt global warming and please anti-nuclear activists. Because wind and solar are weather-dependent, a dispatchable backup source is needed, and that source is typically natural gas. As Europe, California, and Texas have learned, this transition creates vulnerability compared to coal and nuclear plants, where fuel can be stored on-site. It has also led to sharply increasing prices for electricity, as dual systems of power generation need to be built, along with additional transmission infrastructure. According to a 2021 Princeton Study, relying on wind and solar to achieve net zero by 2050 would require Americas high-voltage transmission network to triple in size, at a cost of $2.4 trillion. In what appears to be a surrender, or at least a retreat, from the net-zero transition, some European countries, like Germany, are restarting their coal plants as wind and solar fail to meet demand, even at inflated prices. What we see in Europe from this misguided infatuation with renewables is a stark warning, and I think we can see the same thing in Californiaskyrocketing electricity prices and no significant reduction in CO2 to speak of, Mr. Bryce said. At the same time, the drive to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions has led to political and corporate campaigns to shift ever more products onto the electric grid. This includes such essentials as home heating, transportation, and cooking. Laws and regulations in Europe and the United States have sought to ban or phase out oil and gas heating in homes, along with gasoline-powered cars, trucks, and buses. The effect of this will be to make people more dependent on electricity while pushing up demand to levels that many say the grid cannot meet. The grid is already cracking under existing demand, Mr. Bryce said. Were seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, while these pressure groups are trying to put yet more demand on it. This is a date with disaster.Wind and Solar Devour Open Spaces Added to this is the insatiable hunger of the wind and solar industry for the consumption of land. According to a May report by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), reaching the goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050 would consume more than 250,000 square miles, or 160 million acres, of land. With current siting practices, an area the size of Texas is required to accommodate the wind and solar infrastructure we need to reach nationwide net-zero emissions by 2050, stated Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at TNC, a renewable energy advocate. Many energy experts and environmentalists are coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is the best choice to generate reliable, affordable energy, while cutting CO2 emissions. Despite headline nuclear catastrophes at plants in Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, many countries are building new plants or delaying closures of existing nuclear plants, considering it the cleanest and least environmentally harmful source of electricity. According to a report by the Nuclear Energy Institute, wind farms require up to 360 times as much land area to produce the same amount of electricity as a nuclear energy facility, and solar facilities require up to 75 times the land area. Compared to coal and natural gas plants, wind and solar consume at least 10 times as much land, according to the left-leaning Brookings Institution. In addition to a smaller footprint, nuclear power stations also typically do not require the construction of thousands of miles of new transmission lines to reach remote locations, where wind and solar facilities are typically built. With nuclear, Mr. Bryce said, we dont need to expand the grid; we can use the grid we have.Climate Activists Embrace Nuclear Even ardent supporters of green-new-deal initiatives are starting to accept that nuclear must be at least part of the plan. What were seeing out of Congress, and to some extent out of this White House, is more accommodation for nuclear energy, Mr. Bryce said. A 2022 report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reports that France, the EUs leading atomic state with nuclear weapons and fifty-six power reactors, is poised to launch a major reinvestment in nuclear power. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland are also preparing to build new nuclear reactors, the report states, while other European nationsAustria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and Portugalremain opposed to nuclear power. California regulators, meanwhile, opted in December 2023 to keep the states nuclear facility at Diablo Canyon open through at least 2030, having previously ordered its closure in 2025. This is a retreat for a state that has been plagued with rolling blackouts as it jumped headlong into a wind and solar future. If we are going to agree that climate change is an issue, with more [weather] extremes for longer, its total insanity to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather, Mr. Bryce said. We need weather-resilient, weather-resistant generation, not weather-dependent generation. With the Inflation Reduction Act and the investment tax credits, production tax credits, all of the financial incentives in the power-gen sector are to build more wind and solar, he said. To me, that is just absolute crazy town. The documentary is available to watch for free on YouTube or at juicetheseries.com. Read more at:TheEpochTimes.comChris Keefer, president of Canadians for Nuclear Energy, concurred. The energy grid is a civilizational life support system, and without it, modern society collapses very quickly, he said. Mr. Keefer is one of the experts featured in energy analyst, author, and documentarian Robert Bryces new film, Juice: Power, Politics and the Grid. This five-part docuseries looks at how and why America is now fragilizing and destabilizing the engineering marvel that is the central pillar of our society. We are seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, Mr. Bryce told The Epoch Times. We wanted to get people and policy makers to understand that our most important energy network is being fragilized, and we ignore this danger at our peril. Steven Pinker, author and Harvard psychology professor, wrote in a review of the book that energy is our primary defense against poverty, disorder, hunger, and death. And yet, many nations in the West have engaged in a game of Russian roulette with their power grids, in an attempt to reduce global temperatures.  A Dire Warning The warnings dont just come from the analysts featured in the documentary; electricity regulators are becoming more vocal in sounding the alarm as well. In a May 2023 report, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), charged with overseeing grid reliability, stated that a majority of Americas grid is now at heightened risk levels for outages. This report is an especially dire warning that Americas ability to keep the lights on has been jeopardized, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association CEO Jim Matheson stated. It was the near-collapse of Texass power grid during winter storm Yuri in 2021 that compelled Mr. Bryce to make the documentary. He partnered with film director Tyson Culver, who along with Mr. Bryce, experienced the crisis first-hand while living in Austin. I didnt plan to make another documentary after we made our first film that we released in 2019, he said. I just thought, I cant do this; it costs too much and takes too long. But then we learned that the [Texas] grid nearly failed, and if it had failed, tens of thousands of people would have died, he said. And we realized, if this could happen in Texas, the energy capital of the world, then the electric grid is really being undermined. The North American electric grid is rapidly being transitioned from one in which coal had once dominated to one that is seeing an ever increasing share of wind, solar, and natural gas. In the process, Americas electric grid is changing from something that was once so reliable that consumers rarely thought about it, to one that increasingly features rolling blackouts and may, one day soon, be on the brink of long-term failure.The Fatal Trifecta The destabilization of the power grid is the result of what analyst and author Meredith Angwin deems the fatal trifecta. The Texas grid almost collapsed because of what I call the fatal trifecta, Ms. Angwin states. The first part of the fatal trifecta is over reliance on renewables, which go on and off when they want to. The second part is over reliance on natural gas, which is delivered just in time and can be interrupted just in time, she says. And the third part is relying on a neighbor to help. All of these factors came into play during Texas winter storm Yuri in 2021. Wind and solar facilities were unable to deliver in freezing weather, and supplies of natural gas were interrupted by freezing temperatures as well, just as people needed electricity to heat their homes. According to a Texas comptrollers report, natural gas supplied 51 percent of Texas electricity; wind 25 percent; and coal 13 percent. As these sources went offline, utilities frantically enacted blackouts to cut demand, fearing that a mismatch of supply and demand that lasted more than several minutes would cause long-term damage to the grids hardware. While Texas missed having a months-long outage of its electric grid by only a matter of minutes, the damage from short-term outages was severe. Rolling blackouts were intended to take stress off the power grid but turned into outages thatin some parts of the statelasted several days, the report stated.

To me, that is just absolute crazy town. The documentary is available to watch for free on YouTube or at juicetheseries.com.

Mr. Keefer is one of the experts featured in energy analyst, author, and documentarian Robert Bryces new film, Juice: Power, Politics and the Grid. This five-part docuseries looks at how and why America is now fragilizing and destabilizing the engineering marvel that is the central pillar of our society. We are seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, Mr. Bryce told The Epoch Times. We wanted to get people and policy makers to understand that our most important energy network is being fragilized, and we ignore this danger at our peril. Steven Pinker, author and Harvard psychology professor, wrote in a review of the book that energy is our primary defense against poverty, disorder, hunger, and death. And yet, many nations in the West have engaged in a game of Russian roulette with their power grids, in an attempt to reduce global temperatures.  A Dire Warning The warnings dont just come from the analysts featured in the documentary; electricity regulators are becoming more vocal in sounding the alarm as well. In a May 2023 report, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), charged with overseeing grid reliability, stated that a majority of Americas grid is now at heightened risk levels for outages. This report is an especially dire warning that Americas ability to keep the lights on has been jeopardized, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association CEO Jim Matheson stated. It was the near-collapse of Texass power grid during winter storm Yuri in 2021 that compelled Mr. Bryce to make the documentary. He partnered with film director Tyson Culver, who along with Mr. Bryce, experienced the crisis first-hand while living in Austin. I didnt plan to make another documentary after we made our first film that we released in 2019, he said. I just thought, I cant do this; it costs too much and takes too long. But then we learned that the [Texas] grid nearly failed, and if it had failed, tens of thousands of people would have died, he said. And we realized, if this could happen in Texas, the energy capital of the world, then the electric grid is really being undermined. The North American electric grid is rapidly being transitioned from one in which coal had once dominated to one that is seeing an ever increasing share of wind, solar, and natural gas. In the process, Americas electric grid is changing from something that was once so reliable that consumers rarely thought about it, to one that increasingly features rolling blackouts and may, one day soon, be on the brink of long-term failure.The Fatal Trifecta The destabilization of the power grid is the result of what analyst and author Meredith Angwin deems the fatal trifecta. The Texas grid almost collapsed because of what I call the fatal trifecta, Ms. Angwin states. The first part of the fatal trifecta is over reliance on renewables, which go on and off when they want to. The second part is over reliance on natural gas, which is delivered just in time and can be interrupted just in time, she says. And the third part is relying on a neighbor to help. All of these factors came into play during Texas winter storm Yuri in 2021. Wind and solar facilities were unable to deliver in freezing weather, and supplies of natural gas were interrupted by freezing temperatures as well, just as people needed electricity to heat their homes. According to a Texas comptrollers report, natural gas supplied 51 percent of Texas electricity; wind 25 percent; and coal 13 percent. As these sources went offline, utilities frantically enacted blackouts to cut demand, fearing that a mismatch of supply and demand that lasted more than several minutes would cause long-term damage to the grids hardware. While Texas missed having a months-long outage of its electric grid by only a matter of minutes, the damage from short-term outages was severe. Rolling blackouts were intended to take stress off the power grid but turned into outages thatin some parts of the statelasted several days, the report stated. In that short time, at least 210 deaths were attributed to the outage, which also caused an estimated $195 billion in economic damage. The third leg of the fatal trifecta is the ability of regions of the grid to support each other. For all its fragmented sources, utilities, and regulations, the North American power grid is interconnected in a way that allows one region to shift electricity to another region if one has an excess and the other a shortfall. Utilities routinely rely on this to balance supply and demand at any given moment. Increasingly, however, with excess reserves dwindling as coal plants are aggressively shut down across the United States, this ability to phone a friend is going away.Following Europe and California In many ways, Texas followed the lead of Europe and California in transitioning their grid to wind and solar energy, retiring coal plants and sometimes nuclear plants as well, to halt global warming and please anti-nuclear activists. Because wind and solar are weather-dependent, a dispatchable backup source is needed, and that source is typically natural gas. As Europe, California, and Texas have learned, this transition creates vulnerability compared to coal and nuclear plants, where fuel can be stored on-site. It has also led to sharply increasing prices for electricity, as dual systems of power generation need to be built, along with additional transmission infrastructure. According to a 2021 Princeton Study, relying on wind and solar to achieve net zero by 2050 would require Americas high-voltage transmission network to triple in size, at a cost of $2.4 trillion. In what appears to be a surrender, or at least a retreat, from the net-zero transition, some European countries, like Germany, are restarting their coal plants as wind and solar fail to meet demand, even at inflated prices. What we see in Europe from this misguided infatuation with renewables is a stark warning, and I think we can see the same thing in Californiaskyrocketing electricity prices and no significant reduction in CO2 to speak of, Mr. Bryce said. At the same time, the drive to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions has led to political and corporate campaigns to shift ever more products onto the electric grid. This includes such essentials as home heating, transportation, and cooking. Laws and regulations in Europe and the United States have sought to ban or phase out oil and gas heating in homes, along with gasoline-powered cars, trucks, and buses. The effect of this will be to make people more dependent on electricity while pushing up demand to levels that many say the grid cannot meet. The grid is already cracking under existing demand, Mr. Bryce said. Were seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, while these pressure groups are trying to put yet more demand on it. This is a date with disaster.Wind and Solar Devour Open Spaces Added to this is the insatiable hunger of the wind and solar industry for the consumption of land. According to a May report by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), reaching the goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050 would consume more than 250,000 square miles, or 160 million acres, of land. With current siting practices, an area the size of Texas is required to accommodate the wind and solar infrastructure we need to reach nationwide net-zero emissions by 2050, stated Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at TNC, a renewable energy advocate. Many energy experts and environmentalists are coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is the best choice to generate reliable, affordable energy, while cutting CO2 emissions. Despite headline nuclear catastrophes at plants in Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, many countries are building new plants or delaying closures of existing nuclear plants, considering it the cleanest and least environmentally harmful source of electricity. According to a report by the Nuclear Energy Institute, wind farms require up to 360 times as much land area to produce the same amount of electricity as a nuclear energy facility, and solar facilities require up to 75 times the land area. Compared to coal and natural gas plants, wind and solar consume at least 10 times as much land, according to the left-leaning Brookings Institution. In addition to a smaller footprint, nuclear power stations also typically do not require the construction of thousands of miles of new transmission lines to reach remote locations, where wind and solar facilities are typically built. With nuclear, Mr. Bryce said, we dont need to expand the grid; we can use the grid we have.Climate Activists Embrace Nuclear Even ardent supporters of green-new-deal initiatives are starting to accept that nuclear must be at least part of the plan. What were seeing out of Congress, and to some extent out of this White House, is more accommodation for nuclear energy, Mr. Bryce said. A 2022 report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reports that France, the EUs leading atomic state with nuclear weapons and fifty-six power reactors, is poised to launch a major reinvestment in nuclear power. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland are also preparing to build new nuclear reactors, the report states, while other European nationsAustria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and Portugalremain opposed to nuclear power. California regulators, meanwhile, opted in December 2023 to keep the states nuclear facility at Diablo Canyon open through at least 2030, having previously ordered its closure in 2025. This is a retreat for a state that has been plagued with rolling blackouts as it jumped headlong into a wind and solar future. If we are going to agree that climate change is an issue, with more [weather] extremes for longer, its total insanity to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather, Mr. Bryce said. We need weather-resilient, weather-resistant generation, not weather-dependent generation. With the Inflation Reduction Act and the investment tax credits, production tax credits, all of the financial incentives in the power-gen sector are to build more wind and solar, he said.

Were seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, while these pressure groups are trying to put yet more demand on it. This is a date with disaster.Wind and Solar Devour Open Spaces Added to this is the insatiable hunger of the wind and solar industry for the consumption of land. According to a May report by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), reaching the goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050 would consume more than 250,000 square miles, or 160 million acres, of land. With current siting practices, an area the size of Texas is required to accommodate the wind and solar infrastructure we need to reach nationwide net-zero emissions by 2050, stated Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at TNC, a renewable energy advocate. Many energy experts and environmentalists are coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is the best choice to generate reliable, affordable energy, while cutting CO2 emissions. Despite headline nuclear catastrophes at plants in Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, many countries are building new plants or delaying closures of existing nuclear plants, considering it the cleanest and least environmentally harmful source of electricity. According to a report by the Nuclear Energy Institute, wind farms require up to 360 times as much land area to produce the same amount of electricity as a nuclear energy facility, and solar facilities require up to 75 times the land area. Compared to coal and natural gas plants, wind and solar consume at least 10 times as much land, according to the left-leaning Brookings Institution. In addition to a smaller footprint, nuclear power stations also typically do not require the construction of thousands of miles of new transmission lines to reach remote locations, where wind and solar facilities are typically built. With nuclear, Mr. Bryce said, we dont need to expand the grid; we can use the grid we have.Climate Activists Embrace Nuclear Even ardent supporters of green-new-deal initiatives are starting to accept that nuclear must be at least part of the plan. What were seeing out of Congress, and to some extent out of this White House, is more accommodation for nuclear energy, Mr. Bryce said. A 2022 report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reports that France, the EUs leading atomic state with nuclear weapons and fifty-six power reactors, is poised to launch a major reinvestment in nuclear power. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland are also preparing to build new nuclear reactors, the report states, while other European nationsAustria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and Portugalremain opposed to nuclear power. California regulators, meanwhile, opted in December 2023 to keep the states nuclear facility at Diablo Canyon open through at least 2030, having previously ordered its closure in 2025. This is a retreat for a state that has been plagued with rolling blackouts as it jumped headlong into a wind and solar future. If we are going to agree that climate change is an issue, with more [weather] extremes for longer, its total insanity to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather, Mr. Bryce said. We need weather-resilient, weather-resistant generation, not weather-dependent generation. With the Inflation Reduction Act and the investment tax credits, production tax credits, all of the financial incentives in the power-gen sector are to build more wind and solar, he said. To me, that is just absolute crazy town. The documentary is available to watch for free on YouTube or at juicetheseries.com. Read more at:TheEpochTimes.comWe are seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, Mr. Bryce told The Epoch Times. We wanted to get people and policy makers to understand that our most important energy network is being fragilized, and we ignore this danger at our peril. Steven Pinker, author and Harvard psychology professor, wrote in a review of the book that energy is our primary defense against poverty, disorder, hunger, and death. And yet, many nations in the West have engaged in a game of Russian roulette with their power grids, in an attempt to reduce global temperatures.  A Dire Warning The warnings dont just come from the analysts featured in the documentary; electricity regulators are becoming more vocal in sounding the alarm as well. In a May 2023 report, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), charged with overseeing grid reliability, stated that a majority of Americas grid is now at heightened risk levels for outages. This report is an especially dire warning that Americas ability to keep the lights on has been jeopardized, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association CEO Jim Matheson stated. It was the near-collapse of Texass power grid during winter storm Yuri in 2021 that compelled Mr. Bryce to make the documentary. He partnered with film director Tyson Culver, who along with Mr. Bryce, experienced the crisis first-hand while living in Austin. I didnt plan to make another documentary after we made our first film that we released in 2019, he said. I just thought, I cant do this; it costs too much and takes too long. But then we learned that the [Texas] grid nearly failed, and if it had failed, tens of thousands of people would have died, he said. And we realized, if this could happen in Texas, the energy capital of the world, then the electric grid is really being undermined. The North American electric grid is rapidly being transitioned from one in which coal had once dominated to one that is seeing an ever increasing share of wind, solar, and natural gas. In the process, Americas electric grid is changing from something that was once so reliable that consumers rarely thought about it, to one that increasingly features rolling blackouts and may, one day soon, be on the brink of long-term failure.The Fatal Trifecta The destabilization of the power grid is the result of what analyst and author Meredith Angwin deems the fatal trifecta. The Texas grid almost collapsed because of what I call the fatal trifecta, Ms. Angwin states. The first part of the fatal trifecta is over reliance on renewables, which go on and off when they want to. The second part is over reliance on natural gas, which is delivered just in time and can be interrupted just in time, she says. And the third part is relying on a neighbor to help. All of these factors came into play during Texas winter storm Yuri in 2021. Wind and solar facilities were unable to deliver in freezing weather, and supplies of natural gas were interrupted by freezing temperatures as well, just as people needed electricity to heat their homes. According to a Texas comptrollers report, natural gas supplied 51 percent of Texas electricity; wind 25 percent; and coal 13 percent. As these sources went offline, utilities frantically enacted blackouts to cut demand, fearing that a mismatch of supply and demand that lasted more than several minutes would cause long-term damage to the grids hardware. While Texas missed having a months-long outage of its electric grid by only a matter of minutes, the damage from short-term outages was severe. Rolling blackouts were intended to take stress off the power grid but turned into outages thatin some parts of the statelasted several days, the report stated. In that short time, at least 210 deaths were attributed to the outage, which also caused an estimated $195 billion in economic damage. The third leg of the fatal trifecta is the ability of regions of the grid to support each other. For all its fragmented sources, utilities, and regulations, the North American power grid is interconnected in a way that allows one region to shift electricity to another region if one has an excess and the other a shortfall. Utilities routinely rely on this to balance supply and demand at any given moment. Increasingly, however, with excess reserves dwindling as coal plants are aggressively shut down across the United States, this ability to phone a friend is going away.Following Europe and California In many ways, Texas followed the lead of Europe and California in transitioning their grid to wind and solar energy, retiring coal plants and sometimes nuclear plants as well, to halt global warming and please anti-nuclear activists. Because wind and solar are weather-dependent, a dispatchable backup source is needed, and that source is typically natural gas. As Europe, California, and Texas have learned, this transition creates vulnerability compared to coal and nuclear plants, where fuel can be stored on-site. It has also led to sharply increasing prices for electricity, as dual systems of power generation need to be built, along with additional transmission infrastructure. According to a 2021 Princeton Study, relying on wind and solar to achieve net zero by 2050 would require Americas high-voltage transmission network to triple in size, at a cost of $2.4 trillion. In what appears to be a surrender, or at least a retreat, from the net-zero transition, some European countries, like Germany, are restarting their coal plants as wind and solar fail to meet demand, even at inflated prices. What we see in Europe from this misguided infatuation with renewables is a stark warning, and I think we can see the same thing in Californiaskyrocketing electricity prices and no significant reduction in CO2 to speak of, Mr. Bryce said. At the same time, the drive to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions has led to political and corporate campaigns to shift ever more products onto the electric grid. This includes such essentials as home heating, transportation, and cooking. Laws and regulations in Europe and the United States have sought to ban or phase out oil and gas heating in homes, along with gasoline-powered cars, trucks, and buses. The effect of this will be to make people more dependent on electricity while pushing up demand to levels that many say the grid cannot meet. The grid is already cracking under existing demand, Mr. Bryce said.

It has also led to sharply increasing prices for electricity, as dual systems of power generation need to be built, along with additional transmission infrastructure. According to a 2021 Princeton Study, relying on wind and solar to achieve net zero by 2050 would require Americas high-voltage transmission network to triple in size, at a cost of $2.4 trillion. In what appears to be a surrender, or at least a retreat, from the net-zero transition, some European countries, like Germany, are restarting their coal plants as wind and solar fail to meet demand, even at inflated prices. What we see in Europe from this misguided infatuation with renewables is a stark warning, and I think we can see the same thing in Californiaskyrocketing electricity prices and no significant reduction in CO2 to speak of, Mr. Bryce said. At the same time, the drive to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions has led to political and corporate campaigns to shift ever more products onto the electric grid. This includes such essentials as home heating, transportation, and cooking. Laws and regulations in Europe and the United States have sought to ban or phase out oil and gas heating in homes, along with gasoline-powered cars, trucks, and buses. The effect of this will be to make people more dependent on electricity while pushing up demand to levels that many say the grid cannot meet. The grid is already cracking under existing demand, Mr. Bryce said. Were seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, while these pressure groups are trying to put yet more demand on it. This is a date with disaster.Wind and Solar Devour Open Spaces Added to this is the insatiable hunger of the wind and solar industry for the consumption of land. According to a May report by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), reaching the goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050 would consume more than 250,000 square miles, or 160 million acres, of land. With current siting practices, an area the size of Texas is required to accommodate the wind and solar infrastructure we need to reach nationwide net-zero emissions by 2050, stated Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at TNC, a renewable energy advocate. Many energy experts and environmentalists are coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is the best choice to generate reliable, affordable energy, while cutting CO2 emissions. Despite headline nuclear catastrophes at plants in Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, many countries are building new plants or delaying closures of existing nuclear plants, considering it the cleanest and least environmentally harmful source of electricity. According to a report by the Nuclear Energy Institute, wind farms require up to 360 times as much land area to produce the same amount of electricity as a nuclear energy facility, and solar facilities require up to 75 times the land area. Compared to coal and natural gas plants, wind and solar consume at least 10 times as much land, according to the left-leaning Brookings Institution. In addition to a smaller footprint, nuclear power stations also typically do not require the construction of thousands of miles of new transmission lines to reach remote locations, where wind and solar facilities are typically built. With nuclear, Mr. Bryce said, we dont need to expand the grid; we can use the grid we have.Climate Activists Embrace Nuclear Even ardent supporters of green-new-deal initiatives are starting to accept that nuclear must be at least part of the plan. What were seeing out of Congress, and to some extent out of this White House, is more accommodation for nuclear energy, Mr. Bryce said. A 2022 report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reports that France, the EUs leading atomic state with nuclear weapons and fifty-six power reactors, is poised to launch a major reinvestment in nuclear power. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland are also preparing to build new nuclear reactors, the report states, while other European nationsAustria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and Portugalremain opposed to nuclear power. California regulators, meanwhile, opted in December 2023 to keep the states nuclear facility at Diablo Canyon open through at least 2030, having previously ordered its closure in 2025. This is a retreat for a state that has been plagued with rolling blackouts as it jumped headlong into a wind and solar future. If we are going to agree that climate change is an issue, with more [weather] extremes for longer, its total insanity to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather, Mr. Bryce said. We need weather-resilient, weather-resistant generation, not weather-dependent generation. With the Inflation Reduction Act and the investment tax credits, production tax credits, all of the financial incentives in the power-gen sector are to build more wind and solar, he said. To me, that is just absolute crazy town. The documentary is available to watch for free on YouTube or at juicetheseries.com.

A Dire Warning The warnings dont just come from the analysts featured in the documentary; electricity regulators are becoming more vocal in sounding the alarm as well. In a May 2023 report, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), charged with overseeing grid reliability, stated that a majority of Americas grid is now at heightened risk levels for outages. This report is an especially dire warning that Americas ability to keep the lights on has been jeopardized, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association CEO Jim Matheson stated. It was the near-collapse of Texass power grid during winter storm Yuri in 2021 that compelled Mr. Bryce to make the documentary. He partnered with film director Tyson Culver, who along with Mr. Bryce, experienced the crisis first-hand while living in Austin. I didnt plan to make another documentary after we made our first film that we released in 2019, he said. I just thought, I cant do this; it costs too much and takes too long. But then we learned that the [Texas] grid nearly failed, and if it had failed, tens of thousands of people would have died, he said. And we realized, if this could happen in Texas, the energy capital of the world, then the electric grid is really being undermined. The North American electric grid is rapidly being transitioned from one in which coal had once dominated to one that is seeing an ever increasing share of wind, solar, and natural gas. In the process, Americas electric grid is changing from something that was once so reliable that consumers rarely thought about it, to one that increasingly features rolling blackouts and may, one day soon, be on the brink of long-term failure.The Fatal Trifecta The destabilization of the power grid is the result of what analyst and author Meredith Angwin deems the fatal trifecta. The Texas grid almost collapsed because of what I call the fatal trifecta, Ms. Angwin states. The first part of the fatal trifecta is over reliance on renewables, which go on and off when they want to. The second part is over reliance on natural gas, which is delivered just in time and can be interrupted just in time, she says. And the third part is relying on a neighbor to help. All of these factors came into play during Texas winter storm Yuri in 2021. Wind and solar facilities were unable to deliver in freezing weather, and supplies of natural gas were interrupted by freezing temperatures as well, just as people needed electricity to heat their homes. According to a Texas comptrollers report, natural gas supplied 51 percent of Texas electricity; wind 25 percent; and coal 13 percent. As these sources went offline, utilities frantically enacted blackouts to cut demand, fearing that a mismatch of supply and demand that lasted more than several minutes would cause long-term damage to the grids hardware. While Texas missed having a months-long outage of its electric grid by only a matter of minutes, the damage from short-term outages was severe. Rolling blackouts were intended to take stress off the power grid but turned into outages thatin some parts of the statelasted several days, the report stated. In that short time, at least 210 deaths were attributed to the outage, which also caused an estimated $195 billion in economic damage. The third leg of the fatal trifecta is the ability of regions of the grid to support each other. For all its fragmented sources, utilities, and regulations, the North American power grid is interconnected in a way that allows one region to shift electricity to another region if one has an excess and the other a shortfall. Utilities routinely rely on this to balance supply and demand at any given moment. Increasingly, however, with excess reserves dwindling as coal plants are aggressively shut down across the United States, this ability to phone a friend is going away.Following Europe and California In many ways, Texas followed the lead of Europe and California in transitioning their grid to wind and solar energy, retiring coal plants and sometimes nuclear plants as well, to halt global warming and please anti-nuclear activists. Because wind and solar are weather-dependent, a dispatchable backup source is needed, and that source is typically natural gas.

Because wind and solar are weather-dependent, a dispatchable backup source is needed, and that source is typically natural gas. As Europe, California, and Texas have learned, this transition creates vulnerability compared to coal and nuclear plants, where fuel can be stored on-site. It has also led to sharply increasing prices for electricity, as dual systems of power generation need to be built, along with additional transmission infrastructure. According to a 2021 Princeton Study, relying on wind and solar to achieve net zero by 2050 would require Americas high-voltage transmission network to triple in size, at a cost of $2.4 trillion. In what appears to be a surrender, or at least a retreat, from the net-zero transition, some European countries, like Germany, are restarting their coal plants as wind and solar fail to meet demand, even at inflated prices. What we see in Europe from this misguided infatuation with renewables is a stark warning, and I think we can see the same thing in Californiaskyrocketing electricity prices and no significant reduction in CO2 to speak of, Mr. Bryce said. At the same time, the drive to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions has led to political and corporate campaigns to shift ever more products onto the electric grid. This includes such essentials as home heating, transportation, and cooking. Laws and regulations in Europe and the United States have sought to ban or phase out oil and gas heating in homes, along with gasoline-powered cars, trucks, and buses. The effect of this will be to make people more dependent on electricity while pushing up demand to levels that many say the grid cannot meet. The grid is already cracking under existing demand, Mr. Bryce said. Were seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, while these pressure groups are trying to put yet more demand on it. This is a date with disaster.Wind and Solar Devour Open Spaces Added to this is the insatiable hunger of the wind and solar industry for the consumption of land. According to a May report by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), reaching the goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050 would consume more than 250,000 square miles, or 160 million acres, of land. With current siting practices, an area the size of Texas is required to accommodate the wind and solar infrastructure we need to reach nationwide net-zero emissions by 2050, stated Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at TNC, a renewable energy advocate. Many energy experts and environmentalists are coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is the best choice to generate reliable, affordable energy, while cutting CO2 emissions. Despite headline nuclear catastrophes at plants in Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, many countries are building new plants or delaying closures of existing nuclear plants, considering it the cleanest and least environmentally harmful source of electricity. According to a report by the Nuclear Energy Institute, wind farms require up to 360 times as much land area to produce the same amount of electricity as a nuclear energy facility, and solar facilities require up to 75 times the land area. Compared to coal and natural gas plants, wind and solar consume at least 10 times as much land, according to the left-leaning Brookings Institution. In addition to a smaller footprint, nuclear power stations also typically do not require the construction of thousands of miles of new transmission lines to reach remote locations, where wind and solar facilities are typically built. With nuclear, Mr. Bryce said, we dont need to expand the grid; we can use the grid we have.Climate Activists Embrace Nuclear Even ardent supporters of green-new-deal initiatives are starting to accept that nuclear must be at least part of the plan. What were seeing out of Congress, and to some extent out of this White House, is more accommodation for nuclear energy, Mr. Bryce said. A 2022 report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reports that France, the EUs leading atomic state with nuclear weapons and fifty-six power reactors, is poised to launch a major reinvestment in nuclear power. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland are also preparing to build new nuclear reactors, the report states, while other European nationsAustria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and Portugalremain opposed to nuclear power. California regulators, meanwhile, opted in December 2023 to keep the states nuclear facility at Diablo Canyon open through at least 2030, having previously ordered its closure in 2025. This is a retreat for a state that has been plagued with rolling blackouts as it jumped headlong into a wind and solar future. If we are going to agree that climate change is an issue, with more [weather] extremes for longer, its total insanity to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather, Mr. Bryce said. We need weather-resilient, weather-resistant generation, not weather-dependent generation. With the Inflation Reduction Act and the investment tax credits, production tax credits, all of the financial incentives in the power-gen sector are to build more wind and solar, he said. To me, that is just absolute crazy town. The documentary is available to watch for free on YouTube or at juicetheseries.com. Read more at:TheEpochTimes.comThe warnings dont just come from the analysts featured in the documentary; electricity regulators are becoming more vocal in sounding the alarm as well. In a May 2023 report, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), charged with overseeing grid reliability, stated that a majority of Americas grid is now at heightened risk levels for outages. This report is an especially dire warning that Americas ability to keep the lights on has been jeopardized, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association CEO Jim Matheson stated. It was the near-collapse of Texass power grid during winter storm Yuri in 2021 that compelled Mr. Bryce to make the documentary. He partnered with film director Tyson Culver, who along with Mr. Bryce, experienced the crisis first-hand while living in Austin. I didnt plan to make another documentary after we made our first film that we released in 2019, he said. I just thought, I cant do this; it costs too much and takes too long. But then we learned that the [Texas] grid nearly failed, and if it had failed, tens of thousands of people would have died, he said. And we realized, if this could happen in Texas, the energy capital of the world, then the electric grid is really being undermined. The North American electric grid is rapidly being transitioned from one in which coal had once dominated to one that is seeing an ever increasing share of wind, solar, and natural gas. In the process, Americas electric grid is changing from something that was once so reliable that consumers rarely thought about it, to one that increasingly features rolling blackouts and may, one day soon, be on the brink of long-term failure.The Fatal Trifecta The destabilization of the power grid is the result of what analyst and author Meredith Angwin deems the fatal trifecta. The Texas grid almost collapsed because of what I call the fatal trifecta, Ms. Angwin states. The first part of the fatal trifecta is over reliance on renewables, which go on and off when they want to. The second part is over reliance on natural gas, which is delivered just in time and can be interrupted just in time, she says. And the third part is relying on a neighbor to help. All of these factors came into play during Texas winter storm Yuri in 2021. Wind and solar facilities were unable to deliver in freezing weather, and supplies of natural gas were interrupted by freezing temperatures as well, just as people needed electricity to heat their homes. According to a Texas comptrollers report, natural gas supplied 51 percent of Texas electricity; wind 25 percent; and coal 13 percent. As these sources went offline, utilities frantically enacted blackouts to cut demand, fearing that a mismatch of supply and demand that lasted more than several minutes would cause long-term damage to the grids hardware. While Texas missed having a months-long outage of its electric grid by only a matter of minutes, the damage from short-term outages was severe. Rolling blackouts were intended to take stress off the power grid but turned into outages thatin some parts of the statelasted several days, the report stated. In that short time, at least 210 deaths were attributed to the outage, which also caused an estimated $195 billion in economic damage. The third leg of the fatal trifecta is the ability of regions of the grid to support each other. For all its fragmented sources, utilities, and regulations, the North American power grid is interconnected in a way that allows one region to shift electricity to another region if one has an excess and the other a shortfall. Utilities routinely rely on this to balance supply and demand at any given moment.

According to a 2021 Princeton Study, relying on wind and solar to achieve net zero by 2050 would require Americas high-voltage transmission network to triple in size, at a cost of $2.4 trillion. In what appears to be a surrender, or at least a retreat, from the net-zero transition, some European countries, like Germany, are restarting their coal plants as wind and solar fail to meet demand, even at inflated prices. What we see in Europe from this misguided infatuation with renewables is a stark warning, and I think we can see the same thing in Californiaskyrocketing electricity prices and no significant reduction in CO2 to speak of, Mr. Bryce said. At the same time, the drive to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions has led to political and corporate campaigns to shift ever more products onto the electric grid. This includes such essentials as home heating, transportation, and cooking. Laws and regulations in Europe and the United States have sought to ban or phase out oil and gas heating in homes, along with gasoline-powered cars, trucks, and buses. The effect of this will be to make people more dependent on electricity while pushing up demand to levels that many say the grid cannot meet. The grid is already cracking under existing demand, Mr. Bryce said. Were seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, while these pressure groups are trying to put yet more demand on it. This is a date with disaster.Wind and Solar Devour Open Spaces Added to this is the insatiable hunger of the wind and solar industry for the consumption of land. According to a May report by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), reaching the goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050 would consume more than 250,000 square miles, or 160 million acres, of land. With current siting practices, an area the size of Texas is required to accommodate the wind and solar infrastructure we need to reach nationwide net-zero emissions by 2050, stated Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at TNC, a renewable energy advocate. Many energy experts and environmentalists are coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is the best choice to generate reliable, affordable energy, while cutting CO2 emissions. Despite headline nuclear catastrophes at plants in Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, many countries are building new plants or delaying closures of existing nuclear plants, considering it the cleanest and least environmentally harmful source of electricity. According to a report by the Nuclear Energy Institute, wind farms require up to 360 times as much land area to produce the same amount of electricity as a nuclear energy facility, and solar facilities require up to 75 times the land area. Compared to coal and natural gas plants, wind and solar consume at least 10 times as much land, according to the left-leaning Brookings Institution. In addition to a smaller footprint, nuclear power stations also typically do not require the construction of thousands of miles of new transmission lines to reach remote locations, where wind and solar facilities are typically built. With nuclear, Mr. Bryce said, we dont need to expand the grid; we can use the grid we have.Climate Activists Embrace Nuclear Even ardent supporters of green-new-deal initiatives are starting to accept that nuclear must be at least part of the plan. What were seeing out of Congress, and to some extent out of this White House, is more accommodation for nuclear energy, Mr. Bryce said. A 2022 report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reports that France, the EUs leading atomic state with nuclear weapons and fifty-six power reactors, is poised to launch a major reinvestment in nuclear power. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland are also preparing to build new nuclear reactors, the report states, while other European nationsAustria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and Portugalremain opposed to nuclear power. California regulators, meanwhile, opted in December 2023 to keep the states nuclear facility at Diablo Canyon open through at least 2030, having previously ordered its closure in 2025. This is a retreat for a state that has been plagued with rolling blackouts as it jumped headlong into a wind and solar future. If we are going to agree that climate change is an issue, with more [weather] extremes for longer, its total insanity to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather, Mr. Bryce said. We need weather-resilient, weather-resistant generation, not weather-dependent generation. With the Inflation Reduction Act and the investment tax credits, production tax credits, all of the financial incentives in the power-gen sector are to build more wind and solar, he said. To me, that is just absolute crazy town. The documentary is available to watch for free on YouTube or at juicetheseries.com. Read more at:TheEpochTimes.comThis report is an especially dire warning that Americas ability to keep the lights on has been jeopardized, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association CEO Jim Matheson stated. It was the near-collapse of Texass power grid during winter storm Yuri in 2021 that compelled Mr. Bryce to make the documentary. He partnered with film director Tyson Culver, who along with Mr. Bryce, experienced the crisis first-hand while living in Austin. I didnt plan to make another documentary after we made our first film that we released in 2019, he said. I just thought, I cant do this; it costs too much and takes too long. But then we learned that the [Texas] grid nearly failed, and if it had failed, tens of thousands of people would have died, he said. And we realized, if this could happen in Texas, the energy capital of the world, then the electric grid is really being undermined. The North American electric grid is rapidly being transitioned from one in which coal had once dominated to one that is seeing an ever increasing share of wind, solar, and natural gas. In the process, Americas electric grid is changing from something that was once so reliable that consumers rarely thought about it, to one that increasingly features rolling blackouts and may, one day soon, be on the brink of long-term failure.The Fatal Trifecta The destabilization of the power grid is the result of what analyst and author Meredith Angwin deems the fatal trifecta. The Texas grid almost collapsed because of what I call the fatal trifecta, Ms. Angwin states. The first part of the fatal trifecta is over reliance on renewables, which go on and off when they want to. The second part is over reliance on natural gas, which is delivered just in time and can be interrupted just in time, she says. And the third part is relying on a neighbor to help. All of these factors came into play during Texas winter storm Yuri in 2021. Wind and solar facilities were unable to deliver in freezing weather, and supplies of natural gas were interrupted by freezing temperatures as well, just as people needed electricity to heat their homes. According to a Texas comptrollers report, natural gas supplied 51 percent of Texas electricity; wind 25 percent; and coal 13 percent. As these sources went offline, utilities frantically enacted blackouts to cut demand, fearing that a mismatch of supply and demand that lasted more than several minutes would cause long-term damage to the grids hardware. While Texas missed having a months-long outage of its electric grid by only a matter of minutes, the damage from short-term outages was severe. Rolling blackouts were intended to take stress off the power grid but turned into outages thatin some parts of the statelasted several days, the report stated. In that short time, at least 210 deaths were attributed to the outage, which also caused an estimated $195 billion in economic damage. The third leg of the fatal trifecta is the ability of regions of the grid to support each other. For all its fragmented sources, utilities, and regulations, the North American power grid is interconnected in a way that allows one region to shift electricity to another region if one has an excess and the other a shortfall. Utilities routinely rely on this to balance supply and demand at any given moment. Increasingly, however, with excess reserves dwindling as coal plants are aggressively shut down across the United States, this ability to phone a friend is going away.Following Europe and California In many ways, Texas followed the lead of Europe and California in transitioning their grid to wind and solar energy, retiring coal plants and sometimes nuclear plants as well, to halt global warming and please anti-nuclear activists. Because wind and solar are weather-dependent, a dispatchable backup source is needed, and that source is typically natural gas.

With current siting practices, an area the size of Texas is required to accommodate the wind and solar infrastructure we need to reach nationwide net-zero emissions by 2050, stated Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at TNC, a renewable energy advocate. Many energy experts and environmentalists are coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is the best choice to generate reliable, affordable energy, while cutting CO2 emissions. Despite headline nuclear catastrophes at plants in Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, many countries are building new plants or delaying closures of existing nuclear plants, considering it the cleanest and least environmentally harmful source of electricity. According to a report by the Nuclear Energy Institute, wind farms require up to 360 times as much land area to produce the same amount of electricity as a nuclear energy facility, and solar facilities require up to 75 times the land area. Compared to coal and natural gas plants, wind and solar consume at least 10 times as much land, according to the left-leaning Brookings Institution. In addition to a smaller footprint, nuclear power stations also typically do not require the construction of thousands of miles of new transmission lines to reach remote locations, where wind and solar facilities are typically built. With nuclear, Mr. Bryce said, we dont need to expand the grid; we can use the grid we have.Climate Activists Embrace Nuclear Even ardent supporters of green-new-deal initiatives are starting to accept that nuclear must be at least part of the plan. What were seeing out of Congress, and to some extent out of this White House, is more accommodation for nuclear energy, Mr. Bryce said. A 2022 report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reports that France, the EUs leading atomic state with nuclear weapons and fifty-six power reactors, is poised to launch a major reinvestment in nuclear power. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland are also preparing to build new nuclear reactors, the report states, while other European nationsAustria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and Portugalremain opposed to nuclear power. California regulators, meanwhile, opted in December 2023 to keep the states nuclear facility at Diablo Canyon open through at least 2030, having previously ordered its closure in 2025. This is a retreat for a state that has been plagued with rolling blackouts as it jumped headlong into a wind and solar future. If we are going to agree that climate change is an issue, with more [weather] extremes for longer, its total insanity to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather, Mr. Bryce said. We need weather-resilient, weather-resistant generation, not weather-dependent generation. With the Inflation Reduction Act and the investment tax credits, production tax credits, all of the financial incentives in the power-gen sector are to build more wind and solar, he said. To me, that is just absolute crazy town. The documentary is available to watch for free on YouTube or at juicetheseries.com. Read more at:TheEpochTimes.comI didnt plan to make another documentary after we made our first film that we released in 2019, he said. I just thought, I cant do this; it costs too much and takes too long. But then we learned that the [Texas] grid nearly failed, and if it had failed, tens of thousands of people would have died, he said. And we realized, if this could happen in Texas, the energy capital of the world, then the electric grid is really being undermined. The North American electric grid is rapidly being transitioned from one in which coal had once dominated to one that is seeing an ever increasing share of wind, solar, and natural gas. In the process, Americas electric grid is changing from something that was once so reliable that consumers rarely thought about it, to one that increasingly features rolling blackouts and may, one day soon, be on the brink of long-term failure.The Fatal Trifecta The destabilization of the power grid is the result of what analyst and author Meredith Angwin deems the fatal trifecta. The Texas grid almost collapsed because of what I call the fatal trifecta, Ms. Angwin states. The first part of the fatal trifecta is over reliance on renewables, which go on and off when they want to. The second part is over reliance on natural gas, which is delivered just in time and can be interrupted just in time, she says. And the third part is relying on a neighbor to help. All of these factors came into play during Texas winter storm Yuri in 2021. Wind and solar facilities were unable to deliver in freezing weather, and supplies of natural gas were interrupted by freezing temperatures as well, just as people needed electricity to heat their homes. According to a Texas comptrollers report, natural gas supplied 51 percent of Texas electricity; wind 25 percent; and coal 13 percent. As these sources went offline, utilities frantically enacted blackouts to cut demand, fearing that a mismatch of supply and demand that lasted more than several minutes would cause long-term damage to the grids hardware. While Texas missed having a months-long outage of its electric grid by only a matter of minutes, the damage from short-term outages was severe. Rolling blackouts were intended to take stress off the power grid but turned into outages thatin some parts of the statelasted several days, the report stated. In that short time, at least 210 deaths were attributed to the outage, which also caused an estimated $195 billion in economic damage. The third leg of the fatal trifecta is the ability of regions of the grid to support each other. For all its fragmented sources, utilities, and regulations, the North American power grid is interconnected in a way that allows one region to shift electricity to another region if one has an excess and the other a shortfall. Utilities routinely rely on this to balance supply and demand at any given moment. Increasingly, however, with excess reserves dwindling as coal plants are aggressively shut down across the United States, this ability to phone a friend is going away.Following Europe and California In many ways, Texas followed the lead of Europe and California in transitioning their grid to wind and solar energy, retiring coal plants and sometimes nuclear plants as well, to halt global warming and please anti-nuclear activists. Because wind and solar are weather-dependent, a dispatchable backup source is needed, and that source is typically natural gas. As Europe, California, and Texas have learned, this transition creates vulnerability compared to coal and nuclear plants, where fuel can be stored on-site. It has also led to sharply increasing prices for electricity, as dual systems of power generation need to be built, along with additional transmission infrastructure. According to a 2021 Princeton Study, relying on wind and solar to achieve net zero by 2050 would require Americas high-voltage transmission network to triple in size, at a cost of $2.4 trillion. In what appears to be a surrender, or at least a retreat, from the net-zero transition, some European countries, like Germany, are restarting their coal plants as wind and solar fail to meet demand, even at inflated prices. What we see in Europe from this misguided infatuation with renewables is a stark warning, and I think we can see the same thing in Californiaskyrocketing electricity prices and no significant reduction in CO2 to speak of, Mr. Bryce said. At the same time, the drive to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions has led to political and corporate campaigns to shift ever more products onto the electric grid. This includes such essentials as home heating, transportation, and cooking. Laws and regulations in Europe and the United States have sought to ban or phase out oil and gas heating in homes, along with gasoline-powered cars, trucks, and buses. The effect of this will be to make people more dependent on electricity while pushing up demand to levels that many say the grid cannot meet. The grid is already cracking under existing demand, Mr. Bryce said. Were seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, while these pressure groups are trying to put yet more demand on it.

The second part is over reliance on natural gas, which is delivered just in time and can be interrupted just in time, she says. And the third part is relying on a neighbor to help. All of these factors came into play during Texas winter storm Yuri in 2021. Wind and solar facilities were unable to deliver in freezing weather, and supplies of natural gas were interrupted by freezing temperatures as well, just as people needed electricity to heat their homes. According to a Texas comptrollers report, natural gas supplied 51 percent of Texas electricity; wind 25 percent; and coal 13 percent. As these sources went offline, utilities frantically enacted blackouts to cut demand, fearing that a mismatch of supply and demand that lasted more than several minutes would cause long-term damage to the grids hardware. While Texas missed having a months-long outage of its electric grid by only a matter of minutes, the damage from short-term outages was severe. Rolling blackouts were intended to take stress off the power grid but turned into outages thatin some parts of the statelasted several days, the report stated. In that short time, at least 210 deaths were attributed to the outage, which also caused an estimated $195 billion in economic damage. The third leg of the fatal trifecta is the ability of regions of the grid to support each other. For all its fragmented sources, utilities, and regulations, the North American power grid is interconnected in a way that allows one region to shift electricity to another region if one has an excess and the other a shortfall. Utilities routinely rely on this to balance supply and demand at any given moment. Increasingly, however, with excess reserves dwindling as coal plants are aggressively shut down across the United States, this ability to phone a friend is going away.Following Europe and California In many ways, Texas followed the lead of Europe and California in transitioning their grid to wind and solar energy, retiring coal plants and sometimes nuclear plants as well, to halt global warming and please anti-nuclear activists. Because wind and solar are weather-dependent, a dispatchable backup source is needed, and that source is typically natural gas. As Europe, California, and Texas have learned, this transition creates vulnerability compared to coal and nuclear plants, where fuel can be stored on-site. It has also led to sharply increasing prices for electricity, as dual systems of power generation need to be built, along with additional transmission infrastructure. According to a 2021 Princeton Study, relying on wind and solar to achieve net zero by 2050 would require Americas high-voltage transmission network to triple in size, at a cost of $2.4 trillion. In what appears to be a surrender, or at least a retreat, from the net-zero transition, some European countries, like Germany, are restarting their coal plants as wind and solar fail to meet demand, even at inflated prices. What we see in Europe from this misguided infatuation with renewables is a stark warning, and I think we can see the same thing in Californiaskyrocketing electricity prices and no significant reduction in CO2 to speak of, Mr. Bryce said. At the same time, the drive to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions has led to political and corporate campaigns to shift ever more products onto the electric grid. This includes such essentials as home heating, transportation, and cooking. Laws and regulations in Europe and the United States have sought to ban or phase out oil and gas heating in homes, along with gasoline-powered cars, trucks, and buses. The effect of this will be to make people more dependent on electricity while pushing up demand to levels that many say the grid cannot meet. The grid is already cracking under existing demand, Mr. Bryce said. Were seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, while these pressure groups are trying to put yet more demand on it. This is a date with disaster.Wind and Solar Devour Open Spaces Added to this is the insatiable hunger of the wind and solar industry for the consumption of land. According to a May report by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), reaching the goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050 would consume more than 250,000 square miles, or 160 million acres, of land. With current siting practices, an area the size of Texas is required to accommodate the wind and solar infrastructure we need to reach nationwide net-zero emissions by 2050, stated Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at TNC, a renewable energy advocate. Many energy experts and environmentalists are coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is the best choice to generate reliable, affordable energy, while cutting CO2 emissions. Despite headline nuclear catastrophes at plants in Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, many countries are building new plants or delaying closures of existing nuclear plants, considering it the cleanest and least environmentally harmful source of electricity. According to a report by the Nuclear Energy Institute, wind farms require up to 360 times as much land area to produce the same amount of electricity as a nuclear energy facility, and solar facilities require up to 75 times the land area. Compared to coal and natural gas plants, wind and solar consume at least 10 times as much land, according to the left-leaning Brookings Institution. In addition to a smaller footprint, nuclear power stations also typically do not require the construction of thousands of miles of new transmission lines to reach remote locations, where wind and solar facilities are typically built. With nuclear, Mr. Bryce said, we dont need to expand the grid; we can use the grid we have.Climate Activists Embrace Nuclear Even ardent supporters of green-new-deal initiatives are starting to accept that nuclear must be at least part of the plan. What were seeing out of Congress, and to some extent out of this White House, is more accommodation for nuclear energy, Mr. Bryce said. A 2022 report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reports that France, the EUs leading atomic state with nuclear weapons and fifty-six power reactors, is poised to launch a major reinvestment in nuclear power. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland are also preparing to build new nuclear reactors, the report states, while other European nationsAustria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and Portugalremain opposed to nuclear power. California regulators, meanwhile, opted in December 2023 to keep the states nuclear facility at Diablo Canyon open through at least 2030, having previously ordered its closure in 2025. This is a retreat for a state that has been plagued with rolling blackouts as it jumped headlong into a wind and solar future. If we are going to agree that climate change is an issue, with more [weather] extremes for longer, its total insanity to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather, Mr. Bryce said. We need weather-resilient, weather-resistant generation, not weather-dependent generation. With the Inflation Reduction Act and the investment tax credits, production tax credits, all of the financial incentives in the power-gen sector are to build more wind and solar, he said.

With the Inflation Reduction Act and the investment tax credits, production tax credits, all of the financial incentives in the power-gen sector are to build more wind and solar, he said. To me, that is just absolute crazy town. The documentary is available to watch for free on YouTube or at juicetheseries.com. Read more at:TheEpochTimes.comThe second part is over reliance on natural gas, which is delivered just in time and can be interrupted just in time, she says. And the third part is relying on a neighbor to help. All of these factors came into play during Texas winter storm Yuri in 2021. Wind and solar facilities were unable to deliver in freezing weather, and supplies of natural gas were interrupted by freezing temperatures as well, just as people needed electricity to heat their homes. According to a Texas comptrollers report, natural gas supplied 51 percent of Texas electricity; wind 25 percent; and coal 13 percent. As these sources went offline, utilities frantically enacted blackouts to cut demand, fearing that a mismatch of supply and demand that lasted more than several minutes would cause long-term damage to the grids hardware. While Texas missed having a months-long outage of its electric grid by only a matter of minutes, the damage from short-term outages was severe. Rolling blackouts were intended to take stress off the power grid but turned into outages thatin some parts of the statelasted several days, the report stated. In that short time, at least 210 deaths were attributed to the outage, which also caused an estimated $195 billion in economic damage. The third leg of the fatal trifecta is the ability of regions of the grid to support each other. For all its fragmented sources, utilities, and regulations, the North American power grid is interconnected in a way that allows one region to shift electricity to another region if one has an excess and the other a shortfall. Utilities routinely rely on this to balance supply and demand at any given moment. Increasingly, however, with excess reserves dwindling as coal plants are aggressively shut down across the United States, this ability to phone a friend is going away.Following Europe and California In many ways, Texas followed the lead of Europe and California in transitioning their grid to wind and solar energy, retiring coal plants and sometimes nuclear plants as well, to halt global warming and please anti-nuclear activists. Because wind and solar are weather-dependent, a dispatchable backup source is needed, and that source is typically natural gas. As Europe, California, and Texas have learned, this transition creates vulnerability compared to coal and nuclear plants, where fuel can be stored on-site. It has also led to sharply increasing prices for electricity, as dual systems of power generation need to be built, along with additional transmission infrastructure. According to a 2021 Princeton Study, relying on wind and solar to achieve net zero by 2050 would require Americas high-voltage transmission network to triple in size, at a cost of $2.4 trillion. In what appears to be a surrender, or at least a retreat, from the net-zero transition, some European countries, like Germany, are restarting their coal plants as wind and solar fail to meet demand, even at inflated prices. What we see in Europe from this misguided infatuation with renewables is a stark warning, and I think we can see the same thing in Californiaskyrocketing electricity prices and no significant reduction in CO2 to speak of, Mr. Bryce said. At the same time, the drive to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions has led to political and corporate campaigns to shift ever more products onto the electric grid. This includes such essentials as home heating, transportation, and cooking. Laws and regulations in Europe and the United States have sought to ban or phase out oil and gas heating in homes, along with gasoline-powered cars, trucks, and buses. The effect of this will be to make people more dependent on electricity while pushing up demand to levels that many say the grid cannot meet. The grid is already cracking under existing demand, Mr. Bryce said. Were seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, while these pressure groups are trying to put yet more demand on it. This is a date with disaster.Wind and Solar Devour Open Spaces Added to this is the insatiable hunger of the wind and solar industry for the consumption of land. According to a May report by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), reaching the goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050 would consume more than 250,000 square miles, or 160 million acres, of land. With current siting practices, an area the size of Texas is required to accommodate the wind and solar infrastructure we need to reach nationwide net-zero emissions by 2050, stated Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at TNC, a renewable energy advocate. Many energy experts and environmentalists are coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is the best choice to generate reliable, affordable energy, while cutting CO2 emissions. Despite headline nuclear catastrophes at plants in Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, many countries are building new plants or delaying closures of existing nuclear plants, considering it the cleanest and least environmentally harmful source of electricity. According to a report by the Nuclear Energy Institute, wind farms require up to 360 times as much land area to produce the same amount of electricity as a nuclear energy facility, and solar facilities require up to 75 times the land area. Compared to coal and natural gas plants, wind and solar consume at least 10 times as much land, according to the left-leaning Brookings Institution. In addition to a smaller footprint, nuclear power stations also typically do not require the construction of thousands of miles of new transmission lines to reach remote locations, where wind and solar facilities are typically built. With nuclear, Mr. Bryce said, we dont need to expand the grid; we can use the grid we have.Climate Activists Embrace Nuclear Even ardent supporters of green-new-deal initiatives are starting to accept that nuclear must be at least part of the plan. What were seeing out of Congress, and to some extent out of this White House, is more accommodation for nuclear energy, Mr. Bryce said. A 2022 report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reports that France, the EUs leading atomic state with nuclear weapons and fifty-six power reactors, is poised to launch a major reinvestment in nuclear power. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland are also preparing to build new nuclear reactors, the report states, while other European nationsAustria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and Portugalremain opposed to nuclear power. California regulators, meanwhile, opted in December 2023 to keep the states nuclear facility at Diablo Canyon open through at least 2030, having previously ordered its closure in 2025. This is a retreat for a state that has been plagued with rolling blackouts as it jumped headlong into a wind and solar future.

Increasingly, however, with excess reserves dwindling as coal plants are aggressively shut down across the United States, this ability to phone a friend is going away.Following Europe and California In many ways, Texas followed the lead of Europe and California in transitioning their grid to wind and solar energy, retiring coal plants and sometimes nuclear plants as well, to halt global warming and please anti-nuclear activists. Because wind and solar are weather-dependent, a dispatchable backup source is needed, and that source is typically natural gas. As Europe, California, and Texas have learned, this transition creates vulnerability compared to coal and nuclear plants, where fuel can be stored on-site. It has also led to sharply increasing prices for electricity, as dual systems of power generation need to be built, along with additional transmission infrastructure. According to a 2021 Princeton Study, relying on wind and solar to achieve net zero by 2050 would require Americas high-voltage transmission network to triple in size, at a cost of $2.4 trillion. In what appears to be a surrender, or at least a retreat, from the net-zero transition, some European countries, like Germany, are restarting their coal plants as wind and solar fail to meet demand, even at inflated prices. What we see in Europe from this misguided infatuation with renewables is a stark warning, and I think we can see the same thing in Californiaskyrocketing electricity prices and no significant reduction in CO2 to speak of, Mr. Bryce said. At the same time, the drive to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions has led to political and corporate campaigns to shift ever more products onto the electric grid. This includes such essentials as home heating, transportation, and cooking. Laws and regulations in Europe and the United States have sought to ban or phase out oil and gas heating in homes, along with gasoline-powered cars, trucks, and buses. The effect of this will be to make people more dependent on electricity while pushing up demand to levels that many say the grid cannot meet. The grid is already cracking under existing demand, Mr. Bryce said. Were seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, while these pressure groups are trying to put yet more demand on it. This is a date with disaster.Wind and Solar Devour Open Spaces Added to this is the insatiable hunger of the wind and solar industry for the consumption of land. According to a May report by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), reaching the goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050 would consume more than 250,000 square miles, or 160 million acres, of land. With current siting practices, an area the size of Texas is required to accommodate the wind and solar infrastructure we need to reach nationwide net-zero emissions by 2050, stated Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at TNC, a renewable energy advocate. Many energy experts and environmentalists are coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is the best choice to generate reliable, affordable energy, while cutting CO2 emissions. Despite headline nuclear catastrophes at plants in Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, many countries are building new plants or delaying closures of existing nuclear plants, considering it the cleanest and least environmentally harmful source of electricity. According to a report by the Nuclear Energy Institute, wind farms require up to 360 times as much land area to produce the same amount of electricity as a nuclear energy facility, and solar facilities require up to 75 times the land area. Compared to coal and natural gas plants, wind and solar consume at least 10 times as much land, according to the left-leaning Brookings Institution. In addition to a smaller footprint, nuclear power stations also typically do not require the construction of thousands of miles of new transmission lines to reach remote locations, where wind and solar facilities are typically built. With nuclear, Mr. Bryce said, we dont need to expand the grid; we can use the grid we have.Climate Activists Embrace Nuclear Even ardent supporters of green-new-deal initiatives are starting to accept that nuclear must be at least part of the plan. What were seeing out of Congress, and to some extent out of this White House, is more accommodation for nuclear energy, Mr. Bryce said. A 2022 report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reports that France, the EUs leading atomic state with nuclear weapons and fifty-six power reactors, is poised to launch a major reinvestment in nuclear power. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland are also preparing to build new nuclear reactors, the report states, while other European nationsAustria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and Portugalremain opposed to nuclear power. California regulators, meanwhile, opted in December 2023 to keep the states nuclear facility at Diablo Canyon open through at least 2030, having previously ordered its closure in 2025. This is a retreat for a state that has been plagued with rolling blackouts as it jumped headlong into a wind and solar future. If we are going to agree that climate change is an issue, with more [weather] extremes for longer, its total insanity to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather, Mr. Bryce said. We need weather-resilient, weather-resistant generation, not weather-dependent generation. With the Inflation Reduction Act and the investment tax credits, production tax credits, all of the financial incentives in the power-gen sector are to build more wind and solar, he said.

In that short time, at least 210 deaths were attributed to the outage, which also caused an estimated $195 billion in economic damage.

To me, that is just absolute crazy town. The documentary is available to watch for free on YouTube or at juicetheseries.com. Read more at:TheEpochTimes.comThe third leg of the fatal trifecta is the ability of regions of the grid to support each other. For all its fragmented sources, utilities, and regulations, the North American power grid is interconnected in a way that allows one region to shift electricity to another region if one has an excess and the other a shortfall. Utilities routinely rely on this to balance supply and demand at any given moment. Increasingly, however, with excess reserves dwindling as coal plants are aggressively shut down across the United States, this ability to phone a friend is going away.Following Europe and California In many ways, Texas followed the lead of Europe and California in transitioning their grid to wind and solar energy, retiring coal plants and sometimes nuclear plants as well, to halt global warming and please anti-nuclear activists. Because wind and solar are weather-dependent, a dispatchable backup source is needed, and that source is typically natural gas. As Europe, California, and Texas have learned, this transition creates vulnerability compared to coal and nuclear plants, where fuel can be stored on-site. It has also led to sharply increasing prices for electricity, as dual systems of power generation need to be built, along with additional transmission infrastructure. According to a 2021 Princeton Study, relying on wind and solar to achieve net zero by 2050 would require Americas high-voltage transmission network to triple in size, at a cost of $2.4 trillion. In what appears to be a surrender, or at least a retreat, from the net-zero transition, some European countries, like Germany, are restarting their coal plants as wind and solar fail to meet demand, even at inflated prices. What we see in Europe from this misguided infatuation with renewables is a stark warning, and I think we can see the same thing in Californiaskyrocketing electricity prices and no significant reduction in CO2 to speak of, Mr. Bryce said. At the same time, the drive to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions has led to political and corporate campaigns to shift ever more products onto the electric grid. This includes such essentials as home heating, transportation, and cooking. Laws and regulations in Europe and the United States have sought to ban or phase out oil and gas heating in homes, along with gasoline-powered cars, trucks, and buses. The effect of this will be to make people more dependent on electricity while pushing up demand to levels that many say the grid cannot meet. The grid is already cracking under existing demand, Mr. Bryce said. Were seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, while these pressure groups are trying to put yet more demand on it. This is a date with disaster.Wind and Solar Devour Open Spaces Added to this is the insatiable hunger of the wind and solar industry for the consumption of land. According to a May report by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), reaching the goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050 would consume more than 250,000 square miles, or 160 million acres, of land. With current siting practices, an area the size of Texas is required to accommodate the wind and solar infrastructure we need to reach nationwide net-zero emissions by 2050, stated Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at TNC, a renewable energy advocate. Many energy experts and environmentalists are coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is the best choice to generate reliable, affordable energy, while cutting CO2 emissions. Despite headline nuclear catastrophes at plants in Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, many countries are building new plants or delaying closures of existing nuclear plants, considering it the cleanest and least environmentally harmful source of electricity. According to a report by the Nuclear Energy Institute, wind farms require up to 360 times as much land area to produce the same amount of electricity as a nuclear energy facility, and solar facilities require up to 75 times the land area. Compared to coal and natural gas plants, wind and solar consume at least 10 times as much land, according to the left-leaning Brookings Institution. In addition to a smaller footprint, nuclear power stations also typically do not require the construction of thousands of miles of new transmission lines to reach remote locations, where wind and solar facilities are typically built. With nuclear, Mr. Bryce said, we dont need to expand the grid; we can use the grid we have.Climate Activists Embrace Nuclear Even ardent supporters of green-new-deal initiatives are starting to accept that nuclear must be at least part of the plan. What were seeing out of Congress, and to some extent out of this White House, is more accommodation for nuclear energy, Mr. Bryce said. A 2022 report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reports that France, the EUs leading atomic state with nuclear weapons and fifty-six power reactors, is poised to launch a major reinvestment in nuclear power. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland are also preparing to build new nuclear reactors, the report states, while other European nationsAustria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and Portugalremain opposed to nuclear power. California regulators, meanwhile, opted in December 2023 to keep the states nuclear facility at Diablo Canyon open through at least 2030, having previously ordered its closure in 2025. This is a retreat for a state that has been plagued with rolling blackouts as it jumped headlong into a wind and solar future. If we are going to agree that climate change is an issue, with more [weather] extremes for longer, its total insanity to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather, Mr. Bryce said.

According to a May report by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), reaching the goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050 would consume more than 250,000 square miles, or 160 million acres, of land. With current siting practices, an area the size of Texas is required to accommodate the wind and solar infrastructure we need to reach nationwide net-zero emissions by 2050, stated Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at TNC, a renewable energy advocate. Many energy experts and environmentalists are coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is the best choice to generate reliable, affordable energy, while cutting CO2 emissions. Despite headline nuclear catastrophes at plants in Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, many countries are building new plants or delaying closures of existing nuclear plants, considering it the cleanest and least environmentally harmful source of electricity. According to a report by the Nuclear Energy Institute, wind farms require up to 360 times as much land area to produce the same amount of electricity as a nuclear energy facility, and solar facilities require up to 75 times the land area. Compared to coal and natural gas plants, wind and solar consume at least 10 times as much land, according to the left-leaning Brookings Institution. In addition to a smaller footprint, nuclear power stations also typically do not require the construction of thousands of miles of new transmission lines to reach remote locations, where wind and solar facilities are typically built. With nuclear, Mr. Bryce said, we dont need to expand the grid; we can use the grid we have.Climate Activists Embrace Nuclear Even ardent supporters of green-new-deal initiatives are starting to accept that nuclear must be at least part of the plan. What were seeing out of Congress, and to some extent out of this White House, is more accommodation for nuclear energy, Mr. Bryce said. A 2022 report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reports that France, the EUs leading atomic state with nuclear weapons and fifty-six power reactors, is poised to launch a major reinvestment in nuclear power. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland are also preparing to build new nuclear reactors, the report states, while other European nationsAustria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and Portugalremain opposed to nuclear power. California regulators, meanwhile, opted in December 2023 to keep the states nuclear facility at Diablo Canyon open through at least 2030, having previously ordered its closure in 2025. This is a retreat for a state that has been plagued with rolling blackouts as it jumped headlong into a wind and solar future. If we are going to agree that climate change is an issue, with more [weather] extremes for longer, its total insanity to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather, Mr. Bryce said. We need weather-resilient, weather-resistant generation, not weather-dependent generation. With the Inflation Reduction Act and the investment tax credits, production tax credits, all of the financial incentives in the power-gen sector are to build more wind and solar, he said.

Read more at:TheEpochTimes.comAs Europe, California, and Texas have learned, this transition creates vulnerability compared to coal and nuclear plants, where fuel can be stored on-site. It has also led to sharply increasing prices for electricity, as dual systems of power generation need to be built, along with additional transmission infrastructure. According to a 2021 Princeton Study, relying on wind and solar to achieve net zero by 2050 would require Americas high-voltage transmission network to triple in size, at a cost of $2.4 trillion. In what appears to be a surrender, or at least a retreat, from the net-zero transition, some European countries, like Germany, are restarting their coal plants as wind and solar fail to meet demand, even at inflated prices. What we see in Europe from this misguided infatuation with renewables is a stark warning, and I think we can see the same thing in Californiaskyrocketing electricity prices and no significant reduction in CO2 to speak of, Mr. Bryce said. At the same time, the drive to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions has led to political and corporate campaigns to shift ever more products onto the electric grid. This includes such essentials as home heating, transportation, and cooking. Laws and regulations in Europe and the United States have sought to ban or phase out oil and gas heating in homes, along with gasoline-powered cars, trucks, and buses. The effect of this will be to make people more dependent on electricity while pushing up demand to levels that many say the grid cannot meet.

Read more at:TheEpochTimes.comWhat we see in Europe from this misguided infatuation with renewables is a stark warning, and I think we can see the same thing in Californiaskyrocketing electricity prices and no significant reduction in CO2 to speak of, Mr. Bryce said. At the same time, the drive to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions has led to political and corporate campaigns to shift ever more products onto the electric grid. This includes such essentials as home heating, transportation, and cooking. Laws and regulations in Europe and the United States have sought to ban or phase out oil and gas heating in homes, along with gasoline-powered cars, trucks, and buses. The effect of this will be to make people more dependent on electricity while pushing up demand to levels that many say the grid cannot meet. The grid is already cracking under existing demand, Mr. Bryce said. Were seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, while these pressure groups are trying to put yet more demand on it. This is a date with disaster.Wind and Solar Devour Open Spaces Added to this is the insatiable hunger of the wind and solar industry for the consumption of land. According to a May report by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), reaching the goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050 would consume more than 250,000 square miles, or 160 million acres, of land. With current siting practices, an area the size of Texas is required to accommodate the wind and solar infrastructure we need to reach nationwide net-zero emissions by 2050, stated Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at TNC, a renewable energy advocate. Many energy experts and environmentalists are coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is the best choice to generate reliable, affordable energy, while cutting CO2 emissions. Despite headline nuclear catastrophes at plants in Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, many countries are building new plants or delaying closures of existing nuclear plants, considering it the cleanest and least environmentally harmful source of electricity. According to a report by the Nuclear Energy Institute, wind farms require up to 360 times as much land area to produce the same amount of electricity as a nuclear energy facility, and solar facilities require up to 75 times the land area. Compared to coal and natural gas plants, wind and solar consume at least 10 times as much land, according to the left-leaning Brookings Institution. In addition to a smaller footprint, nuclear power stations also typically do not require the construction of thousands of miles of new transmission lines to reach remote locations, where wind and solar facilities are typically built. With nuclear, Mr. Bryce said, we dont need to expand the grid; we can use the grid we have.Climate Activists Embrace Nuclear Even ardent supporters of green-new-deal initiatives are starting to accept that nuclear must be at least part of the plan. What were seeing out of Congress, and to some extent out of this White House, is more accommodation for nuclear energy, Mr. Bryce said. A 2022 report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reports that France, the EUs leading atomic state with nuclear weapons and fifty-six power reactors, is poised to launch a major reinvestment in nuclear power. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland are also preparing to build new nuclear reactors, the report states, while other European nationsAustria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and Portugalremain opposed to nuclear power. California regulators, meanwhile, opted in December 2023 to keep the states nuclear facility at Diablo Canyon open through at least 2030, having previously ordered its closure in 2025. This is a retreat for a state that has been plagued with rolling blackouts as it jumped headlong into a wind and solar future. If we are going to agree that climate change is an issue, with more [weather] extremes for longer, its total insanity to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather, Mr. Bryce said. We need weather-resilient, weather-resistant generation, not weather-dependent generation.

Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland are also preparing to build new nuclear reactors, the report states, while other European nationsAustria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and Portugalremain opposed to nuclear power. California regulators, meanwhile, opted in December 2023 to keep the states nuclear facility at Diablo Canyon open through at least 2030, having previously ordered its closure in 2025. This is a retreat for a state that has been plagued with rolling blackouts as it jumped headlong into a wind and solar future. If we are going to agree that climate change is an issue, with more [weather] extremes for longer, its total insanity to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather, Mr. Bryce said. We need weather-resilient, weather-resistant generation, not weather-dependent generation. With the Inflation Reduction Act and the investment tax credits, production tax credits, all of the financial incentives in the power-gen sector are to build more wind and solar, he said. To me, that is just absolute crazy town. The documentary is available to watch for free on YouTube or at juicetheseries.com.

According to a May report by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), reaching the goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050 would consume more than 250,000 square miles, or 160 million acres, of land. With current siting practices, an area the size of Texas is required to accommodate the wind and solar infrastructure we need to reach nationwide net-zero emissions by 2050, stated Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at TNC, a renewable energy advocate. Many energy experts and environmentalists are coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is the best choice to generate reliable, affordable energy, while cutting CO2 emissions. Despite headline nuclear catastrophes at plants in Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, many countries are building new plants or delaying closures of existing nuclear plants, considering it the cleanest and least environmentally harmful source of electricity. According to a report by the Nuclear Energy Institute, wind farms require up to 360 times as much land area to produce the same amount of electricity as a nuclear energy facility, and solar facilities require up to 75 times the land area. Compared to coal and natural gas plants, wind and solar consume at least 10 times as much land, according to the left-leaning Brookings Institution. In addition to a smaller footprint, nuclear power stations also typically do not require the construction of thousands of miles of new transmission lines to reach remote locations, where wind and solar facilities are typically built. With nuclear, Mr. Bryce said, we dont need to expand the grid; we can use the grid we have.Climate Activists Embrace Nuclear Even ardent supporters of green-new-deal initiatives are starting to accept that nuclear must be at least part of the plan.

A 2022 report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reports that France, the EUs leading atomic state with nuclear weapons and fifty-six power reactors, is poised to launch a major reinvestment in nuclear power. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland are also preparing to build new nuclear reactors, the report states, while other European nationsAustria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and Portugalremain opposed to nuclear power. California regulators, meanwhile, opted in December 2023 to keep the states nuclear facility at Diablo Canyon open through at least 2030, having previously ordered its closure in 2025. This is a retreat for a state that has been plagued with rolling blackouts as it jumped headlong into a wind and solar future. If we are going to agree that climate change is an issue, with more [weather] extremes for longer, its total insanity to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather, Mr. Bryce said. We need weather-resilient, weather-resistant generation, not weather-dependent generation. With the Inflation Reduction Act and the investment tax credits, production tax credits, all of the financial incentives in the power-gen sector are to build more wind and solar, he said.

Its been close to 40 years since more than 100,000 people were evacuated from the area surrounding Chernobyl, and while that region is still considered inhospitable to human beings, the wolves that call it home have apparently developed a very intriguing trait.As you likely know, the meltdown that struck Chernobyl in 1986 is considered the worst incident in the history of nuclear energy due to the ramifications that couldve been much, much worse if the Soviets hadnt scrambled to address the deadly threats that stemmed from their own bureaucratic incompetence.The official death toll for the disaster sits at 30 due to people who perished after being exposed to lethal levels of radiation, although it is believed thousands more have or will eventually pass away from cancer that can be traced back to the fallout of what unfolded at the power plant.Ukraine is still home to a 1,000-square-mile area known as the Exclusion Zone that humans will be unable to inhabit for at least 3,000 years, and while there was a mass culling of animals in the region following the disaster, plenty of wildlife eventually made its way back into the impacted woodlands.That includes the mutant wolves that have attracted the interest of scientists whove spent decades conducting Chernobyl-adjacent researchincluding Cara Love, an evolutionary biologist at Princeton who was part of a team that managed to affix collars to the animals in 2014 to measure the levels of radiation theyre exposed to.According to Sky News, the data shows the wolves are subjected to 11.28 millirem of radiation on a daily basis, which the outlet notes is six times the level that is deemed safe for humans. You might assume that would result in a proliferation of cancer in the population, but it appears the animals have adapted to their hostile environment.Love said her research shows the wolves have not only developed altered immune systems similar to cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment but that blood tests she and her team have run have detected genetic mutations that appear to reduce the risk of cancer.Theres hope that theyll be able to use the evidence theyve obtained to further work concerning cancer prevention and treatment in humans, so its good to hear something positive could possibly come out of an otherwise disastrous situation.
The Council of EU member states and the European Parliament agreed on Tuesday (6 February) to label nuclear power as a strategic technology for the EUs decarbonisation, following months of intense negotiations in Brussels over the Net-Zero Industry Act (NZIA).It came in response to the massive US green subsidy programme, the Inflation Reduction Act, as well as long-standing Chinese efforts to become global leaders in the manufacturing of clean technologies like batteries, heat pumps and solar panels.To this end, the NZIA aims to accelerate permitting procedures for industrial production sites involved in the manufacturing of components needed for renewable energy technologies, but also for nuclear power.Meeting in trilogues, negotiators from the Parliament, the Council, and the European Commission confirmed on Tuesday the strategic nature of projects relating to nuclear energy, which are included in a single list of net-zero technologies that will benefit from the NZIA.The text is a mix of the two mandates [adopted by the Council and Parliament], with a more comprehensive list than what was proposed by the member states, explained French MEP Christophe Grudler who took part in the talks for the centrist Renew Europe group in Parliament.The agreement encompasses tried and tested nuclear technologies as well as future third and fourth generation ones, i.e. small modular reactors (SMRs) and advanced nuclear reactors (AMRs). Their fuel cycles are also included in the text.While supporters of nuclear power in France have welcomed plans to scrap the two-tier approach to low-carbon technologies in the EUs draft Net-Zero Industry Act (NZIA), they also condemn the lower status granted to atomic energy as incoherent with the blocs wider decarbonisation goals.Concretely, this means that factories producing components for these technologies will benefit from simplified permitting procedures, with deadlines ranging from 18 to 12 months for bigger projects and 12 to nine months for smaller ones.The situation caused uproar among advocates of nuclear power after European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen publicly insisted that nuclear power was not strategic. In Paris, these were dismissed as unfortunate comments.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen outlined limits to EU backing for nuclear power under the blocs Net-Zero Industry Act, which seeks to support home-made production of clean technologies like batteries and solar panels.After much back and forth, nuclear power was finally included in the single list of 17 technologies proposed in November by the texts rapporteur, German MEP Christian Ehler (European Peoples Party  EPP).

The public continues to vote in politicians that support highly centralized energy systems, and apparently are willing to pay for those systems, whose costs increasingly rise. Nuclear power costs are too often hidden and/or fudged; the externalities of nuke power and burning huge amounts of fossil fuels are rarely revealed by those in power. Find ways to assist individual property owners to make their properties more energy efficient, and find ways to generate electricity that are renewable and do as little harm to the environment as possible.

The 4-meter high sea wall for example subsided and tilted under repeated 3-meter tsunami hits, and not far away tsunami waves are shown to have reached higher than that.That is 100% not true. Communities with nuclear power plants receive contributions from the power companies which are supposed to be used for various matters like evacuations. It is also used to improve the community.


This cancer diagnosis led to a Shakespearean tragedy that not only brought about the end of the Iranian monarchy, but also directly led to the situation we are in today, where Iran has, for 45 years, been the arch-enemy of America.Since the Iran-backed group Hamas attacked Israel in October, both Israel and the United States have been striking other Iran-backed militant groups around the region, in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen.

Some high points have come in 2007, 2015, 2017, and 2024. Each time it has been absolutely critical to attack Iran at once. There could be no delay. Dominoes would fall. Terrorism would prevail. Credibility would be sqandered. And yet, each time, the threatened war has not been launched, and the world has gone on just the same.Weve seen a wide variety of excuses deployed over these years of unsuccessful propaganda for a war on Iran, including false claims about nuclear weapons, the pretense that attacking Iran would improve civil liberties within Iran, and shockingly honest commitments to gaining control of more oil with which to slowly destroy the habitability of the Earth. The push to attack Iran has been on for so long that entire categories of arguments for it (such as that the Iranians are fueling the Iraqi resistance) and demonized leaders of Iran have come and gone. The latest excuse is the killing of three members of the U.S. military.Ordinarily, killing people could be prosecuted as a crime. But thats tricky, because the United States government opposes and refuses to take part in international law, the U.S. troops had no legal justification for being where they were, and the violence across the region is being driven by U.S. support for enormous crimes by the Israeli government.More importantly, the advocates for war do not want to prosecute a crime, but to use a crime as an excuse to commit much larger crimes, on the familiar model of September 11, October 7, etc. The choice to escalate is not imposed on anyone; similar situations in the past have been used as excuses for war and also allowed to pass without the launching of any war.The U.S. government purports to believe that escalating wars will reduce wars, flying in the face of the overwhelming evidence of centuries, and to believe that there is no alternative, even though the demands of all sorts of warmakers across Western Asia are all the same and extremely easy to satisfy (and satisfying them has been ordered by the International Court of Justice): stop destroying Gaza and killing Gazans.The U.S. government distorts the notion of defense beyond all recognition by claiming that harm done to its imperial troops anywhere on Earth can justify a defensive war. This is highly convenient for war hawks in Washington, D.C., who have known for many years that getting U.S. troops killed can be a big propaganda boost for war madness  an idea eagerly encouraged today by U.S. media outlets that are always perfectly capable of demanding revenge while simulaneously calling it defense.This is what the empire of U.S. military bases looks like to Iran. Try to imagine if you lived there, what you would think of this. Who is threatening whom? Who is the greater danger to whom? The point is not that Iran should be free to attack the United States or anyone else because its military is smaller. The point is that doing so would be national suicide. It would also be something Iran has not done for centuries. But it would be typical U.S. behavior.The U.S. overthrew Irans democracy in 1953 and installed a brutal dictator / weapons customer. The U.S. gave Iran nuclear energy technology in the 1970s. Following the Iranian revolution, the United States aided Iraq in the 1980s in attacking Iran, providing Iraq with some of the weapons (including chemical weapons) that were used on Iranians and that would be used in 2002-2003 (when they no longer existed) as an excuse for attacking Iraq.The roots of a Washington push for a new war on Iran can be found in the 1992 Defense Planning Guidance, the 1996 paper called A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm, the 2000 Rebuilding Americas Defenses, and in a 2001 Pentagon memo described by Wesley Clark as listing these nations for attack: Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Lebanon, Syria, and Iran. Its worth noting that Bush Jr. overthrew Iraq, and Obama Libya, while the others remain works in progress. The arguments in these old forgotten memos were not what the war makers tell the public, but much closer to what they tell each other. The concerns were those of dominating regions rich in resources, intimidating others, and establishing bases from which to maintain control of puppet governments.In 2000, the CIA gave Iran nuclear bomb plans in an effort to frame it. This was reported by James Risen, and Jeffrey Sterling went to prison for allegedly being Risens source. But nobody involved in the scheme was ever punished in any way.In 2010, Tony Blair included Iran on a list of countries that he said Dick Cheney had aimed to overthrow. The line among the powerful in Washington in 2003 was that Iraq would be a cakewalk but that real men go to Tehran.For many years, the United States has labeled Iran an evil nation, attacked and destroyed the other non-nuclear nation on the list of evil nations, designated part of Irans military a terrorist organization, falsely accused Iran of crimes including the attacks of 9-11, murdered Iranian scientists, funded opposition groups in Iran (including some the U.S. also designates as terrorist), flew dronesover Iran, openly and illegally threatened to attack Iran, and built up military forces all around Irans borders, while imposing cruel sanctions on the country. The long history of the United States lying about Iranian nuclear weapons is chronicled by Gareth Porters book Manufactured Crisis.In 2007, we were told that Iran needed to be attacked urgently due to false claims about nuclear weapons. Even a National Intelligence Estimate in 2007 pushed back and admitted that Iran had no nuclear weapons program.In 2015, Republicans urged war justified by Irans nuclear weapons program, while Democrats successfully moved for passage of an agreement with Iran, also justified by Irans nuclear weapons program. The agreement was not a treaty, and President Trump would later throw it out. But the damage of both sides falsely claiming that Iran had a nuclear weapons program was done.Dick and Liz Cheneys book, Exceptional, tell us we must see a moral difference between an Iranian nuclear weapon and an American one. Must we, really? Either risks further proliferation, accidental use, use by a crazed leader, mass death and destruction, environmental disaster, retaliatory escalation, and apocalypse. One of those two nations has nuclear weapons, has used nuclear weapons, has provided the other with plans for nuclear weapons, has a policy of first-use of nuclear weapons, has leadership that sanctions the possession of nuclear weapons, and has frequently threated to use nuclear weapons. I dont think those facts would make a nuclear weapon in the hands of the other country the least bit moral, but also not the least bit more immoral. Lets focus on seeing an empiricaldifference between an Iranian nuclear weapon and an American one. One exists. The other doesnt.If youre wondering, U.S. presidents who have made specific public or secret nuclear threats to other nations, that we know of, as documented in Daniel Ellsbergs The Doomsday Machine, have included Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump, while others, including Barack Obama and Donald Trump have frequently said things like All options are on the table in relation to Iran or another country.Proponents of war or steps toward war (sanctions was a step toward the war on Iraq) say we urgently need a war on Iran now, but they have no argument for urgency, and theyve been making the same argument with ever less credibility for years.The Trump White House early on openly expressed a desire to claim that Iran had violated the 2015 nuclear agreement, but produced no evidence. It didnt matter. Trump tore up the agreement anyway and used his own shredding of the agreement as grounds for nuclear fearmongering about Iran.In 2017, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations claimed that Iranian weapons had been used in a war that the U.S.., Saudi Arabia, and allies were illegally and disastrously waging in Yemen. While thats a problem that should be corrected, it is hard to find a war anywhere on the planet without U.S. weapons in it. In fact, a report that made news the same day as the ambassadors claims, pointed to the long-known fact that many of the weapons used by ISIS had once belonged to the United States, many of them having been given by the U.S. to non-state fighters (aka terrorists) in Syria.Fighting wars and arming others to fight wars/terrorism is a justification for indictment and prosecution, but not for war, legally, morally, or practically. The United States fights and arms wars, and no one would be justified in attacking the United States.If Iran is guilty of a crime, and there is evidence to support that claim, the United States and the world should seek its prosecution. Instead, the United States is isolating itself by tearing down the rule of law.President Biden came into office with the possibility wide open to restore the Iran agreement and pursue a better course. He chose not to do so, and not to even try to do so. He waited for a less amendable government to take power in Iran, and then did seemingly everything he could to stir up hostitlities in the region. Now an agreement looks much more difficult to obtain.Of course the reason why real men go to Tehran is that Iran is not the impoverished disarmed nation that one might find in, say, Afghanistan or Iraq, or even the disarmed nation found in Libya in 2011. Iran is much bigger and much better armed. Whether the United States launches a major assault on Iran or Israel does, Iran will retaliate against U.S. troops and probably Israel and possibly the United States itself as well. And the United States will without any doubt re-retaliate for that. Iran cannot be unaware that the U.S. governments pressure on the Israeli government not to attack Iran consists of reassuring the Israelis that the United States will attack when needed, and does not include even threatening to stop funding Israels military or to stop vetoing measures of accountability for Israeli crimes at the United Nations.Of course, many in the U.S. government and military oppose attacking Iran, although key figures like Admiral William Fallon have been moved out of the way. Much of the Israeli military is opposed as well, not to mention the Israeli and U.S. people. But war is not clean or precise. If the people we allow to run our nations attack another, we are all put at risk.Most at risk, of course, are the people of Iran, people as peaceful as any other, or perhaps more so. As in any country, no matter what its government, the people of Iran are fundamentally good, decent, peaceful, just, and fundamentally like you and me. Ive met people from Iran. You may have met people from Iran. They look like this. Theyre not a different species. Theyre not evil. A surgical strike against a facility in their country would cause a great many of them to die very painful and horrible deaths. Even if you imagine that Iran would not retaliate for such attacks, this is what the attacks would in themselves consist of: mass murder.And what would that accomplish? It would unite the people of Iran and much of the world against the United States. It would justify in the eyes of much of the world an underground Iranian program to develop nuclear weapons, a program that probably does not exist at present, except to the extent that legal nuclear energy programs move a country closer to weapons development. The environmental damage would be tremendous, the precedent set incredibly dangerous, all talk of cutting the U.S. military budget would be buried in a wave of war frenzy, civil liberties and representative government would be flushed down the Potomac, a nuclear arms race would spread to additional countries, and any momentary sadistic glee would be outweighed by accelerating home foreclosures, mounting student debt, and accumulating layers of cultural stupidity.Strategically, legally, and morally weapons possession is not grounds for war, and neither is pursuit of weapons possession. And neither, I might add, with Iraq in mind, is theoretically possible pursuit of weapons never acted upon. Israel has nuclear weapons. The United States has more nuclear weapons than any other country but Russia (the two of them together have 90% of the worlds nukes). There can be no justification for attacking the United States, Israel, or any other country. The pretense that Iran has or will soon have nuclear weapons is, in any case, just a pretense, one that has been revived, debunked, and revived again like a zombie for years and years. But thats not the really absurd part of this false claim for something that amounts to no justification for war whatsoever.The really absurd part is that it was the United States in 1976 that pushed nuclear energy on Iran. In 2000 the CIA gave the Iranian government (slightly flawed) plans to build a nuclear bomb. In 2003, Iran proposed negotiations with the United States with everything on the table, including its nuclear technology, and the United States refused. Shortly thereafter, the United States started angling for a war. Meanwhile, U.S.-led sanctions prevent Iran from developing wind energy, while the Koch brothers are allowed to trade with Iran without penalty.Another area of ongoing lie debunking, one that almost exactly parallels the buildup to the 2003 attack on Iraq, is the relentless false claim, including by candidates in 2012 for U.S. President, that Iran has not allowed inspectors into its country or given them access to its sites. Iran had, in fact, prior to the agreement voluntarily accepted stricter standards than the IAEA requires. And of course a separate line of propaganda, albeit a contradictory one, holds that the IAEA has discovered a nuclear weapons program in Iran. Under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), Iran was not required to declare all of its installations, and early last decade it chose not to, as the United States violated that same treaty by blocking Germany, China, and others from providing nuclear energy equipment to Iran. While Iran remains in compliance with the NPT, India and Pakistan and Israel have not signed it and North Korea has withdrawn from it, while the United States and other nuclear powers continuously violate it by failing to reduce arms, by providing arms to other countries such as India, and by developing new nuclear weapons, not to mention keeping nuclear weapons in six European countries, providing Russia to put them into one European country as well.Are you ready for an even more absurd twist? This is on the same scale as Bushs comment about not really giving much thought to Osama bin Laden. Are you ready? The proponents of attacking Iran themselves admit that if Iran had nukes it would not use them. This is from the American Enterprise Institute:The biggest problem for the United States is not Iran getting a nuclear weapon and testing it, its Iran getting a nuclear weapon and not using it. Because the second that they have one and they dont do anything bad, all of the naysayers are going to come back and say, See, we told you Iran is a responsible power. We told you Iran wasnt getting nuclear weapons in order to use them immediately.  And they will eventually define Iran with nuclear weapons as not a problem.Is that clear? Iran using a nuclear weapon would be bad: environmental damage, loss of human life, hideous pain and suffering, yada, yada, yada. But what would be really bad would be Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon and doing what every other nation with them has done since Nagasaki: nothing. That would be really bad because it would damage an argument for war and make war more difficult, thus allowing Iran to run its country as it, rather than the United States, sees fit. Of course it might run it very badly (although the U.S. is hardly establishing a model for the world over here either), but it would run it without U.S. approval, and that would be worse than nuclear destruction.Inspections were allowed in Iraq and they worked. They found no weapons and there were no weapons. Inspections have been allowed in Iran and have worked. However, the IAEA has come under the corrupting influence of the U.S. government. And yet, the bluster from war proponents about IAEA claims over the years is not backed up by any actual claims from the IAEA. And what little material the IAEA has provided for the cause of war has been widely rejected when not being laughed at.Another year, another lie. No longer do we hear that North Korea is helping Iran build nukes. Lies about Iranian backing of Iraqi resisters have faded. (Didnt the United States back French resistance to Germans at one point?) Another recent concoction is the Iran did 911 lie. Revenge, like the rest of these attempted grounds for war, is actually not a legal or moral justification for war. But the 9/11 fiction has already been put to rest by the indespensable Gareth Porter, among others. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, which did play a role in 911 as well as in the Iraqi resistance, is being sold record quantities of that good old leading U.S. export of which were all so proud: weapons of mass destruction.Oh, I almost forgot another lie that hasnt quite entirely faded yet. Iran did not try to blow up a Saudi ambassador in Washington, D.C., an action which President Obama would have considered perfectly praiseworthy if the roles were reversed, but a lie that even Fox News had a hard time stomaching. And thats saying something.And then theres that old standby: Ahmadinejad said Israel should be wiped off the map. While this does not, perhaps, rise to the level of John McCain singing about bombing Iran or Bush and Obama swearing that all options including nuclear attack are on the table, it sounds extremely disturbing: wiped off the map! However, the translation is a bad one. A more accurate translation was the regime occupying Jerusalem must vanish from the page of time. The government of Israel, not the nation of Israel. Not even the government of Israel, but the current regime. Hell, Americans say that about their own regimes all the time, alternating every four to eight years depending on political party (some of us even say it all the time, without immunity for either party). Iran has made clear it would approve of a two-state solution if Palestinians approved of it. If the U.S. launched missile strikes every time somebody said something stupid, even if accurately translated, how safe would it be to live near Newt Gingrichs or Joe Bidens house?Luckily, war resisters have succeeded for so long (even while telling each other that they never succeed) that the war mongers dont remember who Ahmadinejad even was anymore, and all that demonization has gone to nought.The real danger may not actually be the lies. The Iraq experience has built up quite a mental resistance to these sorts of lies in many U.S. residents. The real danger may be the slow start of a war that gains momentum on its own without any formal announcement of its initiation. Israel and the United States have not just been talking tough or crazy. Theyve been murdering Iranians. And they seem to have no shame about it. The day after a Republican presidential primary debate at which candidates declared their desire to kill Iranians, the CIA apparently made certain the news was public that it was in fact already murdering Iranians, not to mention blowing up buildings. Some would say and have said that the war has already begun. Those who cannot see this because they do not want to see it will also miss the deadly humor in the United States asking Iran to return its brave drone.There was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war. The one that interested me the most was why dont we build  we in our shipyard  build four or five boats that look like Iranian PT boats. Put Navy seals on them with a lot of arms. And next time one of our boats goes to the Straits of Hormuz, start a shoot-up. Might cost some lives. And it was rejected because you cant have Americans killing Americans. Thats the kind of  thats the level of stuff were talking about. Provocation. But that was rejected.Now, Dick Cheney is not your typical American. Nobody in the U.S. government is your typical American. Your typical American is struggling, disapproves of the U.S. government, wishes billionaires were taxed, favors green energy and education and jobs over military boondoggles, thinks corporations should be barred from buying elections, and would not be inclined to apologize for getting shot in the face by the Vice President.Back in the 1930s, the Ludlow Amendment nearly made it a Constitutional requirement that the public vote in a referendum before the United States could go to war. President Franklin Roosevelt blocked that proposal. Yet the Constitution already required and still requires that Congress declare war before a war is fought. That has not been done in almost 80 years, while wars have raged on almost incessantly. In the past decade and right up through President Obamas signing of the outrageous National Defense Authorization Act on New Years Eve 2011-2012, the power to make war has been handed over to presidents. Here is one more reason to oppose a presidential war on Iran: once you allow presidents to make wars, you will never stop them. Another reason, in so far as anybody any longer gives a damn, is that war is a crime. Iran and the United States are parties to the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which bans war. One of those two nations is not complying.But we wont have a referendum. The U.S. House of Misrepresentatives wont step in. Only through widespread public pressure and nonviolent action will we intervene in this slow-motion catastrophe. This war, if it happens, will be fought by an institution called the United States Department of Defense, but it will endanger rather than defending us. As the war progresses, we will be told that the Iranian people want to be bombed for their own good, for freedom, for democracy. But nobody wants to be bombed for that. Iran does not want U.S.-style democracy. Even the United States does not want U.S.-style democracy. We will be told that those noble goals are guiding the actions of our brave troops and our brave drones on the battlefield. Yet there will be no battlefield. There will be no front lines. There will be no trenches. There will simply be cities and towns where people live, and where people die. There will be no victory. There will be no progress accomplished through a surge. On January 5, 2012, then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta was asked at a press conference about the failures in Iraq and Afghanistan, and he replied simply that those were successes. That is the kind of success that could be expected in Iran were Iran a destitute and disarmed state.Now we begin to understand the importance of all the media suppression, blackouts, and lies about the damage done to Iraq and Afghanistan. Now we understand why Obama and Panetta embraced the lies that launched the War on Iraq. The same lies must now be revived, as for every war ever fought, for a War on Iran. Heres a video explaining how this will work, even with some new twistsand lots of variations. The U.S. corporate media is part of the war machine.Planning war and funding war creates its own momentum. Sanctions become, as with Iraq, a stepping stone to war. Cutting off diplomacy leaves few options open. Electoral pissing contests take us allwhere most of us did not want to be.These are the bombs most likely to launch this ugly and quite possibly terminal chapter of human history. This animation shows clearly what they would do. For an even better presentation, pair that with this audio of a misinformed caller trying hopelessly to persuade George Galloway that we should attack Iran.On January 2, 2012, the New York Times reported concern that cuts to the U.S. military budget raised doubts as to whether the United States would be prepared for a grinding, lengthy ground war in Asia. At a Pentagon press conference on January 5, 2012, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff reassured the press corpse (sic) that major ground wars were very much an option and that wars of one sort or another were a certainty. President Obamas statement of military policy released at that press conference listed the missions of the U.S. military. First was fighting terrorism, next detering aggression, then projecting power despite anti-access/area denial challenges, then the good old WMDs, then conquering space and cyberspace, then nuclear weapons, and finally  after all that  there was mention of defending the Homeland Formerly Known As The United States.The cases of Iraq and Iran are not identical in every detail, of course. But in both cases we are dealing with concerted efforts to get us into wars, wars based, as all wars are based, on lies. We may need to revive this appeal to U.S. and Israeli forces!Disclaimer: The contents of this article are of sole responsibility of the author(s).

Type One Energy Groupintends to locate to the Tennessee Valley Authoritys (TVA) Bull Run Fossil Plant in Clinton, TN, as the site for building Infinity One, the companys stellarator fusion prototype machine.Infinity One will allow Type One Energy to verify important design features of its high field stellarator fusion pilot plant, particularly those related to operating efficiency, reliability, maintainability, and affordability.Project Infinity, which includes the deployment of Infinity One and Type One Energys new headquarters in Tennessee, is expected to bolster economic growth and energy technological leadership in the region. Type One Energy will establish its headquarters in East Tennessee, creating over 300 high-paying jobs within the next five years.Type One EnergyCEO Christofer Mowrysaid in a press statement, Type One Energy is committed to making commercial fusion a reality over the next decade. Successful deployment of Infinity One in East Tennessee, with our partners TVA and ORNL, is a critical milestone in our FusionDirect commercialization program. It is also a watershed moment toward the commercialization of fusion, linking for the first time leaders in the technology, utility, and national laboratory sectors on an actual deployment project.TVA President and CEO Jeff Lyash said in a press statement, We appreciate this partnership between Type One Energy, ORNL, our local power companies and elected and economic development officials as we work together to identify energy technologies for the future.Oak Ridge National Laboratory Director Stephen Streiffer said in the same press statement, Its exciting to see a project in Oak Ridge with such great potential to advance fusion energy. We look forward to applying our institutional expertise and capabilities in working with Type One Energy on the engineering challenges they will be tackling at this new test facility.Type One was selected to participate in DOEs Milestone Based Fusion Development Program to develop fusion pilot plant designs and resolve related scientific and technological challenges within five to 10 years. The DOE announced awards totaling $46 million for an initial 18 months of work on May 31, 2023.ARPA-Es description of Type Ones recent Breakthroughs Enabling Thermonuclear-Fusion Energy (BETHE) project notes; Stellarators have been expensive and time consuming to build. Their large and complex electromagnets need to be shaped, supported, and positioned with precision. Type One says in its website it has planned a path to commercialization it calls the FusionDirect technology program. The next step is Starblazer which is a high-field, turbulence-optimized stellarator the company is developing as a commercial fusion pilot plant design.In parallel with Starblazer, Type One reports it will develop a risk-reduction platform over the next several years as a testbed to validate pilot plant engineering design choices and confirm its stellarator plasma physics models and simulations.On March 29, 2023, Type One Energy announced the closure of an over-subscribed seed funding round of $29M. This move marked the beginning of the firms FusionDirect program, which it says is devised to fast-track fusion energy generation in the short-term.According to the US Department of Energy,Stellarators have several advantagesover tokamaks, the other main technology that scientists are exploring for fusion power. Stellarators require less injected power to sustain the plasma, have greater design flexibility, and allow for simplification of some aspects of plasma control. However, DOE notes that these benefits come at the cost of increased complexity, especially for the magnetic field coils.Because confinement of the plasma in a stellarator is driven solely by the external magnets, modifying the shape and strength of their fields has a major impact on performance. To tailor a three-dimensional magnetic field with the right shape to achieve quasi-symmetry requires extensive calculations. Advances in computer modeling code and high-performance computing has provided this capability.The stellarator concept was invented by Lyman Spitzer at Princeton University in 1951. Much of the early development of stellarators in the 1950s occurred at a laboratory that is now DOEs Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory.Stellarators use external coils to generate a twisting magnetic field to control the plasma instead of inducing electric currents inside the plasma like a tokamak. Making stellarator coils is a challenge because it requires manufacturers to construct large bore wire coils with millimeter precision.(NucNet) A team from Princeton University has worked out a way to use an AI model to predict and prevent instabilities with plasma during fusion reactions. The researchers demonstrated their model could forecast potential plasma instabilities known as tearing mode instabilities up to 300 milliseconds in advance.Image: US Department of Energy Supercomputer simulation of plasma turbulencein a spherical tokamak.  Image courtesy of Walter Guttenfelder, Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and  Filippo Scotti, Lawrence Livermore National LaboratoryWhile 300 milliseconds leaves no more than enough time for a slow blink in humans, it was plenty of time for the AI controller to change certain operating parameters to avoid what would have developed into a tear within the plasmas magnetic field lines, upsetting its equilibrium and opening the door for a reaction-ending escape.The team said the research opens the door for more dynamic control of a fusion reaction than current approaches, and it provides a foundation for using artificial intelligence to solve a broad range of plasma instabilities, which have long been obstacles to achieving a sustained fusion reaction. The team published their findings inNatureon February 21, 2024.(Abstract summary below)Previous studies have generally focused on either suppressing or mitigating the effects of these tearing instabilities after they occur in the plasma, said first authorJaemin Seo, an assistant professor of physics at Chung-Ang University in South Korea who performed much of the work while a postdoctoral researcher in Kolemens group. But our approach allows us to predict and avoid those instabilities before they ever appear.  Avoiding Fusion Plasma Tearing Instability with Deep Reinforcement Learning  NatureNature Abstract (summary) For stable and efficient fusion energy production using a tokamak reactor, it is essential to maintain a high-pressure hydrogenic plasma without plasma disruption. Therefore, it is necessary to actively control the tokamak based on the observed plasma state, to maneuver high-pressure plasma while avoiding tearing instability, the leading cause of disruptions.This presents an obstacle-avoidance problem for which artificial intelligence based on reinforcement learning has recently shown remarkable performance1,2,3,4. However, the obstacle here, the tearing instability, is difficult to forecast and is highly prone to terminating plasma operations, especially in the ITER baseline scenario.Previously, we developed a multimodal dynamic model that estimates the likelihood of future tearing instability based on signals from multiple diagnostics and actuators. Here we harness this dynamic model as a training environment for reinforcement-learning artificial intelligence, facilitating automated instability prevention.We demonstrate artificial intelligence control to lower the possibility of disruptive tearing instabilities in DIII-D6, the largest magnetic fusion facility in the United States. The controller maintained the tearing likelihood under a given threshold, even under relatively unfavorable conditions of low safety factor and low torque.In particular, it allowed the plasma to actively track the stable path within the time-varying operational space while maintaining H-mode performance, which was challenging with traditional preprogrammed control. This controller paves the path to developing stable high-performance operational scenarios for future use in ITER.(News Release) The IAEA has designated theCenter for Science of Information at Purdue Universityas the first IAEA Collaborating Center to support the Agencys activities on artificial intelligence (AI) for nuclear power applications, including reactor design, plant operations, and training and education.Thanks to rapid progress in computational resources and data analysis tools, the nuclear industry has already started to benefit from AI, including with machine learning techniques that can streamline nuclear power plant operations and maintenance. AI is also supporting the development of advanced nuclear power technologies such as small modular reactors (SMRs).With more and more countries looking to nuclear energy to address climate change and sustainable development, this Collaborating Centre will provide much needed support for our Member States in using AI to advance the innovation driving the global nuclear sector, saidMikhail Chudakov, IAEA Deputy Director General and Head of the Department of Nuclear Energy.This Collaborating Centre will help build confidence in AI applications for high consequence systems, such as nuclear reactors. Without reliable quantification, the nuclear communitys ability to realize the potential of AI will be diminished and this will negatively impact its ability to remain competitive in the energy market, saidHany Abdel-Khalik, Professor of Nuclear Engineering at the Center for Science of Information, which advances information theory through collaborative research and teaching.The five-year Collaborating Center agreement will support IAEA programmatic activities and knowledge sharing on advancements and innovation in AI for nuclear power. This includes Agency initiatives on benchmark exercises for developing confidence and community-wide acceptance of Al technology for nuclear power, establishing a benchmarking hub for coordination and data management, as well as other activities relevant to the development and assessment of Al technologies in collaboration with IAEA Member States.AI offers the potential to optimize numerous processes within nuclear power plants. It could be used to bolster efficiency and ensure a steady electricity supply by adjusting power generation based on real-time data, including consumer demand, weather and equipment performance. Automation using robotics and AI systems could handle routine tasks, reducing the need for human input. AI could also improve fuel efficiency and maximize the energy output of reactors.The Collaborating Center agreement is part of recent IAEA efforts to strengthen support to countries interested in using AI for nuclear science and technology. The agreement comes after the Agency recently designated the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Plasma Science and Fusion Center as the first Collaborating Centre focused on accelerating fusion research, with an emphasis on AI applications to advance the IAEAs AI for Fusion initiative.The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) and Kyoto Fusioneering Ltd, a Japanese privately funded fusion technology company, have signed a Communication Framework Agreement to foster partnership on the exchange of knowledge and skills.The agreement enables the collaboration on the development of technology pertaining to tritium breeding blanket design and sets the stage for future joint initiatives, including areas such as tritium fuel cycle, remote handling, and power conversion (thermal cycle) technologies. A breeding blanket is a component to be used in future fusion machines. It is mainly used for producing tritium, which is one of the fuels of fusion reactions. The agreement between the two parties aims to advance blanket technology from its conceptual stage towards commercialization.One of Kyoto Fusioneerings recent contracts with UKAEA involved the development of gyrotron technology for UKAEAs fusion machine, MAST-U, sited at Culham Campus. Gyrotrons can provide high-power microwaves for amplifying fusion reactions. The outcomes of this project intend to provide insights and inform the early designs of STEP, the UKs prototype powerplant to be built at West Burton in Nottinghamshire.When a mix of two forms of hydrogen (deuterium and tritium) is heated to form a controlled plasma at extreme temperatures  10 times hotter than the core of the Sun  they fuse together to create helium and release energy which can be harnessed to produce electricity. There is more than one way of achieving this. UKAEAs approach is to hold this hot plasma using strong magnets in a ring-shaped machine called a tokamak, and then to harness this heat to produce electricity in a similar way to existing power stations.United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) is the UKs national organisation responsible for the research and delivery of sustainable fusion energy. It is an executive non-departmental public body, sponsored by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero.UKAEA is implementing the UKs 650 million Fusion Futures Programme, the UKs alternative program to associating to Euratom R&T, to support the UK Fusion Strategy. The Program entails establishing new facilities at UKAEAs Culham Campus in Oxfordshire to facilitate the advancement of new technologies and expand fusion fuel cycle capabilities.Additionally, a fusion skills package will be introduced focusing on nurturing expertise across a spectrum of disciplines and levels. In 2021, UKAEA opened its Fusion Technology Facility near Rotherham in South Yorkshire, to develop and test materials and components for future fusion powerplants.Kyoto Fusioneering is a privately funded technology start-up founded in 2019 in Kyoto, with its headquarters in Tokyo, Japan. Building upon decades of research at Kyoto University, the company is focused on developing advanced technologies for commercial fusion reactors, including gyrotron systems, tritium fuel cycle technologies, and breeding blankets for tritium production and power generation.If you have an experience or insight to share or have learned something from a conference or seminar, your peers and colleagues on Energy Central want to hear about it.

If Bill Gates could ask someone who traveled to the year 2100 anything about the future, he wouldnt enquire about the future of his bloodline or whether he managed to give away virtually all of his $124 billion fortune before his passing. Instead, the Microsoft founder would want to know whether AI eventually doomed or helped humanity.For me looking into the future, what I want to see is a world where everyone is living a comfortable life, Ritchie said, adding that it would signal whether society has managed to tackle the environmental problems it faces.Shes got a point: Scientists have warned that as carbon pollution heats the planet to ever more dangerous levels, it could trigger devastating domino effects if left unchecked including the loss of whole ecosystems, mass displacement and financial collapse.My assumption would be that climate change hadnt had extremely devastating impacts, where agriculture was ruined and health outcomes were really poor, and people were plunged into poverty, Ritchie said.Since then, the seventh richest person on the planet has maintained that he is glass half-full when it comes to preventing the worst of climate changes devastating impacts because there are already many very promising innovations out thereand AI will only speed up that progress, in his eyes.FORTUNE is a trademark of Fortune Media IP Limited, registered in the U.S. and other countries.

- ASPI and QLE continue to work with potential customers to help resolve the current nuclear fuel supply chain issues. At current prices, ASPI and QLE has customer interest in over $30 billion of HALEU.WASHINGTON, Feb.  16, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ASP Isotopes Inc. NASDAQ: ASPI ("ASP Isotopes or ASPI or the Company), an advanced materials company dedicated to the development of technology and processes for the production of isotopes for use in multiple industries, announced today an update on its previously disclosed intention to spin-out its wholly owned subsidiary, Quantum Leap Energy LLC (QLE), as a separate public company. ASPI is planning to list QLE on a national exchange and distribute a portion of QLEs common equity to ASPIs stockholders as of a future record date, anticipated to be completed by year-end, in each case subject to obtaining applicable approvals and consents and complying with applicable rules and regulations and public market trading and listing requirements.The regulatory landscape and supply chain for nuclear fuel production differs significantly from that of medical isotopes, hence ASPI and QLE have different business models and we believe that both companies would benefit if QLE is independently managed and financed from ASPI.In connection with the anticipated spin-out, ASPI has entered into a number of agreements with QLE, including a License Agreement, pursuant to which QLE has licensed from ASPI the rights to produce enriched Uranium 235 and Lithium 6 in exchange for a perpetual royalty in the amount of 10% of all future QLE revenues, and an EPC Services Framework Agreement, pursuant to which the parties have agreed ASPI will provide services for the engineering, procurement and construction of one or more turnkey Uranium-235 and Lithium-6 enrichment facilities in locations to be identified by QLE and owned or leased by QLE, and commissioning, start-up and test services for each such facility, subject to the receipt of all applicable regulatory approvals, permits, licenses, authorizations, registrations, certificates, consents, orders, variances and similar rights.In addition, ASPI has assigned to QLE the two MOUs with U.S.-based small modular reactor companies for the use of Quantum Enrichment for the production of High-Assay Low Enriched Uranium (HALEU), which were entered into during 2023. The MOUs provide for substantial financial support for the development of HALEU production facilities that should be capable of supplying metric ton quantities of HALEU by 2027. The Companys discussions with potential customers in both the United States and international regions indicate a potential demand for over $30 billion(1) of HALEU at recent market prices by 2037. The Company has initiated discussions with multiple governments regarding the location of their first nuclear fuel facility.ASP Isotopes recently started the construction of the first Quantum Enrichment isotope facility, which is expected to enrich kilogram quantities of ytterbium-176 and nickel-64, two isotopes that are used in the medical industry and are in short supply. This first plant, which is in South Africa, is expected to be completed during 2025 and management believes that the thermodynamic similarities between ytterbium, nickel, lithium, and uranium will mean that the successful construction of this facility would significantly reduce the time required to construct a HALEU facility.Nuclear fuel has one of the most severely compromised supply chains of any material in the world. We believe that in order for long-term climate goals to be achieved, an alternative supplier of fuel is needed, said Paul Mann, Chairman and CEO of ASPI and Chairman and CEO of QLE. Over the last several decades, the scientists at ASPI have developed what we believe to be the most advanced isotope enrichment technologies and we look forward to accelerating these to support long-term climate goals.HALEU will be required to enable many nuclear reactors, such as SMRs (small modular reactors), to operate in the future. Currently, there are no Western producers of HALEU in commercial quantities, and many SMR companies worldwide face substantial delays until this fuel supply issue is resolved. The Nuclear Energy Institute estimates that there may be a HALEU supply demand of approximately 3,000 metric tons by 2035(2). ASPI believes their Quantum Enrichment process will be able to produce HALEU at an attractive price, allowing new nuclear energy to become available at a green discount to carbon-intensive electricity production processes. This green energy cost advantage is expected to help accelerate the global adoption of new nuclear energy, with a corresponding benefit to climate goals. The Quantum Enrichment Process, an isotope enrichment method under development by our scientists, is a laser-based enrichment method, which we believe will have both the lowest levelized cost of HALEU production, the lowest cash operating cost of HALEU production, low capital expenditure, and efficient construction cycles. Management believes that the Quantum Enrichment Process can enrich previously depleted uranium tails, which is essentially waste from other enrichers. In addition to providing a substantial cost advantage over traditional enrichment methods, globally, over 1.7 million metric tons of depleted uranium tails are becoming an environmental hazard.In summary, management believes that QLE will offer an environmental solution for uranium tails whilst providing the lowest cost HALEU supply, which will be essential for the commercialisation of SMRs.ASP Isotopes Inc. is a pre-commercial stage advanced materials company dedicated to the development of technology and processes to produce isotopes for use in multiple industries. The Company employs proprietary technology, the Aerodynamic Separation Process (ASP technology). The Companys initial focus is on producing and commercializing highly enriched isotopes for the healthcare and technology industries. The Company also plans to enrich isotopes for the nuclear energy sector using Quantum Enrichment technology that the Company is developing. The Company has isotope enrichment facilities in Pretoria, South Africa, dedicated to the enrichment of isotopes of elements with a low atomic mass (light isotopes).There is a growing demand for isotopes such as Silicon-28, which will enable quantum computing, and Molybdenum-100, Molybdenum-98, Zinc-68, Ytterbium-176, and Nickel-64 for new, emerging healthcare applications, as well as Chlorine-37, Lithium-6, and Uranium-235 for green energy applications. The ASP Technology (Aerodynamic Separation Process) is ideal for enriching low and heavy atomic mass molecules.

Hello and a big welcome to our new subscribers from Iberdrola, the Finnish Government, Equinor, and more. Euractivs Green Brief brings you a roundup of energy and environment news from across Europe. You can subscribe here.New decade. This week marks the beginning of what many in Brussels consider to be the next phase of the European Green Deal  a new era focused on actually meeting the EUs objective of reaching net-zero emissions by mid-century.The European Commission threw its hat into the ring yesterday when it put forward suggestions for the EUs 2040 climate target. As widely expected, the EU executive recommended a 90% emissions reduction goal, corresponding to the lower end of the 90-95% target range advocated by the EUs Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change.This is expected to lower the EUs dependence on fossil fuels by 80% and unleash low carbon energy solutions such as renewables, nuclear, energy efficiency, storage, CCS, CCU, carbon removals, geothermal and hydro, the EU executive said. Fred Simon has the story.One of the key aspects in the 2040 climate target debate is the place reserved for carbon removals to address residual emissions from sectors like industry and agriculture. According to the Commission proposal, carbon removals should reach up to 400 MtCO2 by 2040 to offset those emissions. But environmental groups fear this will undermine the EUs efforts to reduce industrial carbon ouput in the first place. As a result, the EUs actual climate target for 2040 would be -82%, not -90%, they say.The Commission also got cold feet when it comes to tackling emissions from the agriculture sector amid farmers protests over the blocs green policies. Under pressure from the street and the European Parliament, the Commission finally dropped plans to cut agriculture emissions by at least 30% in the next 25 years. Maria Simon Arboleas reports.Industrial phase. The 90% goal in itself did not come as a surprise  it corresponds to the written commitments made by EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra when he was confirmed in his role by the European Parliament only a few months ago.The Green Deal now needs to become an industrial decarbonisation deal that builds on existing industrial strengths, like wind power, hydropower, and electrolysers, and continues to increase domestic manufacturing capacity in growth sectors like batteries, electric vehicles, heat pumps, solar PV, CCU/CCS, biogas and biomethane, and the circular economy, the Commission said in a statement.This involves creating the right framework conditions for all sectors in the economy as a precondition for meeting the 2040 targets,including on aspects like access to finance, skills, [and] affordable energy, it adds.But achieving this will involve bold steps forward, says Martin Porter from the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership (CISL) in Europe.A deal must consider specific interests, such as those of cleantech manufacturers or materials and energy-intensive producers, within acomprehensive industrial strategy for the whole EU economy, where choices and trade-offs are understood and addressed clearly, he says.To succeed, it must also no longer shy away from thegovernance, common funding, and investment implicationsof doing this effectively at the EU, rather than at the national level, Porter wrote in an op-ed for Euractiv.What we need is the decarbonisation of industry and not a deindustrialisation of Europe, added Peter Liese, a German MEP who is the environment speaker for the centre-right European Peoples Party (EPP), the largest group in Parliament. Read the story here by Nikolaus J. Kurmayer.Chinese makers have recently been flooding the European market with cheap modules due to overcapacity, creating a surplus of imported PV modules in EU warehousesestimated in a range of 7085 Gigawatts.Companies from China sell PV modules below production costs, said the European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC), a trade association. As a result, European producers are unable to sell their own modules, it warned.The EU is now entering a pivotal phase where, over the next 48 weeks, major EU PV module producers and their European suppliers are poised to shut down manufacturing lines unless substantial emergency measures are promptly implemented,the ESMC said. Jonathan Packroff has the details.Brussels cautious. The European Commission joined the fray on Monday when it presented a state of EU solar industry in light of unfair competition during theplenary sessionof the European Parliament.But the EU commissioner for financial services, Mairead McGuinness, warned against imposing anti-dumping tariffs on Chinese panels, saying it would harm the EUs objective of tripling its installed solar capacity by 2030, from 260 GW to 750 GW.Given that we currently rely to a very important degree on imports to reach EU solar deployment targets, any potential measure needs to be weighed against the objectives we have set ourselves when it comes to the energy transition, she told lawmakers, as reported by Reuters.Net-Zero Industry Act. European solar industry representatives also warned against imposing new tariffs on Chinese PV manufacturers, saying this strategy already failed when it was attempted in the 2010s.Rather, the industry is putting its hopes on the Net-Zero Industry Act, which would oblige EU countries to reserve a certain share of their subsidies for solar expansion to modules made outside of China, such as in Europe or the US.A formal legislative proposal will then be prepared by the next European Commission that will be appointed after the June EU elections. This means draft legislation is unlikely to appear before 2025. And it will take at least another year before the 2040 target is formally adopted and added to the European Climate Law.The European Parliament and Council have agreed a provisional deal on historic legislation aimed at ensuring greater transparency and public oversight of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) rating agencies.Germany will abstain from another EU transport law, despite initially signalling agreement, an industry source told Euractiv, as the liberal FDP party is blocking the agreement to the proposed new CO2 standards for trucks which would see the number of diesel trucks drastically reduced.A German government agreement will create state support mechanisms for up to 10 GW of newly-built gas power plants, opening the way for carbon capture in the energy sector and may delay the countrys 2035 plan for a fossil-free power system.STOCKHOLM. Swedish Nord Stream investigation to end soon.

While Moscow isnt thought to have a deployed capability yet, the US believes the Kremlin is dabbling with weaponry that experts say could fundamentally cripple the military and the American way of life.But Kirby was tight-lipped about some key details of the weapon such as whether it was nuclear and underscored that its not a device that can be used to attack human beings or cause physical destruction here on Earth.Everything from navigation and position information whether in our cars or our cell phones using GPS weather forecasting, even TV broadcasts,  the agricultural sector leverages GPS, shipping and transportation, she added.Moscow got a glimpse of this in 2021 when it shot a missile against a satellite, triggering debris that forced two Russian cosmonauts along with their peers on the International Space Station to take cover.Unlike detonating a nuke in space [where] it affects everything within a range of detonation, a high power microwave weapon could target just individual satellites, Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who focuses on defense, warned.In particular, the military is working fast and furious right now to move away from big bulky satellites to constellations of smaller ones  similar to the ones from space guru Elon Musks StarLink system, according to Grant.What makes the satellite constellation as a whole, much less vulnerable [is that] instead of taking out one satellite, theres a whole bunch. And they can then be more easily replaced if something is lost, she said.I think a bigger concern is if theres some new development  what is Russia doing  does this mean that theyre feeling more emboldened? Do they feel that they could threaten to use or actually use capabilities like this? Harrison pondered.With relations already ice-cold between Washington and Moscow as the US mulls whether to ship additional weaponry to Ukraine, the space development is just another example of how things could spiral out of control.

Type One energy has announced its intention to use a retired TVA coal plant site, the Bull Run Fossil Plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, as the site for a prototype fusion reactor with the hope to eventually commercialize fusion power and maybe even find a neat way to use old EV batteries to help power the process.The Bull Run Fossil Plant was a coal-powered generation facility first opened in 1967 and shut down on December 1, 2023 just over two months ago. It was run by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), the largest public utility in the US, and sits just across the river from Oak Ridge, the site of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), one of Americas most important national science labs.Despite only being shut down for two months, claims are already being made on the site. Due to its close location to ORNL, a lab that has studied fusion since the 1950s, it seems a natural choice for another fusion experiment enter Type One energy, a company looking to work toward the commercialization of fusion power.Type One Energy ambitiously gets its name from Type I on the Kardashev scale, a theoretical measurement intended to describe how advanced a civilization is. A Type I civilization is able to harness all of the energy available on a single planet currently, humanitys total energy production is about three orders of magnitude, or a thousand times, below this benchmark.For a basic primer on what were talking about here, Nuclear Fusion differs significantly from Nuclear Fission. Fusion is the reaction that happens inside of stars like our Sun, whereas Fission is what powers current commercial nuclear reactors.Fission, in current nuclear reactors, takes large, rare, radioactive atoms (like Uranium-235) and splits them apart, which releases energy when the bonds between neutrons in the nucleus of these atoms are broken. The major downside is that this reaction creates radioactive material, with nuclear waste still being an unsolved problem.Fusion, however, works by taking smaller atoms and fusing them together. The most promising fusion reaction uses deuterium and tritium, two rare isotopes of hydrogen that have extra neutrons in their nuclei. Deuterium is rare, but still relatively easily found in normal seawater (about one in every 6,000 natural hydrogen atoms are deuterium), whereas tritium is almost nonexistent in nature and would be manufactured by splitting lithium atoms.The upside of fusion is that it does not produce long-lived radioactive waste, and that it is incredibly energetic, with the amount of deuterium in 1 gallon of ordinary seawater (about half a milliliter of deuterium) theoretically able to generate the amount of energy from combusting 300 gallons of oil. Fusion reactors are also considered to be inherently safer as there is no possibility of a meltdown.The downside is that fusion requires extremely difficult conditions to occur, and those conditions cost a lot of energy to maintain. You can get a hint of this by looking at the location where fusion naturally happens at the center of stars, at temperatures of tens of millions of degrees and pressures of trillions of pounds per square inch.So it sounds like a science fiction concept, and ever since it was first envisioned in the 1950s, it has been. Humanity has never been able to achieve a fusion reaction that generated more energy than it took to create until recently.You may have heard the news last year that scientists had achieved net energy gain from a fusion reaction. This means that more energy was released by the fusion reaction than the amount of energy from the lasers used to produce the temperatures needed. This is denoted by the symbol Q, with Q numbers above 1 meaning net energy gain. The current record is Q = 1.54.But thats not everything, because not all of that energy can be effectively harnessed, so in order to reach the point where fusion actually becomes viable for electricity generation, the reaction must create enough energy to become self-sustaining  as long as more deuterium/tritium fuel is added, the reaction will continue, much like adding more logs to an already-burning fireplace.The primary technology advancement needed for the Type One facility is high-temperature superconducting magnets, which have generally seen remarkable progress in recent years and are now the focus of multiple companies working to adapt the basic technology forfusion energy applications. Given what is known from a scientific development standpoint, ORNL considers the step envisioned by Type One as reasonable and achievable. While success is not guaranteed, we view the risk-to-reward profile of this facility as appropriate. Ifsuccessful, the results from this facility would provide a solid basis for a second-generation facility focused on energy production.For a self-sustaining reaction, a ratio of about Q = 5 is thought to be necessary to reach the level of viability for electricity production. But once that milestone is reached, Q increases arbitrarily, because the self-sustaining nature of the reaction means that little to no energy will be needed to be spent externally to maintain the reaction.Type One thinks it can reach this milestone, though probably not for years still it sets the target at about a decade from now. As of now, it wants to build a prototype reactor its calling Infinity One at the Bull Run site, with the intent of retiring risks before building a future pilot power plant.There are a number of other fusion reactors in the world, but most of them are from public institutions run by academic, governmental, or intergovernmental sources. There are a few other fusion startups, but Type One thinks that it will be the first private company to build a functional stellerator prototype. Fusion reactors come in two types: stellerators and tokamaks, with each having their advantages but tokamaks being more common.Many of the companys personnel have already been part of stellerator projects in other settings, so there is plenty of expertise associatedincluding CTO Dr. Thomas Sunn Pederson, who we spoke to for this story, who previously worked on the record-setting W7X stellerator in Germany.The plan has been enough to get the company noticed by some government entities, with the Department of Energy choosing it as one of eight companies to receive part of $46 million in funding. Heres the full list of those companies, six of which ORNL is also partnering with:TVA is a clean energy leader. With the retirement of Bull Run plant, TVA is in the unique position to partner with Type One and ORNL to explore the repurposing of a portion of the facility toward the advancement of fusion energy research. As TVA works to be net-zero by 2050, we must work together to identify potential clean energy technologies of the future. Being able to further the advancement of fusion energy research provides a win-win proposition for TVA and the people of the valley.Despite Type Ones announcement today of its selection to pursue the use of TVAs Bull Run site, TVA issues a reminder that the project is contingent on proper completion of necessary environmental reviews, permits, operating licenses and so on. While TVA has signed a memorandum of understanding with the company and with ORNL, it hasnt yet formally agreed to lease part of the property to Type One. But it does see the unique opportunity to use a former coal for research into the future of energy, especially in a spot thats so close to one of the centers of American fusion research at Oak Ridge labs.This story interested me primarily due to the angle of turning a site that used to generate the dirtiest possible electricity into one that generates what would likely become the cleanest form of electricity, which is quite poetic.And fusion energy, in particular, has incredible promise if its ever achieved. It could solve a tremendous amount of our societal problems but like everything else, this only works if the benefits are properly distributed, and our current sociopolitical systems arent all that great at doing that.Second, Q is not the power out over the power needed to run the lasers. Its the power out to the power in the laser beam. As the article referenced above says, "Energy gain in this context only compares the energy generated to the energy in the lasers, not to the total amount of energy pulled off the grid to power the system, which is much higher."Finally, the experiment that achieved Q>1 was an inertial confinement system (blasting the hydrogen with lasers), which is completely different from magnetic confinement (tokamaks and stellarators). No magnetic confinement experiment has achieved Q>1. And the problem is not that the magnets arent strong enough; its that the plasma keeps finding ways to sneak out of the confinement fields.The upshot is that while its fine for people to work on this, it has nothing to do with solving the global heating crisis. None of this will be ready to produce power before we need to be 90% off fossil fuels. And there is zero chance that it will be cheaper than wind, water, solar, and batteries before we need to be 100% off fossils.But it could, at least, help to solve climate change, by offering a highly energetic energy source that also releases zero emissions, and has even fewer auxiliary impacts than other current clean energy sources (e.g. habitat disruption, panel/turbine recycling, and so on). And, relevant to Electrek, if lithium is needed to make tritium, then that gives us something we could use recycled EV batteries for, which is pretty cool.But we also shouldnt get too far ahead of ourselves here, because it sounds like this project is in very early stages. Todays press release is a pretty minor step Type One is just announcing the site that it wants to use, which hasnt even been secured yet. And while we had a great conversation with Type One, the responses we got from TVA and ORNL were much more noncommittal. So there was an excitement disconnect there, which is to be expected between a company and a government entity, but it still reminded us that all of this is still some ways off.So theres a lot of steps between here and fusion energy, and frankly, I think that the biggest breakthroughs in fusion are not likely to come from a private company but from academic or governmental research, at least for the time being.We will eventually need companies to come in and figure out commercial viability, so getting started on that earlier than later is all well and good, but were still going to be waiting for a while before that viability happens and unfortunately, we dont have time to wait to solve climate change. So, while fusion might help, we still need to get to work now on emissions reductions immediately.

In the past weeks, the Labour Party has dramatically scaled back its 28 billion green investment plans, while the Conservative government has committed to annual licensing rounds in the North Sea in a new oil and gas bill.Wrangling between the Tories and Labour has also opened the door for fringe political activists. Parties such as Reform UK have exploited mixed messaging over climate policy, which the UN authority on climate science, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, says is essential to secure to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all.The campaign has been overshadowed by the sacking of the frontrunner candidate, Azhar Ali, who was dropped by Labour over his controversial comments about the October 7 Hamas attacks. It is too late for Labour to field another candidate, and Ali will now run as an independent.Simon Danczuk, who is standing for Reform UK, and George Galloway, the candidate for the Workers Party of Britain, have both repeatedly attacked the UKs legally binding net zero targets, while Galloway has spread climate misinformation and backed new fossil fuel extraction.This month Danczuk announced he had joined Reform UK. Danczuk was the MP for Rochdale between 2010 and 2017. He is seeking a return to the constituency following his expulsion from the Labour Party in 2015 after sending sexually explicit messages to a 17-year-old (he served as an independent until 2017).Last June he wrote an article attacking the eco-madness of Labours (now scaled back) green investment plans and its pledge not to approve new oil and gas projects. He wrote that Labour see implementing a green ideology as more important than jobs, security and sustaining the economy.The article was published in Spiked, an online libertarian outlet which has a record of climate science denial and fossil fuel-linked funding. Between 2015 and 2018, Spiked received $300,000 from the Charles Koch Foundation, an arm of oil giant Koch Industries and a major funder of climate denial.Danczuk repeated the green ideology argument in an interview with the fringe right-wing outlet Epoch Times, stating: The idea of banning gas and oil exploration in the North Sea, before weve got alternatives in place, is just absolute madness.In September 2023, Danczuk publicly voiced support for the Conservative governments net zero U-turns, telling TalkTV that voters are very despondent about these targets and that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had called it right. TalkTV has its own record of spreading climate denial, and until last year employed Reform leader Richard Tice as a presenter.Reform is campaigning to scrap all of net zero and received 135,000 in donations from climate deniers and fossil fuel interests in 2023. Tice has said CO2 isnt poison, its plant food, while the partys London mayoral candidate Howard Cox has said man is not responsible for global warming.Another ex-Labour Party MP, George Galloway, is standing for the Workers Party of Britain, a party he founded after the 2019 general election. Galloway was expelled from Labour in 2003 for bringing the party into disrepute after a party tribunal found he had incited Arabs to fight British troops and incited British troops to defy orders. He has since been elected to parliament twice  in 2005 for his Respect party and 2012 as an independent  each time serving one term.The party is hostile to climate policies. Its website calls for a much clearer debate on Net Zero and argues that a halt must also be made to the attempt to make working people pay for subsidies for large-scale green industrialisation.Last July the party called for a Brexit-style referendum on net zero, a policy originally pushed by the right-wing Reform UK and led by its honorary president Nigel Farage. (Galloway and Farage have worked together in the past as part of the Aaron Banks-funded Grassroots Out campaign for Brexit.)Galloway has attacked net zero targets, advocated for clean coal extraction and spread misinformation about climate change.In December, Galloway called for a net zero referendum in a post on the social media platform X. On his YouTube talk show in August 2022, Galloway spread the false claim that people would be forced to eat insects to tackle climate change, adding, I think this net zero is one of the biggest hoaxes in modern politics. He then took a swipe at climate activist Greta Thunberg, a regular target for climate deniers, calling net zero a 14-year old schoolgirl leading grown men and women up the garden path.The following month, he again dismissed climate warnings from activists like Thunberg, arguing that the main climate risk came from NATO and the military industrial complex. He said: We are facing climate catastrophe; not man made the likes of Greta Thunberg talks about, but through our own governments.Galloway has also called for more fossil fuel extraction. In an X post in March 2022, a month after Russias full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Galloway wrote: Britain needs to ice its [Net] Zero fantasy, step up its oil exploitation [and] invest in peaceful nuclear energy and seek to re-harvest the 1,000 years of coal under our feet employing clean-coal technology. Our Energy policy is hopelessly unbalanced.From 2008 to 2013, Galloway worked as a presenter for Press TV, the English-language channel run by the Iranian government. From 2013 to 2015 Galloway was paid 100,000 to present a show on RT (Russia Today), Russias equivalent. Both countries are major oil and gas producers. The channels have since had their broadcasting licences revoked by Ofcom for breaking its rules (Galloways broadcasts were not referenced in the ruling).According to a favourable profile in Rochdale Online, Ellison has been active in the local community protecting green spaces, and is credited with winning Rochdale recognition by the Royal Horticultural Society In Bloom awards.He doesnt appear to have commented publicly about Labours weakening of its own net zero plans. Earlier this month, the party dropped its pledge to invest 28 billion per year in green measures, cutting its spending plans by 75 percent to 23.7 billion in total. Labour says it will still keep to its target to decarbonise the UKs power grid by 2030.The party opposes new North Sea exploration, but supports unproven carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology on existing rigs. Earlier this month, Labour leader Keir Starmer said current pipelines would continue for decades.Lib Dem candidate Iain Donaldson has said he wants to hold the government to account on water companies polluting the rivers with filthy sewage, among other issues. In a 2017 tweet he criticised the then U.S. President Donald Trumps withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement.Donaldson was one of eleven of the partys 15 MPs who voted against the Offshore Petroleum Licensing Bill this week, while four abstained. The Liberal Democrats propose moving the net zero target forward five years to 2045 and support large investments in renewable energy.A Liberal Democrat spokesperson said Donaldson had opposed the oil and gas bill, which fails to take vital steps to grow the UK renewable energy sector and reduce energy bills, and fails to form a coherent path to net zero.Iain wants to see the de facto moratorium on onshore wind farms lifted, they added, and allow the expansion of the cheapest form of energy to drive down bills in this cost of living crisis, and reduce our emissions helping to slow climate change.
Almost 50 environmental justice groups on Tuesday sent a letter to leaders of the federally-funded Midwestern hydrogen hub, imploring them not to try to loosen requirements for tax incentives for hydrogen produced with clean energy.The U.S. Treasury in December published draft rules saying that to receive lucrative 45V tax credits for producing clean hydrogen, the energy used must not be diverted from the grid, but be additional energy created specifically to power the electrolysis process used to produce pure hydrogen from water.Environmental advocates are largely pleased with Treasurys draft rules, which also say clean energy must be generated around the same time and near where it is used for hydrogen production, to reap incentives. But organizations are worried that industry groups are lobbying to weaken the draft rules, which are open for public comment through Feb. 26.The Midwest Alliance for Clean Hydrogen (MachH2), a coalition of industry and research groups that won up to $1 billion in Department of Energy hydrogen hub funding, has proposed to produce much pink hydrogen powered by nuclear energy from Illinois. Critics say this, as well as green hydrogen produced with solar and wind, could divert zero-emissions power from other users and hence prolong the lives of fossil-fuel-fired generators that fill the gaps.If MachH2 imperils the achievement of our states climate goals, harms the health of our communities, and causes electricity price spikes that disproportionality impact low- and moderate-income households, it will face stiff opposition from our coalition and from communities that will bear the brunt of harmful, and avoidable, pollution, says the letter from 47 organizations, including We the People of Detroit, Interfaith Power & Light, North Dakota Native Vote, StraightUp Solar, the Sierra Club, Eco-Justice Collaborative and Illinois Peoples Action.The environmental and justice groups praised the draft 45V rules for including three pillars the groups see as crucial to making sure clean hydrogen is truly clean. Those pillars mean clean hydrogen production tax credits will only be awarded if new clean energy is used to power the projects, and the clean energy can actually be delivered to the site of the electrolysis around the time it is needed. The draft rules say that to be considered additional, the energy source must have been built within 36 months before the hydrogen production goes online.Accounting known as hourly matching, which can be verified with Environmental Attribute Certificates, ensures that hydrogen production isnt removing clean energy from the grid that could be used by consumers at times of high demand.A 2023 study by researchers at Princeton Universitys Center for Energy and the Environment modeled the emissions impact that hydrogen production by electrolysis would have in the western U.S., and found that all three pillars would be necessary to ensure overall emissions dont exceed fossil fuel generation.The environmental justice organizations letter notes that the EPA has supported the Treasury departments decision that induced emissions on the grid  caused by replacing electricity diverted for hydrogen production  should be counted as indirect emissions of hydrogen.Backsliding on Treasurys proposed rule would lead to significant emissions increases from hydrogen production, in violation of 45Vs statutory requirements, said the organizations letter. It would also directly harm communities that are home to some of our states dirtiest power plants, which would run more to replace the zero-carbon energy diverted to hydrogen production.Treasury asked for comment on possible exemptions to the additionality requirement, including the possibility that existing nuclear and hydroelectric plants could receive the tax credit, or that existing plants could get the tax credit if it helps them avoid retirement. Advocates have called these possible changes in the rules loopholes. An analysis by the Rhodium Group found these exemptions would generally increase greenhouse gas emissions, compared to modeling under the rules without exemptions.Treasury needs to reject the loopholes industry is demanding, which would create enormous subsidies for dirty hydrogen, lock in more fossil fuel production and use, and increase dangerous health and climate-harming pollution, Piette said. Especially damaging would be any loopholes to the incrementality requirement, which are based on industrys speculative claims about retirement risk, curtailment, and modeling. Such loopholes would reward the hydrogen industry for siphoning critical zero-carbon energy from the grid, creating a massive power demand that would be filled by our dirtiest power plants  the ones that should be retiring, not ramping up.The letter charges that if the three pillars arent mandates for receiving tax incentives, the electricity diverted from the grid to hydrogen production will cause consumers energy bills to spike. They point to cryptocurrency mining as an example of how this phenomenon has played out.Cryptomining, which is subject to minimal constraints and requirements, has increased utility bills by tens to hundreds of millions of dollars for households and businesses in upstate New York and led to costly grid strains in Texas, the letter says.BPs Whiting oil refinery in Northwest Indiana is a focal point of the proposed Midwest hydrogen hub, as the company plans to ramp up hydrogen production at the site and provide it to regional users. BP asked the Treasury department to allow hydrogen made from existing generation to receive tax credits.We encourage the IRS and Treasury to adopt flexible criteria on additionality especially at this nascent stage, said BP Americas comment to the IRS. Strict additionality rules requiring electrolytic hydrogen to be powered by new renewable energy is not practical, especially in the early years, and will severely limit development of hydrogen projects.BP and other members also argued against the requirement for hourly matching of renewable energy generation to use in hydrogen production, arguing instead for yearly matching. The draft rules currently allow for yearly matching until 2028, then hourly matching becomes mandatory.Stringent requirements such as hourly zero-emission matching have the potential to devastate the economics of clean hydrogen production, said BPs comment. Moreover, such restrictive requirements are likely not practical or feasible in these early stages. If a green hydrogen production facility can only produce during hours when wind and solar are available, the low utilization rate will dramatically increase the price of the hydrogen produced.Bloom Energy Corporation, which manufactures electrolyzers, also said that adequate technology does not exist to timestamp energy generation and use in order to ensure that clean energy is generated when it is needed for hydrogen production.Since electrolyzers will comprise a very small percentage of the overall EAC-qualifying energy produced for many years to come, there is ample time for those state, regional and voluntary bodies to work through their stakeholder processes and make any changes as needed to adjust those systems so as to avoid unintended outcomes, said Bloom Energy in its comment, referring to Environmental Attribute Certificates.The Princeton study noted that hourly matching can add considerable costs to hydrogen production, but said the 45V tax credit would be lucrative enough to compensate for those costs while driving the market development of better hourly matching mechanisms.Setting an expectation of hourly matched clean energy will provide a market signal for the clean energy investments needed to further drive decarbonization in the power sector, said the nuclear companys comment.But Constellation is asking for exemptions to additionality, asking the government to decide that hydrogen made with behind-the-meter generation from existing plants qualifies for tax credits. The MachH2 hydrogen hub proposal calls for an electrolyzer on the site of Constellations LaSalle nuclear plant in Illinois, which could provide behind-the-meter electricity. But this electricity would still represent clean power that otherwise could have been sent to the grid, critics say.Measuring carbon content for nuclear fuel is not typically done by the mining, enrichment, fabrication and transport vendors in the nuclear fuel supply chain, and it would be extremely cumbersome, costly, and labor intensive to impose these requirements on said vendors, Constellation said.The letter to MachH2 comes as grassroots groups and environmental organizations are increasingly organizing around still murky but well-funded plans for hydrogen to be used in everything from power generation to steelmaking to transportation, including as part of the seven federally-funded hubs.On February 1, the national collaborative Just Solutions Collective released an Environmental Justice Platform on hydrogen, demanding strict limits on the type of hydrogen production and use that is incentivized as part of a clean energy shift.The organization says hydrogen production from natural gas, and hydrogen produced with power from the grid, should be ruled out since fossil fuel-based hydrogen fails to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, by many estimates. They also demanded strict safety protocols around new hydrogen development, strident protections for water resources, protections around chemicals added to hydrogen fuels, and transparency in all hydrogen-related projects.Just Solutions leaders hope their platform influences policymakers and also helps community groups more effectively weigh in on plans for expanding hydrogen, including as the U.S. Department of Energy invests $7 billion in the seven hydrogen hubs nationwide.The framework is meant to be a resource for climate and environmental justice advocates so they can advance clean energy technology that meaningfully addresses the climate crisis and to stop false solutions from taking root in our communities, Just Solutions senior fellow and strategist Sylvia Chi said in a January webinar.Environmental justice organizations in other parts of the country have also opposed hydrogen hub plans. Last summer Indigenous, environmental justice, and youth groups urged the Biden administration not to fund a hydrogen hub based in Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, and that proposal was not among the seven selected.DOE is saying a lot of the right things, but there is widespread concern that environmental justice is going to be set off to the side and figured out later, after contracts are signed and projects are approved, said Piette. We have yet to hear a clear answer on whether communities will be able to say no to a Hub project. DOE needs to give its own guidance teeth and hold Hubs accountable to local communities, especially those already experiencing cumulative burdens of decades of fossil fuel pollution.The report points to a pilot program in New York state where the Nine Mile nuclear plant is powering hydrogen production. While the nuclear power is zero emissions, it displaces energy from the grid that, when replaced by New Yorks natural gas-heavy energy mix, increases overall greenhouse gas emissions.IEER argues that the ideal place for zero-emissions-produced hydrogen is in areas like California and Texas where theres often much more wind or solar power available than the grid can handle. These renewables are regularly curtailed, or kept off the grid, simply going to waste. A possible exemption to the additionality requirement for tax credits that Treasury has floated includes existing generation during times that renewables would be curtailed.The IEER report estimates that curtailed renewables at current levels could produce 34,000 tons of hydrogen annually in California, and 150,000 tons in Texas. And the availability of renewables in those and other states is only expected to increase.The MachH2 hub is one of the best situated in the country, able to take advantage of excellent wind and solar resources in the Midwest, the letter says. With the anticipated buildout of new renewable energy in this region, the projects funded by the hub will have no difficulty procuring cost-competitive, new, hourly-matched power from the proposed deliverability zone to claim the 45V tax credit.Environmental justice groups ask feds to resist weakening rules on clean hydrogen tax credit is an article from Energy News Network, a nonprofit news service covering the clean energy transition.

Its the coldest time of the year, and the demand for energy is significantly higher as people try to warm their homes. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), in Alabama seven out of ten homes rely on electric heating during the winter months. Increasing demand is placing a strain on our power grid, and the Biden administration has no solution to the problem.Instead of providing families with reliable energy, Joe Biden and his administration have other priorities. Theyve spent the last three years on a crusade to make America dependent on unreliable energy sources such as wind and solar power, all in the name of supposedly fighting climate change. While wind and solar have roles to play in domestic energy production, we simply cannot rely on them. The sun doesnt always shine and the wind doesnt always blow, but our energy grid needs to run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.Despite Joe Bidens best efforts, most of our energy still comes from fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas. Democrats dont like to admit this, but when wind and solar power fail, the backup generators are powered by oil and natural gas. Without fossil fuels, our energy grid and our economy could not function.Right now, nuclear energy accounts for approximately 20% of our power grid, which is more than wind and solar combined. The U.S. has the most nuclear power production of any country in the world, but we could be producing even more. Burdensome regulations and bureaucratic red tape from the Biden administration are slowing down nuclear permitting and production from doing even more.Once again, Democrat politicians would rather play politics than do what is best for the working people of this country. They know their left-wing voter base hates nuclear energyand they wont risk offending them.There is neither an economic nor a scientific basis for opposition to nuclear energy, which is the single most efficient source of energy known to man. It is 8,000 times more efficient than fossil fuelswhich are already much more efficient than wind and solar power. This efficiency grants nuclear power an unparalleled ability to bring down the price of energyand, in turn, reduce prices throughout our economy.Nuclear is also safe for the environment. Nuclear energy produces zero emissions and removes harmful pollutants from the atmosphere. Claims that nuclear energy production is dangerous are simply outdated. After the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, there was a panic among Americans, and the federal government canceled President Nixons goal of building 1,000 nuclear reactors. Despite zero deaths from the Three Mile Island incident, our energy policy has never recovered from this mistake and continues declining with the close of 13 American nuclear reactors since 2013.Scientists are always working to learn from the past and improve our technical knowledge. We know a lot more about nuclear safety now than we did in 1979. Our technology is better than ever and continues to improve each day.Alabama understands this better than almost any state as we are proud to be the nations fifth-largest producer of nuclear energy with two nuclear plants and five nuclear reactors. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) operates Browns Ferry in Athens, Alabama, which is their largest nuclear plant and has the second-largest nuclear power generating capacity in the nation. Browns Ferry directly supports 1,500 Alabama jobs and powers more than two million homes.On the other end of the state, just outside of Dothan, Alabama Power runs Plant Farley, generating nearly 20% of Alabama Powers electricity. Plant Farley supports 900 good jobs in the Wiregrass area, and I am grateful to Alabamas energy workers for keeping the lights on for us.America needs to learn from Alabama. We need to stop the obsession with wind and solar energy and do a better job of investing in nuclear energy. The polls show that a clear majority of the public wants more nuclear powerand that majority is growing by the day. Its good economics. Its good energy policy. Its good environmental policy. And its long overdue.
As the second-largest producer of chemicalsChina is No. 1serious people understand the indispensable role the European chemical sector plays in safeguarding economic prosperity for Europeans. Ours is an industry that drives innovation, job security, and manufactures the products that enable Europe to prosper and thrive. Unfortunately, too many government and business leaders have forgotten how things are made and, as a result, implement self-defeating public policy.For those not yet convinced, allow me to be clear: Nearly every product and technology system necessary to ensure the EUs publicly-declared climate objectives requires a range of complex and technical chemicals that originate fromyou guessed itthe chemical sector. Ignoring this fact and believing European society can simply transition away from nuclear energy, fossil fuels and chemicals, somehow maintain its way of life, and reach its Green Deal objectives, is both naive and dangerous. The truth is that the European Green Deal can only become reality with increased European extraction of minerals and fossil fuels and their refinement into raw materials.Enabling a more prosperous, lower emission future is a goal we all share. Yet, Im regularly puzzled at how many EU and U.S. policymakers overlook basic science and the complex supply chains required to manufacture the marvels of modern life: lighter-weight airplanes and cars, fertilizer, wind turbines and more energy efficient homes.This disconnect has created an existential crisis for the chemical sector in Europe and will hinder economic prosperity and the sustainability ambitions for younger generations. According to many polls, younger citizens are most concerned with the environment and believe a changing climate is an existential crisis for their own lives. The reality is they are the ones most vulnerable to the collapse of the chemical sector because their quality of life will diminish. They will feel the most frauded as electric vehicle batteries and wind turbines become too costly, unprofitable, and impossible to scale. And they will be stuck with the bill.Civil society and NGOs have vilified the chemical industry for decades, ignoring their essential role in lifting humanity. This has led to widespread reluctance to acknowledge the positive and critical role our sector plays in meeting Europes objectives. Future innovation and scaling of green technologies will be impossible if our industry is not preserved in Europe.The combination of increased energy costs and the overwhelming amount of regulation have caused energy intensive companies to question if they can continue to operate in Europe. Eventually, unprofitable businesses cease to exist. This is the worst and most irresponsible outcome for the planet, as industry will be driven to markets with less stringent environmental laws. We will simply see an outsourcing of greenhouse gas emissions to less-regulated markets and more expensive goods made abroad.Policymakers must reflect honestly on where we are as a society and what we want to achieve. While we all want to take action to cut emissions and increase energy efficiency, we also need to face the reality that we do not currently possess all the technologies and energy sources needed to meet Green Deal targets. As we are learning in real time, there is only so much of other peoples money societies can allocate to unprofitable and less reliable energy systems.The upcoming European Commissions Draghi report on the future of EU competitiveness, requested by President Ursula von der Leyen, presents an opportunity for industry leaders to be better consulted, better informed and speak truth to power about the chemical sectors current state of affairs. Europe must do away with EV mandates, speed the transition from coal to natural gas and incentivize companies to modernize existing facilities. The Commission should cut back on some of its regulatory proposals and become familiar with the industrys challenges by implementing existing laws in a way that appropriately manage risk and make peoples lives better.Honest conversations are hard, yet true leadership requires them. Reality and honesty are the only ways forward to the lower emissions and prosperous future envisioned in the European Green Deal. The chemical sector in Europe depends on it.
