Read on to learn how sustainable investing works, some examples of sustainable investing and how to build a socially responsible investment portfolio.In general, sustainable investing can encompass a wide spectrum of investment activities that range from traditional finance to philanthropy, according to Jeff Finkelman, chartered financial analyst and managing director of sustainable investments at Fiduciary Trust International.It includes simple strategies that seek only to avoid certain industries, such as tobacco or firearms, as well as those that strive to generate positive social or environmental change with investments in renewable energy, affordable housing or any number of other challenging markets in need of capital, he said.Sustainable investors often use negative or exclusionary screening to avoid investing in companies that dont meet certain ESG criteria. Using this approach, an investor may refuse to buy a companys securities if it scores poorly compared with its peers on ESG factors.Some investors choose to exclude entire industries from their portfolios. For example, an investor may avoid sin stocks, generally defined as businesses that many people consider unethical, such as tobacco, alcohol, firearms, gambling and adult entertainment. Or you may refuse to invest in oil or nuclear energy stocks due to their environmental impact or in private prisons out of social concerns.Another approach is to use positive screening, also known as a best-in-class approach. Essentially, this is when investors look for companies and sectors that rank better on ESG factors than their peers. For instance, an investor may choose to invest only in companies that rank above at least 50% of their peers based on a number of preselected criteria.While the terms sustainable investing and ESG investing are often used interchangeably, theyre not quite the same thing. ESG investing is one type of sustainable investing, but there are several other strategies that fall under the sustainable investing umbrella.Impact investing is where you aim to achieve measurable environmental or social goals while also earning financial returns. For example, many communities in the US are considered food deserts, which means they have little access to fresh, healthy food. Investing in a grocery store or restaurant that provides healthy food in one of these communities would be a form of impact investing. The goal is to measurably improve the nutrition of residents, but you also aim to earn a profit on your investment.Another approach is to use thematic funds to invest money in a cause that matters to you. You can find mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that invest around an array of themes, such as womens leadership, clean energy and global health care. You could also invest in individual companies that are proactively working to address issues you care about.One of the big misconceptions about sustainable investing is that its less profitable than other investment approaches. The evidence is mixed, though. Some studies suggest that theres no relationship between sustainability factors and a funds performance, while others conclude that sustainable funds perform at least as well as other funds in their peer group.At the individual company level, theres evidence that adherence to sustainable principles is good for profits. Researchers at New York Universitys Stern School of Business found that sustainability initiatives at corporations are associated with more innovation, and that low carbon strategies were linked to positive financial performance.Sustainable investments may also be less risky than companies that dont have a track record of socially responsible practices. For example, a company with a strong commitment to ESG factors are less likely to be at the center of an environmental disaster, a data breach or a fraud case.Sustainable investing matters because it helps you build wealth in a way that doesnt conflict with your conscience. Many people arent comfortable investing in companies that they believe have a negative impact on the world. With sustainable investing, you can earn profits while avoiding companies that have a poor track record of hurting the environment or violating human rights. You can also proactively invest in companies and projects that are doing good in the world.There were more than 600 mutual funds and ETFs focused on sustainable investments as of 2022, according to US SIF: The Sustainable Investment Forum. Here are just a few examples of sustainable investment funds:You dont have to sacrifice profits to invest sustainably. Whether youre investing in mutual funds or ETFs or individual companies and projects, there are a number of ways to earn profits ethically. You can invest in funds or shares of companies based on whether they adhere to specific ESG criteria, or you can avoid investing in companies whose products and practices conflict with your values. Not only can you feel good about the fact that youre investing with a conscience, but some evidence suggests sustainable investing produces superior returns, particularly in the long run.You can invest sustainably by investing in ESG mutual funds and ETFs or by investing in companies that have strong ESG scores. You can also avoid companies that rank poorly on ESG criteria or that have a history of unethical practices. Some people choose to avoid certain types of companies altogether, such as those that make tobacco or firearms.Sustainable investing is a strategy where you aim to have a positive impact on the world. ESG investing and impact investing are two forms of sustainable investing. ESG investors use environmental, social and governance factors to determine whether an investment is sustainable. Impact investing is a strategy where the focus is achieving a measurable goal that benefits the planet or humanity, in addition to earning positive returns.First, make sure you define your values and what causes you care about, as well as any industries or business practices you consider unethical. If youre interested in mutual funds and ETFs, look for funds that invest according to the themes that matter to you or that screen out investments that conflict with your values. If you want to invest in individual companies, look at ESG ratings from third-party agencies, as well as those that are investing in projects you believe can have a positive long-term impact on the world.The editorial content on this page is based solely on objective, independent assessments by our writers and is not influenced by advertising or partnerships.

risk,Chris Sharp is the chief technology officer at Digital Realty, a US business at the intersection of construction and high-tech. It builds data centres, the anonymous warehouses full of computers that keep the online world spinning.Meanwhile, universities, such as the UK's Imperial College London, have for years operated small nuclear reactors for teaching and training purposes. Imperial's own reactor, located just outside London, was operational from 1965 to 2010.Today most companies developing SMRs for commercial use are focusing on helping towns and cities to keep their lights on. However, a clutch of specialist firms have decided that data centres are the best candidates for their SMR designs.In the US, one SMR design from a company called NuScale has already been given the go-ahead by the Office of Nuclear Energy. Meanwhile, in the UK the Office for Nuclear Regulation is continuing to study SMR designs from Rolls-Royce and US tech firm Holtec International.Spencer Lamb, chief commercial officer at British data centre developer Kao Data, doesn't view nuclear-powered facilities in the UK as being something imminent. "I've heard about SMRs, but it will take a long time to deploy a nuclear-configured data centre in the UK, and AI is happening now," he says."People question the viability of nuclear power due to the waste product and risk of an accident," says Mr Gitt. "We recycle the fuel through our reactor multiple times, dealing with the waste, and the new reactors cannot melt-down, they are self-cooling and self-regulating."Mr Gitt declines to reveal if any data centre firms have already signed contracts, but he says that "all the major operators are interested". He adds: "Power is their biggest problem, and they want to deploy this technology within four years, by 2028."So what will a data centre's very own nuclear plant look like? Oklo envisages a large stainless steel tank that contains the SMR dropped into a 50ft (15m) deep hole in the ground. The data centre would then constructed on and around it.
risk,You may have heard that Elon Musks company Neuralink surgically implanted a brain chip in its first human. Dubbed Telepathy, the chip uses neurotechnology in a medical context: It aims to read signals from a paralyzed patients brain and transmit them to a computer, enabling the patient to control it with just their thoughts. In a medical context, neurotech is subject to federal regulations.But researchers are also creating noninvasive neurotech. Already, there are AI-powered brain decoders that can translate into text the unspoken thoughts swirling through our minds, without the need for surgery  although this tech is not yet on the market. In the meantime, you can buy lots of devices off Amazon right now that would record your brain data (like the Muse headband, which uses EEG sensors to read patterns of activity in your brain, then cues you on how to improve your meditation). Since these arent marketed as medical devices, theyre not subject to federal regulations; companies can collect  and sell  your data.With Meta developing a wristband that would read your brainwaves and Apple patenting a future version of AirPods that would scan your brain activity through your ears, we could soon live in a world where companies harvest our neural data just as 23andMe harvests our DNA data. These companies could conceivably build databases with tens of millions of brain scans, which can be used to find out if someone has a disease like epilepsy even when they dont want that information disclosed  and could one day be used to identify individuals against their will.In the US, the action is so far happening on the state level. The Colorado House passed legislation this month that would amend the states privacy law to include the privacy of neural data. Its the first state to take that step. The bill had impressive bipartisan support, though it could still change before its enacted.Minnesota may be next. The state doesnt have a comprehensive privacy law to amend, but its legislature is considering a standalone bill that would protect mental privacy and slap penalties on companies that violate its prohibitions.But preventing a company from harvesting brain data in one state or country is not that useful if it can just do that elsewhere. The holy grail would be federal  or even global  legislation. So, how do we protect mental privacy worldwide?Rafael Yuste, a Columbia University neuroscientist, started to get freaked out by his own neurotech research a dozen years ago. At his lab, employing a method called optogenetics, he found that he could manipulate the visual perception of mice by using a laser to activate specific neurons in the visual cortex of the brain. When he made certain images artificially appear in their brains, the mice behaved as though the images were real. Yuste discovered he could run them like puppets.In 2017, Yuste gathered around 30 experts to meet at Columbias Morningside campus, where they spent days discussing the ethics of neurotech. As Yustes mouse experiments showed, its not just mental privacy thats at stake; theres also the risk of someone using neurotechnology to manipulate our minds. While some brain-computer interfaces only aim to read whats happening in your brain, others also aim to write to the brain  that is, to directly change what your neurons are up to.The group of experts, now known as the Morningside Group, published a Nature paper later that year making four policy recommendations, which Yuste later expanded to five. Think of them as new human rights for the age of neurotechnology:So Yuste connected with Jared Genser, an international human rights lawyer who has represented clients like the Nobel Peace Prize laureates Desmond Tutu and Aung San Suu Kyi. Together, Yuste and Genser created a nonprofit called the Neurorights Foundation to advocate for the cause.They soon notched a major win. In 2021, after Yuste helped craft a constitutional amendment with a close friend who happened to be a Chilean senator, Chile became the first nation to enshrine the right to mental privacy and the right to free will in its national constitution. Mexico, Brazil, and Uruguay are already considering something similar.Ultimately, Yuste wants a new international treaty on neurorights and a new international agency to make sure countries comply with it. He imagines the creation of something like the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors the use of nuclear energy. But establishing a new global treaty is probably too ambitious as an opening gambit, so for now, he and Genser are exploring other possibilities.Were not saying that there necessarily need to be new human rights created, Genser told me, explaining that he sees a lot of promise in simply updating current interpretations of human rights law  for example, extending the right to privacy to include mental privacy.Thats relevant both on the international level  hes talking to the UN about updating the provision on privacy that appears in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  and on the national and state levels. While not every nation will amend its constitution, states with a comprehensive privacy law could amend that to cover mental privacy.Thats the path Colorado is taking. If US federal law were to follow Colorado in recognizing neural data as sensitive health data, that data would fall under the protection of HIPAA, which Yuste said would alleviate much of his concern. Another possibility would be to get all neurotech devices recognized as medical devices so they would have to be approved by the FDA.At Vox, we believe that clarity is power, and that power shouldnt only be available to those who can afford to pay.

risk,The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and Kairos Power have signed a Technology Investment Agreement to implement an Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) risk reduction award, for which the company was selected in December 2020, to support the design, construction, and commissioning of the Hermes demonstration reactor in Oak Ridge, Tenn.Under the agreement, DOE will provide up to $303 million to Kairos Power using a performance-based, fixed-price milestone approach. The the company will receive fixed payments upon demonstrating it has achieved significant project milestones.The contracting method has been used by the Department of Defense and follows the significant precedent in NASAs successful Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program. It has proven to be a flexible and effective model to support the development and demonstration of complex technologies through federal partnerships with commercial companies.Mike Laufer, Kairos Power co-founder and CEO said in a press statement, With the use of fixed-price milestone payments, this innovative contract provides real benefits to both Kairos Power and DOE to ensure the successful completion of the Hermes reactor. It allows us to remain focused on achieving the most important goals of the project while retaining agility and flexibility to move quickly as we learn key lessons through our iterative development approach.Emphasizing the importance of the contract award, Dr. Kathryn Huff, Assistant Secretary, Office of Nuclear Energy, said in a press statement, The Hermes reactor is an important step toward realizing advanced nuclear energys role in ushering forward the nations clean energy transition, said Partnerships like this one play a significant role in making advanced nuclear technology commercially competitive.On its website the firm said it has since being selected for the ARDP award, Kairos Power has made steady progress on its pathway to demonstration, standing up extensive testing and manufacturing infrastructure to deliver the Engineering Test Unit series and advancing its fuel and molten salt coolant workstreams.In December 2023, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued a construction permit to Kairos Power for the Hermes demonstration reactor. Hermes will demonstrate the companys ability to deliver clean, safe, and affordable nuclear heat and represents a critical step on Kairos Powers iterative pathway to commercializing its advanced reactor technology.(NucNet) AtkinsRalis and state-owned Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) have signed a memorandum of understanding to collaborate on deploying Candu nuclear power reactors around the world. The MOU will be followed by collaboration and licensing agreements that will accelerate the development of Candu reactor technology, including the large-scale1,000 MW Monark designthat was unveiled in November 2023.AtkinsRalis, a Montreal-based nuclear technology and engineering company that is part of Canadas SNC-Lavalin Group, told NucNet it is aiming to deploy its firstMonark nuclear plantin Canada by about 2034-2035 and is targeting markets as far afield as South America, Asia and Australia.CANDU reactor technology was developed in Canada in the 1950s and 1960s by a partnership that included AECL. According to the Canadian Nuclear Associations website, there are 34 Candu plants globally, 30 of which are operable. Nineteen of those plants are in Canada with the rest in Argentina, China, India, Pakistan, Romania and South Korea.AtkinsRalis said as the original equipment manufacturer and steward of CANDU technology, it partners with a nationwide nuclear supply chain of more than 250 companies that employ 76,000 people and provides fuel, components, services and tooling.The Monark, at 1,000 MW, is the most advanced reactor design with the highest output of any CANDU technology. AtkinsRalis said large-scale nuclear reactors are increasingly sought-after by utilities and governments as they look to decarbonize power grids, produce stable baseload power that is not weather-dependent and increase energy security.In September, the Canadian government agreed to provide export financing to support complet4ion of two CANDU reactors in Romania. These additional plants at the Cernavoda site would take nuclear powers share of Romanias electricity production to 36%.The Indian government is in talks with Reliance Industries, Tata Power, Adani Power, and Vedanta Ltd to invest nearly $5.30 billion each from them. The report, quoting two sources, mentioned the Department of Atomic Energy and the state-run Nuclear Power Corp. of India (NPCIL) have held multiple rounds of discussions with private companies in the past year on the investment plan. The government hopes to build 11,000 megawatts (MW) of new nuclear power generation capacity by 2040.This is the first time India is pursuing private investment in nuclear power. The funding would help India achieve its target of having 50% of its installed electric generation capacity use non-fossil fuels by 2030, up from 42% now.The government is asking the private companies will make investments in the nuclear plants, acquire land and water, and undertake construction in areas outside the reactor complex of the plants. However, the responsibility and rights to build and run the power stations and their fuel management will rest with NPCIL. However, the private companies are expected to earn revenue from the power plants electricity sales, and NPCIL would operate the projects for a fee.According to a Reuters wire service report, in August 2023, Minister of State Jitendra Singh also told the countrys parliament that the government was considering options for small modular reactors, and looking at ways to allow the participation of the private sector and start-ups in such projects.India is currently building a fleet of 10 700 MW PHWR nuclear power plants using a 100% India supply chain for the domestic designed CANDU type reactor. Anther seven units are planned once the first ten are complete. India has blocked foreign direct investment in its nuclear sector by passing a supplier liability law that blocks all but state owned enterprises that self-insure. Westinghouse and GE Hitachi exited the market as a resultRussia has built and commissioned two 1000 MW VVER reactors at Kudankulam in Tamil Nadu, is building two more, and has recently completed discussions with NPCIL for a third pair at the same site. Efforts by Frances EDF to build six 1650 MW EPRs at Jaitapur on Indias west coast have been stalled for more than a decade over objections by NPCIL about costs.At $6,000/Mw the two EPR reactors would cost almost $20 billion. By comparison, India claims to be building its 700 MW PHWRs for about half that amount or about $2 billion each. Roughly speaking, India could build its entire fleet of 10 PHWRs for the cost of the twin EPRs not counting cost and schedule delays for the EPRs which have a poor track record in terms of project controls.South Korea will invest in developing its the small modular reactor (SMR) foundry business. President Yoon Suk Yeol said at a town hall meeting in Changwon that the government will develop the southeastern city ofChangwonand its surrounding area South Gyeongsang Province into an SMR manufacturing hub.Changwon will see the countrys new SMR cluster, trade, industry and energy minister Ahn Duk-geun said at the presidents town hall meeting. The city is full of companies with superb nuclear power equipment manufacturing capabilities.Since SMRs are expected to be manufactured and installed in modular forms, the plan is to produce them at factories. Given the limited number of countries with nuclear reactor manufacturing technology, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said the government will step up policy efforts to take the lead in the SMR market.The government significantly increases the budget to develop and export small modular reactors by 2028 by more than nine times to about $49 billion this year. It plans to launch South Korean SMRs in the global market. South Korea has several PWR type designs for SMRs that are in the development stage. It is also a possibility that South Korean heavy industry firms may license SMR designs already or nearly complete in other countries.The government will also offer tax benefits to SMR and nuclear power plant manufacturers. The trade ministry estimates that such tax benefits will lead to an increase in R&D spending and facility investment in the sector by more than $750 million this year alone.The government has earmarked $3 billion for next-generation nuclear power plant R&D through 2027 when President Yoons five-year term ends. This year, the government also plans to draw up a mid- to long-term policy roadmap to support the nuclear energy sector, upon legislation of the special act for the nuclear power industry.Rolls-Royce has been promoting its 470 MW PWR type mid-size reactor as a solution to the nations energy needs. The firm has presented a plans for 16 of them to be built at various sites around the nation.However, the process to select which model of small nuclear reactor, among a field of six competitors, is used in Britain has been beset by delays. Bureaucratic disputes about funding and policy issues has tied up a plan to make multiple awards of significant funding for SMRs. A prior SMR competition in 2015 ended without any significant awards of funding.As a result of the current delays,Tufan Erginbilgic, CEO at Rolls-Royce, says that the first Rolls-Royce mini nuclear reactor will be built in Europe instead of Britain if UK ministers continue on a path of failure to make up their minds about SMRs.Erginbilgic said he was confident the companys small modular reactor (SMR) technology was still far ahead of competitors. He told the Telegraph newspaper that time was running out for the UK to benefit from its first mover advantage, as Rolls has also held talks about deploying SMRs in eastern Europe.His claims about market advantage in Poland, Romania, and other countries need to be taken with grain or two of salt as several other firms including GE-Hitachi and NuScale, among others, have made inroads in developing sale prospects with these nations.Erginbilgics complaints come asGreat British Nuclear(GBN), the public body set up to lead the UKs nuclear power revival, is preparing to choose which SMR prototypes to support from a shortlist of six companies, including Rolls-Royce. GBN had promised to make the awards this spring, but that date is now in doubt according to news reports.In the UK, the company is the only SMR developer to have reached the second stage of the new generic design assessment process for nuclear reactors, with CEO Erginbilgic arguing this puts it in pole position in the GBN competition.Westinghouse Electric Company announced the signing of a contract with the Dutch government to conduct a Technical Feasibility Study (TFS) assessing the deployment of AP1000 reactors in support of their nuclear new-build strategy.This comprehensive study will evaluate deployment of two AP1000 nuclear reactors at theBorssele Nuclear Power Station. The TFS represents a significant step forward in the countrys strategy to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, aligning with the European Unions climate goals and the Dutch commitment to carbon-neutral electricity production by 2035.Borssele, in the province of Zeeland in the southwest of the Netherlands, is the countrys only commercial nuclear power station. It has a single 482-MW pressurized water reactor unit that began commercial operation in 1973. In December 2022 the Dutch government chose the Borssele site as its preferred location for the proposed construction of two new nuclear power reactor units. The government is also considering reactors from Frances EDF, South Koreas KHNP, and Westinghouse. Reactors from Russia or China are not under consideration.(NucNet) The construction of the first phase of China National Nuclear Corporations Jinqimen nuclear power station has officially begun in Zhejiang province, eastern China. The Jinqimen-1 and -2 project will have two indigenous Hualong One, or HPR1000 pressurized water reactor units.Hualong One (HPR 1000) is the 3rd-generation nuclear power brand to which China has exclusive intellectual property rights. HPR 1000 is jointly developed by the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) and the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN).It has a 177 assembly core design with an 18-month refuelling cycle with 4.45% enriched fuel. The power plants utilization rate is as high as 90%. CNNC has said its active and passive safety systems, double-layer containment and other technologies meet the highest international safety standards.Chinese state owned news media reports are that all core components are manufactured in China and that 17 universities and research institutions, 58 state-owned enterprises, and over 140 private firms across China worked on Hualong Ones development to ensure all core components were able to be produced domesticallyThe Kairos reactor is pushing-the-envelope in a whole host of technical, safety, and operational areas. The economics of the approach cannot be evaluated owing to the very high levels of uncertainty just noted.I cannot help but suspect this is yet another example of a heavily taxpayer funded DOE research effort unlikely to succeed in the commercial marketplace. The cost of the long-line of earlier DOE misadventures is in the ten-of-billions of dollars. Perhaps the scientists should take a more pragmatic approach.If you have an experience or insight to share or have learned something from a conference or seminar, your peers and colleagues on Energy Central want to hear about it.

risk,(Article by Kevin Stocklin republished from TheEpochTimes.com) The United States has become so utterly dependent upon an uninterrupted supply of affordable electricity that, as our grid becomes ever more fragile, American society has become fragile along with it. Former CIA director James Woolsey testified before the U.S. Senate in 2015 that, if Americas electric grid were to go down for an extended period, such as one year, there are essentially two estimates on how many people would die from hunger, from starvation, from lack of water, and from social disruption. One estimate is that within a year or so, two-thirds of the United States population would die, Mr. Woolsey said. The other estimate is that within a year or so, 90 percent of the U.S. population would die. Chris Keefer, president of Canadians for Nuclear Energy, concurred. The energy grid is a civilizational life support system, and without it, modern society collapses very quickly, he said. Mr. Keefer is one of the experts featured in energy analyst, author, and documentarian Robert Bryces new film, Juice: Power, Politics and the Grid. This five-part docuseries looks at how and why America is now fragilizing and destabilizing the engineering marvel that is the central pillar of our society. We are seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, Mr. Bryce told The Epoch Times. We wanted to get people and policy makers to understand that our most important energy network is being fragilized, and we ignore this danger at our peril. Steven Pinker, author and Harvard psychology professor, wrote in a review of the book that energy is our primary defense against poverty, disorder, hunger, and death. And yet, many nations in the West have engaged in a game of Russian roulette with their power grids, in an attempt to reduce global temperatures.  A Dire Warning The warnings dont just come from the analysts featured in the documentary; electricity regulators are becoming more vocal in sounding the alarm as well. In a May 2023 report, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), charged with overseeing grid reliability, stated that a majority of Americas grid is now at heightened risk levels for outages. This report is an especially dire warning that Americas ability to keep the lights on has been jeopardized, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association CEO Jim Matheson stated. It was the near-collapse of Texass power grid during winter storm Yuri in 2021 that compelled Mr. Bryce to make the documentary. He partnered with film director Tyson Culver, who along with Mr. Bryce, experienced the crisis first-hand while living in Austin. I didnt plan to make another documentary after we made our first film that we released in 2019, he said. I just thought, I cant do this; it costs too much and takes too long. But then we learned that the [Texas] grid nearly failed, and if it had failed, tens of thousands of people would have died, he said. And we realized, if this could happen in Texas, the energy capital of the world, then the electric grid is really being undermined. The North American electric grid is rapidly being transitioned from one in which coal had once dominated to one that is seeing an ever increasing share of wind, solar, and natural gas. In the process, Americas electric grid is changing from something that was once so reliable that consumers rarely thought about it, to one that increasingly features rolling blackouts and may, one day soon, be on the brink of long-term failure.The Fatal Trifecta The destabilization of the power grid is the result of what analyst and author Meredith Angwin deems the fatal trifecta. The Texas grid almost collapsed because of what I call the fatal trifecta, Ms. Angwin states. The first part of the fatal trifecta is over reliance on renewables, which go on and off when they want to. The second part is over reliance on natural gas, which is delivered just in time and can be interrupted just in time, she says. And the third part is relying on a neighbor to help. All of these factors came into play during Texas winter storm Yuri in 2021. Wind and solar facilities were unable to deliver in freezing weather, and supplies of natural gas were interrupted by freezing temperatures as well, just as people needed electricity to heat their homes. According to a Texas comptrollers report, natural gas supplied 51 percent of Texas electricity; wind 25 percent; and coal 13 percent. As these sources went offline, utilities frantically enacted blackouts to cut demand, fearing that a mismatch of supply and demand that lasted more than several minutes would cause long-term damage to the grids hardware. While Texas missed having a months-long outage of its electric grid by only a matter of minutes, the damage from short-term outages was severe. Rolling blackouts were intended to take stress off the power grid but turned into outages thatin some parts of the statelasted several days, the report stated. In that short time, at least 210 deaths were attributed to the outage, which also caused an estimated $195 billion in economic damage. The third leg of the fatal trifecta is the ability of regions of the grid to support each other. For all its fragmented sources, utilities, and regulations, the North American power grid is interconnected in a way that allows one region to shift electricity to another region if one has an excess and the other a shortfall. Utilities routinely rely on this to balance supply and demand at any given moment. Increasingly, however, with excess reserves dwindling as coal plants are aggressively shut down across the United States, this ability to phone a friend is going away.Following Europe and California In many ways, Texas followed the lead of Europe and California in transitioning their grid to wind and solar energy, retiring coal plants and sometimes nuclear plants as well, to halt global warming and please anti-nuclear activists. Because wind and solar are weather-dependent, a dispatchable backup source is needed, and that source is typically natural gas. As Europe, California, and Texas have learned, this transition creates vulnerability compared to coal and nuclear plants, where fuel can be stored on-site. It has also led to sharply increasing prices for electricity, as dual systems of power generation need to be built, along with additional transmission infrastructure. According to a 2021 Princeton Study, relying on wind and solar to achieve net zero by 2050 would require Americas high-voltage transmission network to triple in size, at a cost of $2.4 trillion. In what appears to be a surrender, or at least a retreat, from the net-zero transition, some European countries, like Germany, are restarting their coal plants as wind and solar fail to meet demand, even at inflated prices. What we see in Europe from this misguided infatuation with renewables is a stark warning, and I think we can see the same thing in Californiaskyrocketing electricity prices and no significant reduction in CO2 to speak of, Mr. Bryce said. At the same time, the drive to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions has led to political and corporate campaigns to shift ever more products onto the electric grid. This includes such essentials as home heating, transportation, and cooking. Laws and regulations in Europe and the United States have sought to ban or phase out oil and gas heating in homes, along with gasoline-powered cars, trucks, and buses. The effect of this will be to make people more dependent on electricity while pushing up demand to levels that many say the grid cannot meet. The grid is already cracking under existing demand, Mr. Bryce said. Were seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, while these pressure groups are trying to put yet more demand on it. This is a date with disaster.Wind and Solar Devour Open Spaces Added to this is the insatiable hunger of the wind and solar industry for the consumption of land. According to a May report by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), reaching the goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050 would consume more than 250,000 square miles, or 160 million acres, of land. With current siting practices, an area the size of Texas is required to accommodate the wind and solar infrastructure we need to reach nationwide net-zero emissions by 2050, stated Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at TNC, a renewable energy advocate. Many energy experts and environmentalists are coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is the best choice to generate reliable, affordable energy, while cutting CO2 emissions. Despite headline nuclear catastrophes at plants in Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, many countries are building new plants or delaying closures of existing nuclear plants, considering it the cleanest and least environmentally harmful source of electricity. According to a report by the Nuclear Energy Institute, wind farms require up to 360 times as much land area to produce the same amount of electricity as a nuclear energy facility, and solar facilities require up to 75 times the land area. Compared to coal and natural gas plants, wind and solar consume at least 10 times as much land, according to the left-leaning Brookings Institution. In addition to a smaller footprint, nuclear power stations also typically do not require the construction of thousands of miles of new transmission lines to reach remote locations, where wind and solar facilities are typically built. With nuclear, Mr. Bryce said, we dont need to expand the grid; we can use the grid we have.Climate Activists Embrace Nuclear Even ardent supporters of green-new-deal initiatives are starting to accept that nuclear must be at least part of the plan. What were seeing out of Congress, and to some extent out of this White House, is more accommodation for nuclear energy, Mr. Bryce said. A 2022 report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reports that France, the EUs leading atomic state with nuclear weapons and fifty-six power reactors, is poised to launch a major reinvestment in nuclear power. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland are also preparing to build new nuclear reactors, the report states, while other European nationsAustria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and Portugalremain opposed to nuclear power. California regulators, meanwhile, opted in December 2023 to keep the states nuclear facility at Diablo Canyon open through at least 2030, having previously ordered its closure in 2025. This is a retreat for a state that has been plagued with rolling blackouts as it jumped headlong into a wind and solar future. If we are going to agree that climate change is an issue, with more [weather] extremes for longer, its total insanity to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather, Mr. Bryce said. We need weather-resilient, weather-resistant generation, not weather-dependent generation. With the Inflation Reduction Act and the investment tax credits, production tax credits, all of the financial incentives in the power-gen sector are to build more wind and solar, he said. To me, that is just absolute crazy town. The documentary is available to watch for free on YouTube or at juicetheseries.com. Read more at:TheEpochTimes.com(Article by Kevin Stocklin republished from TheEpochTimes.com) The United States has become so utterly dependent upon an uninterrupted supply of affordable electricity that, as our grid becomes ever more fragile, American society has become fragile along with it. Former CIA director James Woolsey testified before the U.S. Senate in 2015 that, if Americas electric grid were to go down for an extended period, such as one year, there are essentially two estimates on how many people would die from hunger, from starvation, from lack of water, and from social disruption. One estimate is that within a year or so, two-thirds of the United States population would die, Mr. Woolsey said. The other estimate is that within a year or so, 90 percent of the U.S. population would die. Chris Keefer, president of Canadians for Nuclear Energy, concurred. The energy grid is a civilizational life support system, and without it, modern society collapses very quickly, he said. Mr. Keefer is one of the experts featured in energy analyst, author, and documentarian Robert Bryces new film, Juice: Power, Politics and the Grid. This five-part docuseries looks at how and why America is now fragilizing and destabilizing the engineering marvel that is the central pillar of our society. We are seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, Mr. Bryce told The Epoch Times. We wanted to get people and policy makers to understand that our most important energy network is being fragilized, and we ignore this danger at our peril. Steven Pinker, author and Harvard psychology professor, wrote in a review of the book that energy is our primary defense against poverty, disorder, hunger, and death. And yet, many nations in the West have engaged in a game of Russian roulette with their power grids, in an attempt to reduce global temperatures.  A Dire Warning The warnings dont just come from the analysts featured in the documentary; electricity regulators are becoming more vocal in sounding the alarm as well. In a May 2023 report, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), charged with overseeing grid reliability, stated that a majority of Americas grid is now at heightened risk levels for outages. This report is an especially dire warning that Americas ability to keep the lights on has been jeopardized, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association CEO Jim Matheson stated. It was the near-collapse of Texass power grid during winter storm Yuri in 2021 that compelled Mr. Bryce to make the documentary. He partnered with film director Tyson Culver, who along with Mr. Bryce, experienced the crisis first-hand while living in Austin. I didnt plan to make another documentary after we made our first film that we released in 2019, he said. I just thought, I cant do this; it costs too much and takes too long. But then we learned that the [Texas] grid nearly failed, and if it had failed, tens of thousands of people would have died, he said. And we realized, if this could happen in Texas, the energy capital of the world, then the electric grid is really being undermined. The North American electric grid is rapidly being transitioned from one in which coal had once dominated to one that is seeing an ever increasing share of wind, solar, and natural gas. In the process, Americas electric grid is changing from something that was once so reliable that consumers rarely thought about it, to one that increasingly features rolling blackouts and may, one day soon, be on the brink of long-term failure.The Fatal Trifecta The destabilization of the power grid is the result of what analyst and author Meredith Angwin deems the fatal trifecta. The Texas grid almost collapsed because of what I call the fatal trifecta, Ms. Angwin states. The first part of the fatal trifecta is over reliance on renewables, which go on and off when they want to. The second part is over reliance on natural gas, which is delivered just in time and can be interrupted just in time, she says. And the third part is relying on a neighbor to help. All of these factors came into play during Texas winter storm Yuri in 2021. Wind and solar facilities were unable to deliver in freezing weather, and supplies of natural gas were interrupted by freezing temperatures as well, just as people needed electricity to heat their homes. According to a Texas comptrollers report, natural gas supplied 51 percent of Texas electricity; wind 25 percent; and coal 13 percent. As these sources went offline, utilities frantically enacted blackouts to cut demand, fearing that a mismatch of supply and demand that lasted more than several minutes would cause long-term damage to the grids hardware. While Texas missed having a months-long outage of its electric grid by only a matter of minutes, the damage from short-term outages was severe. Rolling blackouts were intended to take stress off the power grid but turned into outages thatin some parts of the statelasted several days, the report stated. In that short time, at least 210 deaths were attributed to the outage, which also caused an estimated $195 billion in economic damage. The third leg of the fatal trifecta is the ability of regions of the grid to support each other. For all its fragmented sources, utilities, and regulations, the North American power grid is interconnected in a way that allows one region to shift electricity to another region if one has an excess and the other a shortfall. Utilities routinely rely on this to balance supply and demand at any given moment. Increasingly, however, with excess reserves dwindling as coal plants are aggressively shut down across the United States, this ability to phone a friend is going away.Following Europe and California In many ways, Texas followed the lead of Europe and California in transitioning their grid to wind and solar energy, retiring coal plants and sometimes nuclear plants as well, to halt global warming and please anti-nuclear activists. Because wind and solar are weather-dependent, a dispatchable backup source is needed, and that source is typically natural gas. As Europe, California, and Texas have learned, this transition creates vulnerability compared to coal and nuclear plants, where fuel can be stored on-site. It has also led to sharply increasing prices for electricity, as dual systems of power generation need to be built, along with additional transmission infrastructure. According to a 2021 Princeton Study, relying on wind and solar to achieve net zero by 2050 would require Americas high-voltage transmission network to triple in size, at a cost of $2.4 trillion. In what appears to be a surrender, or at least a retreat, from the net-zero transition, some European countries, like Germany, are restarting their coal plants as wind and solar fail to meet demand, even at inflated prices. What we see in Europe from this misguided infatuation with renewables is a stark warning, and I think we can see the same thing in Californiaskyrocketing electricity prices and no significant reduction in CO2 to speak of, Mr. Bryce said. At the same time, the drive to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions has led to political and corporate campaigns to shift ever more products onto the electric grid. This includes such essentials as home heating, transportation, and cooking. Laws and regulations in Europe and the United States have sought to ban or phase out oil and gas heating in homes, along with gasoline-powered cars, trucks, and buses. The effect of this will be to make people more dependent on electricity while pushing up demand to levels that many say the grid cannot meet.

One estimate is that within a year or so, two-thirds of the United States population would die, Mr. Woolsey said. The other estimate is that within a year or so, 90 percent of the U.S. population would die. Chris Keefer, president of Canadians for Nuclear Energy, concurred. The energy grid is a civilizational life support system, and without it, modern society collapses very quickly, he said. Mr. Keefer is one of the experts featured in energy analyst, author, and documentarian Robert Bryces new film, Juice: Power, Politics and the Grid. This five-part docuseries looks at how and why America is now fragilizing and destabilizing the engineering marvel that is the central pillar of our society. We are seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, Mr. Bryce told The Epoch Times. We wanted to get people and policy makers to understand that our most important energy network is being fragilized, and we ignore this danger at our peril. Steven Pinker, author and Harvard psychology professor, wrote in a review of the book that energy is our primary defense against poverty, disorder, hunger, and death. And yet, many nations in the West have engaged in a game of Russian roulette with their power grids, in an attempt to reduce global temperatures.  A Dire Warning The warnings dont just come from the analysts featured in the documentary; electricity regulators are becoming more vocal in sounding the alarm as well. In a May 2023 report, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), charged with overseeing grid reliability, stated that a majority of Americas grid is now at heightened risk levels for outages. This report is an especially dire warning that Americas ability to keep the lights on has been jeopardized, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association CEO Jim Matheson stated. It was the near-collapse of Texass power grid during winter storm Yuri in 2021 that compelled Mr. Bryce to make the documentary. He partnered with film director Tyson Culver, who along with Mr. Bryce, experienced the crisis first-hand while living in Austin. I didnt plan to make another documentary after we made our first film that we released in 2019, he said. I just thought, I cant do this; it costs too much and takes too long. But then we learned that the [Texas] grid nearly failed, and if it had failed, tens of thousands of people would have died, he said. And we realized, if this could happen in Texas, the energy capital of the world, then the electric grid is really being undermined. The North American electric grid is rapidly being transitioned from one in which coal had once dominated to one that is seeing an ever increasing share of wind, solar, and natural gas. In the process, Americas electric grid is changing from something that was once so reliable that consumers rarely thought about it, to one that increasingly features rolling blackouts and may, one day soon, be on the brink of long-term failure.The Fatal Trifecta The destabilization of the power grid is the result of what analyst and author Meredith Angwin deems the fatal trifecta. The Texas grid almost collapsed because of what I call the fatal trifecta, Ms. Angwin states. The first part of the fatal trifecta is over reliance on renewables, which go on and off when they want to. The second part is over reliance on natural gas, which is delivered just in time and can be interrupted just in time, she says. And the third part is relying on a neighbor to help. All of these factors came into play during Texas winter storm Yuri in 2021. Wind and solar facilities were unable to deliver in freezing weather, and supplies of natural gas were interrupted by freezing temperatures as well, just as people needed electricity to heat their homes. According to a Texas comptrollers report, natural gas supplied 51 percent of Texas electricity; wind 25 percent; and coal 13 percent. As these sources went offline, utilities frantically enacted blackouts to cut demand, fearing that a mismatch of supply and demand that lasted more than several minutes would cause long-term damage to the grids hardware. While Texas missed having a months-long outage of its electric grid by only a matter of minutes, the damage from short-term outages was severe. Rolling blackouts were intended to take stress off the power grid but turned into outages thatin some parts of the statelasted several days, the report stated. In that short time, at least 210 deaths were attributed to the outage, which also caused an estimated $195 billion in economic damage. The third leg of the fatal trifecta is the ability of regions of the grid to support each other. For all its fragmented sources, utilities, and regulations, the North American power grid is interconnected in a way that allows one region to shift electricity to another region if one has an excess and the other a shortfall. Utilities routinely rely on this to balance supply and demand at any given moment. Increasingly, however, with excess reserves dwindling as coal plants are aggressively shut down across the United States, this ability to phone a friend is going away.Following Europe and California In many ways, Texas followed the lead of Europe and California in transitioning their grid to wind and solar energy, retiring coal plants and sometimes nuclear plants as well, to halt global warming and please anti-nuclear activists. Because wind and solar are weather-dependent, a dispatchable backup source is needed, and that source is typically natural gas. As Europe, California, and Texas have learned, this transition creates vulnerability compared to coal and nuclear plants, where fuel can be stored on-site. It has also led to sharply increasing prices for electricity, as dual systems of power generation need to be built, along with additional transmission infrastructure. According to a 2021 Princeton Study, relying on wind and solar to achieve net zero by 2050 would require Americas high-voltage transmission network to triple in size, at a cost of $2.4 trillion. In what appears to be a surrender, or at least a retreat, from the net-zero transition, some European countries, like Germany, are restarting their coal plants as wind and solar fail to meet demand, even at inflated prices. What we see in Europe from this misguided infatuation with renewables is a stark warning, and I think we can see the same thing in Californiaskyrocketing electricity prices and no significant reduction in CO2 to speak of, Mr. Bryce said. At the same time, the drive to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions has led to political and corporate campaigns to shift ever more products onto the electric grid. This includes such essentials as home heating, transportation, and cooking. Laws and regulations in Europe and the United States have sought to ban or phase out oil and gas heating in homes, along with gasoline-powered cars, trucks, and buses. The effect of this will be to make people more dependent on electricity while pushing up demand to levels that many say the grid cannot meet. The grid is already cracking under existing demand, Mr. Bryce said. Were seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, while these pressure groups are trying to put yet more demand on it. This is a date with disaster.Wind and Solar Devour Open Spaces Added to this is the insatiable hunger of the wind and solar industry for the consumption of land. According to a May report by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), reaching the goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050 would consume more than 250,000 square miles, or 160 million acres, of land. With current siting practices, an area the size of Texas is required to accommodate the wind and solar infrastructure we need to reach nationwide net-zero emissions by 2050, stated Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at TNC, a renewable energy advocate. Many energy experts and environmentalists are coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is the best choice to generate reliable, affordable energy, while cutting CO2 emissions. Despite headline nuclear catastrophes at plants in Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, many countries are building new plants or delaying closures of existing nuclear plants, considering it the cleanest and least environmentally harmful source of electricity. According to a report by the Nuclear Energy Institute, wind farms require up to 360 times as much land area to produce the same amount of electricity as a nuclear energy facility, and solar facilities require up to 75 times the land area. Compared to coal and natural gas plants, wind and solar consume at least 10 times as much land, according to the left-leaning Brookings Institution. In addition to a smaller footprint, nuclear power stations also typically do not require the construction of thousands of miles of new transmission lines to reach remote locations, where wind and solar facilities are typically built. With nuclear, Mr. Bryce said, we dont need to expand the grid; we can use the grid we have.Climate Activists Embrace Nuclear Even ardent supporters of green-new-deal initiatives are starting to accept that nuclear must be at least part of the plan. What were seeing out of Congress, and to some extent out of this White House, is more accommodation for nuclear energy, Mr. Bryce said. A 2022 report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reports that France, the EUs leading atomic state with nuclear weapons and fifty-six power reactors, is poised to launch a major reinvestment in nuclear power. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland are also preparing to build new nuclear reactors, the report states, while other European nationsAustria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and Portugalremain opposed to nuclear power. California regulators, meanwhile, opted in December 2023 to keep the states nuclear facility at Diablo Canyon open through at least 2030, having previously ordered its closure in 2025. This is a retreat for a state that has been plagued with rolling blackouts as it jumped headlong into a wind and solar future. If we are going to agree that climate change is an issue, with more [weather] extremes for longer, its total insanity to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather, Mr. Bryce said. We need weather-resilient, weather-resistant generation, not weather-dependent generation. With the Inflation Reduction Act and the investment tax credits, production tax credits, all of the financial incentives in the power-gen sector are to build more wind and solar, he said.

In that short time, at least 210 deaths were attributed to the outage, which also caused an estimated $195 billion in economic damage. The third leg of the fatal trifecta is the ability of regions of the grid to support each other. For all its fragmented sources, utilities, and regulations, the North American power grid is interconnected in a way that allows one region to shift electricity to another region if one has an excess and the other a shortfall. Utilities routinely rely on this to balance supply and demand at any given moment. Increasingly, however, with excess reserves dwindling as coal plants are aggressively shut down across the United States, this ability to phone a friend is going away.Following Europe and California In many ways, Texas followed the lead of Europe and California in transitioning their grid to wind and solar energy, retiring coal plants and sometimes nuclear plants as well, to halt global warming and please anti-nuclear activists. Because wind and solar are weather-dependent, a dispatchable backup source is needed, and that source is typically natural gas. As Europe, California, and Texas have learned, this transition creates vulnerability compared to coal and nuclear plants, where fuel can be stored on-site. It has also led to sharply increasing prices for electricity, as dual systems of power generation need to be built, along with additional transmission infrastructure. According to a 2021 Princeton Study, relying on wind and solar to achieve net zero by 2050 would require Americas high-voltage transmission network to triple in size, at a cost of $2.4 trillion. In what appears to be a surrender, or at least a retreat, from the net-zero transition, some European countries, like Germany, are restarting their coal plants as wind and solar fail to meet demand, even at inflated prices. What we see in Europe from this misguided infatuation with renewables is a stark warning, and I think we can see the same thing in Californiaskyrocketing electricity prices and no significant reduction in CO2 to speak of, Mr. Bryce said. At the same time, the drive to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions has led to political and corporate campaigns to shift ever more products onto the electric grid. This includes such essentials as home heating, transportation, and cooking. Laws and regulations in Europe and the United States have sought to ban or phase out oil and gas heating in homes, along with gasoline-powered cars, trucks, and buses. The effect of this will be to make people more dependent on electricity while pushing up demand to levels that many say the grid cannot meet. The grid is already cracking under existing demand, Mr. Bryce said. Were seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, while these pressure groups are trying to put yet more demand on it. This is a date with disaster.Wind and Solar Devour Open Spaces Added to this is the insatiable hunger of the wind and solar industry for the consumption of land. According to a May report by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), reaching the goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050 would consume more than 250,000 square miles, or 160 million acres, of land. With current siting practices, an area the size of Texas is required to accommodate the wind and solar infrastructure we need to reach nationwide net-zero emissions by 2050, stated Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at TNC, a renewable energy advocate. Many energy experts and environmentalists are coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is the best choice to generate reliable, affordable energy, while cutting CO2 emissions. Despite headline nuclear catastrophes at plants in Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, many countries are building new plants or delaying closures of existing nuclear plants, considering it the cleanest and least environmentally harmful source of electricity. According to a report by the Nuclear Energy Institute, wind farms require up to 360 times as much land area to produce the same amount of electricity as a nuclear energy facility, and solar facilities require up to 75 times the land area. Compared to coal and natural gas plants, wind and solar consume at least 10 times as much land, according to the left-leaning Brookings Institution. In addition to a smaller footprint, nuclear power stations also typically do not require the construction of thousands of miles of new transmission lines to reach remote locations, where wind and solar facilities are typically built. With nuclear, Mr. Bryce said, we dont need to expand the grid; we can use the grid we have.Climate Activists Embrace Nuclear Even ardent supporters of green-new-deal initiatives are starting to accept that nuclear must be at least part of the plan. What were seeing out of Congress, and to some extent out of this White House, is more accommodation for nuclear energy, Mr. Bryce said. A 2022 report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reports that France, the EUs leading atomic state with nuclear weapons and fifty-six power reactors, is poised to launch a major reinvestment in nuclear power. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland are also preparing to build new nuclear reactors, the report states, while other European nationsAustria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and Portugalremain opposed to nuclear power. California regulators, meanwhile, opted in December 2023 to keep the states nuclear facility at Diablo Canyon open through at least 2030, having previously ordered its closure in 2025. This is a retreat for a state that has been plagued with rolling blackouts as it jumped headlong into a wind and solar future. If we are going to agree that climate change is an issue, with more [weather] extremes for longer, its total insanity to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather, Mr. Bryce said. We need weather-resilient, weather-resistant generation, not weather-dependent generation. With the Inflation Reduction Act and the investment tax credits, production tax credits, all of the financial incentives in the power-gen sector are to build more wind and solar, he said. To me, that is just absolute crazy town. The documentary is available to watch for free on YouTube or at juicetheseries.com. Read more at:TheEpochTimes.comChris Keefer, president of Canadians for Nuclear Energy, concurred. The energy grid is a civilizational life support system, and without it, modern society collapses very quickly, he said. Mr. Keefer is one of the experts featured in energy analyst, author, and documentarian Robert Bryces new film, Juice: Power, Politics and the Grid. This five-part docuseries looks at how and why America is now fragilizing and destabilizing the engineering marvel that is the central pillar of our society. We are seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, Mr. Bryce told The Epoch Times. We wanted to get people and policy makers to understand that our most important energy network is being fragilized, and we ignore this danger at our peril. Steven Pinker, author and Harvard psychology professor, wrote in a review of the book that energy is our primary defense against poverty, disorder, hunger, and death. And yet, many nations in the West have engaged in a game of Russian roulette with their power grids, in an attempt to reduce global temperatures.  A Dire Warning The warnings dont just come from the analysts featured in the documentary; electricity regulators are becoming more vocal in sounding the alarm as well. In a May 2023 report, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), charged with overseeing grid reliability, stated that a majority of Americas grid is now at heightened risk levels for outages. This report is an especially dire warning that Americas ability to keep the lights on has been jeopardized, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association CEO Jim Matheson stated. It was the near-collapse of Texass power grid during winter storm Yuri in 2021 that compelled Mr. Bryce to make the documentary. He partnered with film director Tyson Culver, who along with Mr. Bryce, experienced the crisis first-hand while living in Austin. I didnt plan to make another documentary after we made our first film that we released in 2019, he said. I just thought, I cant do this; it costs too much and takes too long. But then we learned that the [Texas] grid nearly failed, and if it had failed, tens of thousands of people would have died, he said. And we realized, if this could happen in Texas, the energy capital of the world, then the electric grid is really being undermined. The North American electric grid is rapidly being transitioned from one in which coal had once dominated to one that is seeing an ever increasing share of wind, solar, and natural gas. In the process, Americas electric grid is changing from something that was once so reliable that consumers rarely thought about it, to one that increasingly features rolling blackouts and may, one day soon, be on the brink of long-term failure.The Fatal Trifecta The destabilization of the power grid is the result of what analyst and author Meredith Angwin deems the fatal trifecta. The Texas grid almost collapsed because of what I call the fatal trifecta, Ms. Angwin states. The first part of the fatal trifecta is over reliance on renewables, which go on and off when they want to. The second part is over reliance on natural gas, which is delivered just in time and can be interrupted just in time, she says. And the third part is relying on a neighbor to help. All of these factors came into play during Texas winter storm Yuri in 2021. Wind and solar facilities were unable to deliver in freezing weather, and supplies of natural gas were interrupted by freezing temperatures as well, just as people needed electricity to heat their homes. According to a Texas comptrollers report, natural gas supplied 51 percent of Texas electricity; wind 25 percent; and coal 13 percent. As these sources went offline, utilities frantically enacted blackouts to cut demand, fearing that a mismatch of supply and demand that lasted more than several minutes would cause long-term damage to the grids hardware. While Texas missed having a months-long outage of its electric grid by only a matter of minutes, the damage from short-term outages was severe. Rolling blackouts were intended to take stress off the power grid but turned into outages thatin some parts of the statelasted several days, the report stated.

To me, that is just absolute crazy town. The documentary is available to watch for free on YouTube or at juicetheseries.com.

Mr. Keefer is one of the experts featured in energy analyst, author, and documentarian Robert Bryces new film, Juice: Power, Politics and the Grid. This five-part docuseries looks at how and why America is now fragilizing and destabilizing the engineering marvel that is the central pillar of our society. We are seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, Mr. Bryce told The Epoch Times. We wanted to get people and policy makers to understand that our most important energy network is being fragilized, and we ignore this danger at our peril. Steven Pinker, author and Harvard psychology professor, wrote in a review of the book that energy is our primary defense against poverty, disorder, hunger, and death. And yet, many nations in the West have engaged in a game of Russian roulette with their power grids, in an attempt to reduce global temperatures.  A Dire Warning The warnings dont just come from the analysts featured in the documentary; electricity regulators are becoming more vocal in sounding the alarm as well. In a May 2023 report, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), charged with overseeing grid reliability, stated that a majority of Americas grid is now at heightened risk levels for outages. This report is an especially dire warning that Americas ability to keep the lights on has been jeopardized, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association CEO Jim Matheson stated. It was the near-collapse of Texass power grid during winter storm Yuri in 2021 that compelled Mr. Bryce to make the documentary. He partnered with film director Tyson Culver, who along with Mr. Bryce, experienced the crisis first-hand while living in Austin. I didnt plan to make another documentary after we made our first film that we released in 2019, he said. I just thought, I cant do this; it costs too much and takes too long. But then we learned that the [Texas] grid nearly failed, and if it had failed, tens of thousands of people would have died, he said. And we realized, if this could happen in Texas, the energy capital of the world, then the electric grid is really being undermined. The North American electric grid is rapidly being transitioned from one in which coal had once dominated to one that is seeing an ever increasing share of wind, solar, and natural gas. In the process, Americas electric grid is changing from something that was once so reliable that consumers rarely thought about it, to one that increasingly features rolling blackouts and may, one day soon, be on the brink of long-term failure.The Fatal Trifecta The destabilization of the power grid is the result of what analyst and author Meredith Angwin deems the fatal trifecta. The Texas grid almost collapsed because of what I call the fatal trifecta, Ms. Angwin states. The first part of the fatal trifecta is over reliance on renewables, which go on and off when they want to. The second part is over reliance on natural gas, which is delivered just in time and can be interrupted just in time, she says. And the third part is relying on a neighbor to help. All of these factors came into play during Texas winter storm Yuri in 2021. Wind and solar facilities were unable to deliver in freezing weather, and supplies of natural gas were interrupted by freezing temperatures as well, just as people needed electricity to heat their homes. According to a Texas comptrollers report, natural gas supplied 51 percent of Texas electricity; wind 25 percent; and coal 13 percent. As these sources went offline, utilities frantically enacted blackouts to cut demand, fearing that a mismatch of supply and demand that lasted more than several minutes would cause long-term damage to the grids hardware. While Texas missed having a months-long outage of its electric grid by only a matter of minutes, the damage from short-term outages was severe. Rolling blackouts were intended to take stress off the power grid but turned into outages thatin some parts of the statelasted several days, the report stated. In that short time, at least 210 deaths were attributed to the outage, which also caused an estimated $195 billion in economic damage. The third leg of the fatal trifecta is the ability of regions of the grid to support each other. For all its fragmented sources, utilities, and regulations, the North American power grid is interconnected in a way that allows one region to shift electricity to another region if one has an excess and the other a shortfall. Utilities routinely rely on this to balance supply and demand at any given moment. Increasingly, however, with excess reserves dwindling as coal plants are aggressively shut down across the United States, this ability to phone a friend is going away.Following Europe and California In many ways, Texas followed the lead of Europe and California in transitioning their grid to wind and solar energy, retiring coal plants and sometimes nuclear plants as well, to halt global warming and please anti-nuclear activists. Because wind and solar are weather-dependent, a dispatchable backup source is needed, and that source is typically natural gas. As Europe, California, and Texas have learned, this transition creates vulnerability compared to coal and nuclear plants, where fuel can be stored on-site. It has also led to sharply increasing prices for electricity, as dual systems of power generation need to be built, along with additional transmission infrastructure. According to a 2021 Princeton Study, relying on wind and solar to achieve net zero by 2050 would require Americas high-voltage transmission network to triple in size, at a cost of $2.4 trillion. In what appears to be a surrender, or at least a retreat, from the net-zero transition, some European countries, like Germany, are restarting their coal plants as wind and solar fail to meet demand, even at inflated prices. What we see in Europe from this misguided infatuation with renewables is a stark warning, and I think we can see the same thing in Californiaskyrocketing electricity prices and no significant reduction in CO2 to speak of, Mr. Bryce said. At the same time, the drive to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions has led to political and corporate campaigns to shift ever more products onto the electric grid. This includes such essentials as home heating, transportation, and cooking. Laws and regulations in Europe and the United States have sought to ban or phase out oil and gas heating in homes, along with gasoline-powered cars, trucks, and buses. The effect of this will be to make people more dependent on electricity while pushing up demand to levels that many say the grid cannot meet. The grid is already cracking under existing demand, Mr. Bryce said. Were seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, while these pressure groups are trying to put yet more demand on it. This is a date with disaster.Wind and Solar Devour Open Spaces Added to this is the insatiable hunger of the wind and solar industry for the consumption of land. According to a May report by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), reaching the goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050 would consume more than 250,000 square miles, or 160 million acres, of land. With current siting practices, an area the size of Texas is required to accommodate the wind and solar infrastructure we need to reach nationwide net-zero emissions by 2050, stated Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at TNC, a renewable energy advocate. Many energy experts and environmentalists are coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is the best choice to generate reliable, affordable energy, while cutting CO2 emissions. Despite headline nuclear catastrophes at plants in Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, many countries are building new plants or delaying closures of existing nuclear plants, considering it the cleanest and least environmentally harmful source of electricity. According to a report by the Nuclear Energy Institute, wind farms require up to 360 times as much land area to produce the same amount of electricity as a nuclear energy facility, and solar facilities require up to 75 times the land area. Compared to coal and natural gas plants, wind and solar consume at least 10 times as much land, according to the left-leaning Brookings Institution. In addition to a smaller footprint, nuclear power stations also typically do not require the construction of thousands of miles of new transmission lines to reach remote locations, where wind and solar facilities are typically built. With nuclear, Mr. Bryce said, we dont need to expand the grid; we can use the grid we have.Climate Activists Embrace Nuclear Even ardent supporters of green-new-deal initiatives are starting to accept that nuclear must be at least part of the plan. What were seeing out of Congress, and to some extent out of this White House, is more accommodation for nuclear energy, Mr. Bryce said. A 2022 report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reports that France, the EUs leading atomic state with nuclear weapons and fifty-six power reactors, is poised to launch a major reinvestment in nuclear power. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland are also preparing to build new nuclear reactors, the report states, while other European nationsAustria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and Portugalremain opposed to nuclear power. California regulators, meanwhile, opted in December 2023 to keep the states nuclear facility at Diablo Canyon open through at least 2030, having previously ordered its closure in 2025. This is a retreat for a state that has been plagued with rolling blackouts as it jumped headlong into a wind and solar future. If we are going to agree that climate change is an issue, with more [weather] extremes for longer, its total insanity to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather, Mr. Bryce said. We need weather-resilient, weather-resistant generation, not weather-dependent generation. With the Inflation Reduction Act and the investment tax credits, production tax credits, all of the financial incentives in the power-gen sector are to build more wind and solar, he said.

Were seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, while these pressure groups are trying to put yet more demand on it. This is a date with disaster.Wind and Solar Devour Open Spaces Added to this is the insatiable hunger of the wind and solar industry for the consumption of land. According to a May report by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), reaching the goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050 would consume more than 250,000 square miles, or 160 million acres, of land. With current siting practices, an area the size of Texas is required to accommodate the wind and solar infrastructure we need to reach nationwide net-zero emissions by 2050, stated Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at TNC, a renewable energy advocate. Many energy experts and environmentalists are coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is the best choice to generate reliable, affordable energy, while cutting CO2 emissions. Despite headline nuclear catastrophes at plants in Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, many countries are building new plants or delaying closures of existing nuclear plants, considering it the cleanest and least environmentally harmful source of electricity. According to a report by the Nuclear Energy Institute, wind farms require up to 360 times as much land area to produce the same amount of electricity as a nuclear energy facility, and solar facilities require up to 75 times the land area. Compared to coal and natural gas plants, wind and solar consume at least 10 times as much land, according to the left-leaning Brookings Institution. In addition to a smaller footprint, nuclear power stations also typically do not require the construction of thousands of miles of new transmission lines to reach remote locations, where wind and solar facilities are typically built. With nuclear, Mr. Bryce said, we dont need to expand the grid; we can use the grid we have.Climate Activists Embrace Nuclear Even ardent supporters of green-new-deal initiatives are starting to accept that nuclear must be at least part of the plan. What were seeing out of Congress, and to some extent out of this White House, is more accommodation for nuclear energy, Mr. Bryce said. A 2022 report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reports that France, the EUs leading atomic state with nuclear weapons and fifty-six power reactors, is poised to launch a major reinvestment in nuclear power. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland are also preparing to build new nuclear reactors, the report states, while other European nationsAustria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and Portugalremain opposed to nuclear power. California regulators, meanwhile, opted in December 2023 to keep the states nuclear facility at Diablo Canyon open through at least 2030, having previously ordered its closure in 2025. This is a retreat for a state that has been plagued with rolling blackouts as it jumped headlong into a wind and solar future. If we are going to agree that climate change is an issue, with more [weather] extremes for longer, its total insanity to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather, Mr. Bryce said. We need weather-resilient, weather-resistant generation, not weather-dependent generation. With the Inflation Reduction Act and the investment tax credits, production tax credits, all of the financial incentives in the power-gen sector are to build more wind and solar, he said. To me, that is just absolute crazy town. The documentary is available to watch for free on YouTube or at juicetheseries.com. Read more at:TheEpochTimes.comWe are seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, Mr. Bryce told The Epoch Times. We wanted to get people and policy makers to understand that our most important energy network is being fragilized, and we ignore this danger at our peril. Steven Pinker, author and Harvard psychology professor, wrote in a review of the book that energy is our primary defense against poverty, disorder, hunger, and death. And yet, many nations in the West have engaged in a game of Russian roulette with their power grids, in an attempt to reduce global temperatures.  A Dire Warning The warnings dont just come from the analysts featured in the documentary; electricity regulators are becoming more vocal in sounding the alarm as well. In a May 2023 report, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), charged with overseeing grid reliability, stated that a majority of Americas grid is now at heightened risk levels for outages. This report is an especially dire warning that Americas ability to keep the lights on has been jeopardized, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association CEO Jim Matheson stated. It was the near-collapse of Texass power grid during winter storm Yuri in 2021 that compelled Mr. Bryce to make the documentary. He partnered with film director Tyson Culver, who along with Mr. Bryce, experienced the crisis first-hand while living in Austin. I didnt plan to make another documentary after we made our first film that we released in 2019, he said. I just thought, I cant do this; it costs too much and takes too long. But then we learned that the [Texas] grid nearly failed, and if it had failed, tens of thousands of people would have died, he said. And we realized, if this could happen in Texas, the energy capital of the world, then the electric grid is really being undermined. The North American electric grid is rapidly being transitioned from one in which coal had once dominated to one that is seeing an ever increasing share of wind, solar, and natural gas. In the process, Americas electric grid is changing from something that was once so reliable that consumers rarely thought about it, to one that increasingly features rolling blackouts and may, one day soon, be on the brink of long-term failure.The Fatal Trifecta The destabilization of the power grid is the result of what analyst and author Meredith Angwin deems the fatal trifecta. The Texas grid almost collapsed because of what I call the fatal trifecta, Ms. Angwin states. The first part of the fatal trifecta is over reliance on renewables, which go on and off when they want to. The second part is over reliance on natural gas, which is delivered just in time and can be interrupted just in time, she says. And the third part is relying on a neighbor to help. All of these factors came into play during Texas winter storm Yuri in 2021. Wind and solar facilities were unable to deliver in freezing weather, and supplies of natural gas were interrupted by freezing temperatures as well, just as people needed electricity to heat their homes. According to a Texas comptrollers report, natural gas supplied 51 percent of Texas electricity; wind 25 percent; and coal 13 percent. As these sources went offline, utilities frantically enacted blackouts to cut demand, fearing that a mismatch of supply and demand that lasted more than several minutes would cause long-term damage to the grids hardware. While Texas missed having a months-long outage of its electric grid by only a matter of minutes, the damage from short-term outages was severe. Rolling blackouts were intended to take stress off the power grid but turned into outages thatin some parts of the statelasted several days, the report stated. In that short time, at least 210 deaths were attributed to the outage, which also caused an estimated $195 billion in economic damage. The third leg of the fatal trifecta is the ability of regions of the grid to support each other. For all its fragmented sources, utilities, and regulations, the North American power grid is interconnected in a way that allows one region to shift electricity to another region if one has an excess and the other a shortfall. Utilities routinely rely on this to balance supply and demand at any given moment. Increasingly, however, with excess reserves dwindling as coal plants are aggressively shut down across the United States, this ability to phone a friend is going away.Following Europe and California In many ways, Texas followed the lead of Europe and California in transitioning their grid to wind and solar energy, retiring coal plants and sometimes nuclear plants as well, to halt global warming and please anti-nuclear activists. Because wind and solar are weather-dependent, a dispatchable backup source is needed, and that source is typically natural gas. As Europe, California, and Texas have learned, this transition creates vulnerability compared to coal and nuclear plants, where fuel can be stored on-site. It has also led to sharply increasing prices for electricity, as dual systems of power generation need to be built, along with additional transmission infrastructure. According to a 2021 Princeton Study, relying on wind and solar to achieve net zero by 2050 would require Americas high-voltage transmission network to triple in size, at a cost of $2.4 trillion. In what appears to be a surrender, or at least a retreat, from the net-zero transition, some European countries, like Germany, are restarting their coal plants as wind and solar fail to meet demand, even at inflated prices. What we see in Europe from this misguided infatuation with renewables is a stark warning, and I think we can see the same thing in Californiaskyrocketing electricity prices and no significant reduction in CO2 to speak of, Mr. Bryce said. At the same time, the drive to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions has led to political and corporate campaigns to shift ever more products onto the electric grid. This includes such essentials as home heating, transportation, and cooking. Laws and regulations in Europe and the United States have sought to ban or phase out oil and gas heating in homes, along with gasoline-powered cars, trucks, and buses. The effect of this will be to make people more dependent on electricity while pushing up demand to levels that many say the grid cannot meet. The grid is already cracking under existing demand, Mr. Bryce said.

It has also led to sharply increasing prices for electricity, as dual systems of power generation need to be built, along with additional transmission infrastructure. According to a 2021 Princeton Study, relying on wind and solar to achieve net zero by 2050 would require Americas high-voltage transmission network to triple in size, at a cost of $2.4 trillion. In what appears to be a surrender, or at least a retreat, from the net-zero transition, some European countries, like Germany, are restarting their coal plants as wind and solar fail to meet demand, even at inflated prices. What we see in Europe from this misguided infatuation with renewables is a stark warning, and I think we can see the same thing in Californiaskyrocketing electricity prices and no significant reduction in CO2 to speak of, Mr. Bryce said. At the same time, the drive to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions has led to political and corporate campaigns to shift ever more products onto the electric grid. This includes such essentials as home heating, transportation, and cooking. Laws and regulations in Europe and the United States have sought to ban or phase out oil and gas heating in homes, along with gasoline-powered cars, trucks, and buses. The effect of this will be to make people more dependent on electricity while pushing up demand to levels that many say the grid cannot meet. The grid is already cracking under existing demand, Mr. Bryce said. Were seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, while these pressure groups are trying to put yet more demand on it. This is a date with disaster.Wind and Solar Devour Open Spaces Added to this is the insatiable hunger of the wind and solar industry for the consumption of land. According to a May report by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), reaching the goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050 would consume more than 250,000 square miles, or 160 million acres, of land. With current siting practices, an area the size of Texas is required to accommodate the wind and solar infrastructure we need to reach nationwide net-zero emissions by 2050, stated Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at TNC, a renewable energy advocate. Many energy experts and environmentalists are coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is the best choice to generate reliable, affordable energy, while cutting CO2 emissions. Despite headline nuclear catastrophes at plants in Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, many countries are building new plants or delaying closures of existing nuclear plants, considering it the cleanest and least environmentally harmful source of electricity. According to a report by the Nuclear Energy Institute, wind farms require up to 360 times as much land area to produce the same amount of electricity as a nuclear energy facility, and solar facilities require up to 75 times the land area. Compared to coal and natural gas plants, wind and solar consume at least 10 times as much land, according to the left-leaning Brookings Institution. In addition to a smaller footprint, nuclear power stations also typically do not require the construction of thousands of miles of new transmission lines to reach remote locations, where wind and solar facilities are typically built. With nuclear, Mr. Bryce said, we dont need to expand the grid; we can use the grid we have.Climate Activists Embrace Nuclear Even ardent supporters of green-new-deal initiatives are starting to accept that nuclear must be at least part of the plan. What were seeing out of Congress, and to some extent out of this White House, is more accommodation for nuclear energy, Mr. Bryce said. A 2022 report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reports that France, the EUs leading atomic state with nuclear weapons and fifty-six power reactors, is poised to launch a major reinvestment in nuclear power. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland are also preparing to build new nuclear reactors, the report states, while other European nationsAustria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and Portugalremain opposed to nuclear power. California regulators, meanwhile, opted in December 2023 to keep the states nuclear facility at Diablo Canyon open through at least 2030, having previously ordered its closure in 2025. This is a retreat for a state that has been plagued with rolling blackouts as it jumped headlong into a wind and solar future. If we are going to agree that climate change is an issue, with more [weather] extremes for longer, its total insanity to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather, Mr. Bryce said. We need weather-resilient, weather-resistant generation, not weather-dependent generation. With the Inflation Reduction Act and the investment tax credits, production tax credits, all of the financial incentives in the power-gen sector are to build more wind and solar, he said. To me, that is just absolute crazy town. The documentary is available to watch for free on YouTube or at juicetheseries.com.

A Dire Warning The warnings dont just come from the analysts featured in the documentary; electricity regulators are becoming more vocal in sounding the alarm as well. In a May 2023 report, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), charged with overseeing grid reliability, stated that a majority of Americas grid is now at heightened risk levels for outages. This report is an especially dire warning that Americas ability to keep the lights on has been jeopardized, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association CEO Jim Matheson stated. It was the near-collapse of Texass power grid during winter storm Yuri in 2021 that compelled Mr. Bryce to make the documentary. He partnered with film director Tyson Culver, who along with Mr. Bryce, experienced the crisis first-hand while living in Austin. I didnt plan to make another documentary after we made our first film that we released in 2019, he said. I just thought, I cant do this; it costs too much and takes too long. But then we learned that the [Texas] grid nearly failed, and if it had failed, tens of thousands of people would have died, he said. And we realized, if this could happen in Texas, the energy capital of the world, then the electric grid is really being undermined. The North American electric grid is rapidly being transitioned from one in which coal had once dominated to one that is seeing an ever increasing share of wind, solar, and natural gas. In the process, Americas electric grid is changing from something that was once so reliable that consumers rarely thought about it, to one that increasingly features rolling blackouts and may, one day soon, be on the brink of long-term failure.The Fatal Trifecta The destabilization of the power grid is the result of what analyst and author Meredith Angwin deems the fatal trifecta. The Texas grid almost collapsed because of what I call the fatal trifecta, Ms. Angwin states. The first part of the fatal trifecta is over reliance on renewables, which go on and off when they want to. The second part is over reliance on natural gas, which is delivered just in time and can be interrupted just in time, she says. And the third part is relying on a neighbor to help. All of these factors came into play during Texas winter storm Yuri in 2021. Wind and solar facilities were unable to deliver in freezing weather, and supplies of natural gas were interrupted by freezing temperatures as well, just as people needed electricity to heat their homes. According to a Texas comptrollers report, natural gas supplied 51 percent of Texas electricity; wind 25 percent; and coal 13 percent. As these sources went offline, utilities frantically enacted blackouts to cut demand, fearing that a mismatch of supply and demand that lasted more than several minutes would cause long-term damage to the grids hardware. While Texas missed having a months-long outage of its electric grid by only a matter of minutes, the damage from short-term outages was severe. Rolling blackouts were intended to take stress off the power grid but turned into outages thatin some parts of the statelasted several days, the report stated. In that short time, at least 210 deaths were attributed to the outage, which also caused an estimated $195 billion in economic damage. The third leg of the fatal trifecta is the ability of regions of the grid to support each other. For all its fragmented sources, utilities, and regulations, the North American power grid is interconnected in a way that allows one region to shift electricity to another region if one has an excess and the other a shortfall. Utilities routinely rely on this to balance supply and demand at any given moment. Increasingly, however, with excess reserves dwindling as coal plants are aggressively shut down across the United States, this ability to phone a friend is going away.Following Europe and California In many ways, Texas followed the lead of Europe and California in transitioning their grid to wind and solar energy, retiring coal plants and sometimes nuclear plants as well, to halt global warming and please anti-nuclear activists. Because wind and solar are weather-dependent, a dispatchable backup source is needed, and that source is typically natural gas.

Because wind and solar are weather-dependent, a dispatchable backup source is needed, and that source is typically natural gas. As Europe, California, and Texas have learned, this transition creates vulnerability compared to coal and nuclear plants, where fuel can be stored on-site. It has also led to sharply increasing prices for electricity, as dual systems of power generation need to be built, along with additional transmission infrastructure. According to a 2021 Princeton Study, relying on wind and solar to achieve net zero by 2050 would require Americas high-voltage transmission network to triple in size, at a cost of $2.4 trillion. In what appears to be a surrender, or at least a retreat, from the net-zero transition, some European countries, like Germany, are restarting their coal plants as wind and solar fail to meet demand, even at inflated prices. What we see in Europe from this misguided infatuation with renewables is a stark warning, and I think we can see the same thing in Californiaskyrocketing electricity prices and no significant reduction in CO2 to speak of, Mr. Bryce said. At the same time, the drive to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions has led to political and corporate campaigns to shift ever more products onto the electric grid. This includes such essentials as home heating, transportation, and cooking. Laws and regulations in Europe and the United States have sought to ban or phase out oil and gas heating in homes, along with gasoline-powered cars, trucks, and buses. The effect of this will be to make people more dependent on electricity while pushing up demand to levels that many say the grid cannot meet. The grid is already cracking under existing demand, Mr. Bryce said. Were seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, while these pressure groups are trying to put yet more demand on it. This is a date with disaster.Wind and Solar Devour Open Spaces Added to this is the insatiable hunger of the wind and solar industry for the consumption of land. According to a May report by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), reaching the goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050 would consume more than 250,000 square miles, or 160 million acres, of land. With current siting practices, an area the size of Texas is required to accommodate the wind and solar infrastructure we need to reach nationwide net-zero emissions by 2050, stated Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at TNC, a renewable energy advocate. Many energy experts and environmentalists are coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is the best choice to generate reliable, affordable energy, while cutting CO2 emissions. Despite headline nuclear catastrophes at plants in Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, many countries are building new plants or delaying closures of existing nuclear plants, considering it the cleanest and least environmentally harmful source of electricity. According to a report by the Nuclear Energy Institute, wind farms require up to 360 times as much land area to produce the same amount of electricity as a nuclear energy facility, and solar facilities require up to 75 times the land area. Compared to coal and natural gas plants, wind and solar consume at least 10 times as much land, according to the left-leaning Brookings Institution. In addition to a smaller footprint, nuclear power stations also typically do not require the construction of thousands of miles of new transmission lines to reach remote locations, where wind and solar facilities are typically built. With nuclear, Mr. Bryce said, we dont need to expand the grid; we can use the grid we have.Climate Activists Embrace Nuclear Even ardent supporters of green-new-deal initiatives are starting to accept that nuclear must be at least part of the plan. What were seeing out of Congress, and to some extent out of this White House, is more accommodation for nuclear energy, Mr. Bryce said. A 2022 report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reports that France, the EUs leading atomic state with nuclear weapons and fifty-six power reactors, is poised to launch a major reinvestment in nuclear power. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland are also preparing to build new nuclear reactors, the report states, while other European nationsAustria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and Portugalremain opposed to nuclear power. California regulators, meanwhile, opted in December 2023 to keep the states nuclear facility at Diablo Canyon open through at least 2030, having previously ordered its closure in 2025. This is a retreat for a state that has been plagued with rolling blackouts as it jumped headlong into a wind and solar future. If we are going to agree that climate change is an issue, with more [weather] extremes for longer, its total insanity to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather, Mr. Bryce said. We need weather-resilient, weather-resistant generation, not weather-dependent generation. With the Inflation Reduction Act and the investment tax credits, production tax credits, all of the financial incentives in the power-gen sector are to build more wind and solar, he said. To me, that is just absolute crazy town. The documentary is available to watch for free on YouTube or at juicetheseries.com. Read more at:TheEpochTimes.comThe warnings dont just come from the analysts featured in the documentary; electricity regulators are becoming more vocal in sounding the alarm as well. In a May 2023 report, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), charged with overseeing grid reliability, stated that a majority of Americas grid is now at heightened risk levels for outages. This report is an especially dire warning that Americas ability to keep the lights on has been jeopardized, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association CEO Jim Matheson stated. It was the near-collapse of Texass power grid during winter storm Yuri in 2021 that compelled Mr. Bryce to make the documentary. He partnered with film director Tyson Culver, who along with Mr. Bryce, experienced the crisis first-hand while living in Austin. I didnt plan to make another documentary after we made our first film that we released in 2019, he said. I just thought, I cant do this; it costs too much and takes too long. But then we learned that the [Texas] grid nearly failed, and if it had failed, tens of thousands of people would have died, he said. And we realized, if this could happen in Texas, the energy capital of the world, then the electric grid is really being undermined. The North American electric grid is rapidly being transitioned from one in which coal had once dominated to one that is seeing an ever increasing share of wind, solar, and natural gas. In the process, Americas electric grid is changing from something that was once so reliable that consumers rarely thought about it, to one that increasingly features rolling blackouts and may, one day soon, be on the brink of long-term failure.The Fatal Trifecta The destabilization of the power grid is the result of what analyst and author Meredith Angwin deems the fatal trifecta. The Texas grid almost collapsed because of what I call the fatal trifecta, Ms. Angwin states. The first part of the fatal trifecta is over reliance on renewables, which go on and off when they want to. The second part is over reliance on natural gas, which is delivered just in time and can be interrupted just in time, she says. And the third part is relying on a neighbor to help. All of these factors came into play during Texas winter storm Yuri in 2021. Wind and solar facilities were unable to deliver in freezing weather, and supplies of natural gas were interrupted by freezing temperatures as well, just as people needed electricity to heat their homes. According to a Texas comptrollers report, natural gas supplied 51 percent of Texas electricity; wind 25 percent; and coal 13 percent. As these sources went offline, utilities frantically enacted blackouts to cut demand, fearing that a mismatch of supply and demand that lasted more than several minutes would cause long-term damage to the grids hardware. While Texas missed having a months-long outage of its electric grid by only a matter of minutes, the damage from short-term outages was severe. Rolling blackouts were intended to take stress off the power grid but turned into outages thatin some parts of the statelasted several days, the report stated. In that short time, at least 210 deaths were attributed to the outage, which also caused an estimated $195 billion in economic damage. The third leg of the fatal trifecta is the ability of regions of the grid to support each other. For all its fragmented sources, utilities, and regulations, the North American power grid is interconnected in a way that allows one region to shift electricity to another region if one has an excess and the other a shortfall. Utilities routinely rely on this to balance supply and demand at any given moment.

According to a 2021 Princeton Study, relying on wind and solar to achieve net zero by 2050 would require Americas high-voltage transmission network to triple in size, at a cost of $2.4 trillion. In what appears to be a surrender, or at least a retreat, from the net-zero transition, some European countries, like Germany, are restarting their coal plants as wind and solar fail to meet demand, even at inflated prices. What we see in Europe from this misguided infatuation with renewables is a stark warning, and I think we can see the same thing in Californiaskyrocketing electricity prices and no significant reduction in CO2 to speak of, Mr. Bryce said. At the same time, the drive to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions has led to political and corporate campaigns to shift ever more products onto the electric grid. This includes such essentials as home heating, transportation, and cooking. Laws and regulations in Europe and the United States have sought to ban or phase out oil and gas heating in homes, along with gasoline-powered cars, trucks, and buses. The effect of this will be to make people more dependent on electricity while pushing up demand to levels that many say the grid cannot meet. The grid is already cracking under existing demand, Mr. Bryce said. Were seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, while these pressure groups are trying to put yet more demand on it. This is a date with disaster.Wind and Solar Devour Open Spaces Added to this is the insatiable hunger of the wind and solar industry for the consumption of land. According to a May report by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), reaching the goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050 would consume more than 250,000 square miles, or 160 million acres, of land. With current siting practices, an area the size of Texas is required to accommodate the wind and solar infrastructure we need to reach nationwide net-zero emissions by 2050, stated Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at TNC, a renewable energy advocate. Many energy experts and environmentalists are coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is the best choice to generate reliable, affordable energy, while cutting CO2 emissions. Despite headline nuclear catastrophes at plants in Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, many countries are building new plants or delaying closures of existing nuclear plants, considering it the cleanest and least environmentally harmful source of electricity. According to a report by the Nuclear Energy Institute, wind farms require up to 360 times as much land area to produce the same amount of electricity as a nuclear energy facility, and solar facilities require up to 75 times the land area. Compared to coal and natural gas plants, wind and solar consume at least 10 times as much land, according to the left-leaning Brookings Institution. In addition to a smaller footprint, nuclear power stations also typically do not require the construction of thousands of miles of new transmission lines to reach remote locations, where wind and solar facilities are typically built. With nuclear, Mr. Bryce said, we dont need to expand the grid; we can use the grid we have.Climate Activists Embrace Nuclear Even ardent supporters of green-new-deal initiatives are starting to accept that nuclear must be at least part of the plan. What were seeing out of Congress, and to some extent out of this White House, is more accommodation for nuclear energy, Mr. Bryce said. A 2022 report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reports that France, the EUs leading atomic state with nuclear weapons and fifty-six power reactors, is poised to launch a major reinvestment in nuclear power. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland are also preparing to build new nuclear reactors, the report states, while other European nationsAustria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and Portugalremain opposed to nuclear power. California regulators, meanwhile, opted in December 2023 to keep the states nuclear facility at Diablo Canyon open through at least 2030, having previously ordered its closure in 2025. This is a retreat for a state that has been plagued with rolling blackouts as it jumped headlong into a wind and solar future. If we are going to agree that climate change is an issue, with more [weather] extremes for longer, its total insanity to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather, Mr. Bryce said. We need weather-resilient, weather-resistant generation, not weather-dependent generation. With the Inflation Reduction Act and the investment tax credits, production tax credits, all of the financial incentives in the power-gen sector are to build more wind and solar, he said. To me, that is just absolute crazy town. The documentary is available to watch for free on YouTube or at juicetheseries.com. Read more at:TheEpochTimes.comThis report is an especially dire warning that Americas ability to keep the lights on has been jeopardized, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association CEO Jim Matheson stated. It was the near-collapse of Texass power grid during winter storm Yuri in 2021 that compelled Mr. Bryce to make the documentary. He partnered with film director Tyson Culver, who along with Mr. Bryce, experienced the crisis first-hand while living in Austin. I didnt plan to make another documentary after we made our first film that we released in 2019, he said. I just thought, I cant do this; it costs too much and takes too long. But then we learned that the [Texas] grid nearly failed, and if it had failed, tens of thousands of people would have died, he said. And we realized, if this could happen in Texas, the energy capital of the world, then the electric grid is really being undermined. The North American electric grid is rapidly being transitioned from one in which coal had once dominated to one that is seeing an ever increasing share of wind, solar, and natural gas. In the process, Americas electric grid is changing from something that was once so reliable that consumers rarely thought about it, to one that increasingly features rolling blackouts and may, one day soon, be on the brink of long-term failure.The Fatal Trifecta The destabilization of the power grid is the result of what analyst and author Meredith Angwin deems the fatal trifecta. The Texas grid almost collapsed because of what I call the fatal trifecta, Ms. Angwin states. The first part of the fatal trifecta is over reliance on renewables, which go on and off when they want to. The second part is over reliance on natural gas, which is delivered just in time and can be interrupted just in time, she says. And the third part is relying on a neighbor to help. All of these factors came into play during Texas winter storm Yuri in 2021. Wind and solar facilities were unable to deliver in freezing weather, and supplies of natural gas were interrupted by freezing temperatures as well, just as people needed electricity to heat their homes. According to a Texas comptrollers report, natural gas supplied 51 percent of Texas electricity; wind 25 percent; and coal 13 percent. As these sources went offline, utilities frantically enacted blackouts to cut demand, fearing that a mismatch of supply and demand that lasted more than several minutes would cause long-term damage to the grids hardware. While Texas missed having a months-long outage of its electric grid by only a matter of minutes, the damage from short-term outages was severe. Rolling blackouts were intended to take stress off the power grid but turned into outages thatin some parts of the statelasted several days, the report stated. In that short time, at least 210 deaths were attributed to the outage, which also caused an estimated $195 billion in economic damage. The third leg of the fatal trifecta is the ability of regions of the grid to support each other. For all its fragmented sources, utilities, and regulations, the North American power grid is interconnected in a way that allows one region to shift electricity to another region if one has an excess and the other a shortfall. Utilities routinely rely on this to balance supply and demand at any given moment. Increasingly, however, with excess reserves dwindling as coal plants are aggressively shut down across the United States, this ability to phone a friend is going away.Following Europe and California In many ways, Texas followed the lead of Europe and California in transitioning their grid to wind and solar energy, retiring coal plants and sometimes nuclear plants as well, to halt global warming and please anti-nuclear activists. Because wind and solar are weather-dependent, a dispatchable backup source is needed, and that source is typically natural gas.

With current siting practices, an area the size of Texas is required to accommodate the wind and solar infrastructure we need to reach nationwide net-zero emissions by 2050, stated Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at TNC, a renewable energy advocate. Many energy experts and environmentalists are coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is the best choice to generate reliable, affordable energy, while cutting CO2 emissions. Despite headline nuclear catastrophes at plants in Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, many countries are building new plants or delaying closures of existing nuclear plants, considering it the cleanest and least environmentally harmful source of electricity. According to a report by the Nuclear Energy Institute, wind farms require up to 360 times as much land area to produce the same amount of electricity as a nuclear energy facility, and solar facilities require up to 75 times the land area. Compared to coal and natural gas plants, wind and solar consume at least 10 times as much land, according to the left-leaning Brookings Institution. In addition to a smaller footprint, nuclear power stations also typically do not require the construction of thousands of miles of new transmission lines to reach remote locations, where wind and solar facilities are typically built. With nuclear, Mr. Bryce said, we dont need to expand the grid; we can use the grid we have.Climate Activists Embrace Nuclear Even ardent supporters of green-new-deal initiatives are starting to accept that nuclear must be at least part of the plan. What were seeing out of Congress, and to some extent out of this White House, is more accommodation for nuclear energy, Mr. Bryce said. A 2022 report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reports that France, the EUs leading atomic state with nuclear weapons and fifty-six power reactors, is poised to launch a major reinvestment in nuclear power. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland are also preparing to build new nuclear reactors, the report states, while other European nationsAustria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and Portugalremain opposed to nuclear power. California regulators, meanwhile, opted in December 2023 to keep the states nuclear facility at Diablo Canyon open through at least 2030, having previously ordered its closure in 2025. This is a retreat for a state that has been plagued with rolling blackouts as it jumped headlong into a wind and solar future. If we are going to agree that climate change is an issue, with more [weather] extremes for longer, its total insanity to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather, Mr. Bryce said. We need weather-resilient, weather-resistant generation, not weather-dependent generation. With the Inflation Reduction Act and the investment tax credits, production tax credits, all of the financial incentives in the power-gen sector are to build more wind and solar, he said. To me, that is just absolute crazy town. The documentary is available to watch for free on YouTube or at juicetheseries.com. Read more at:TheEpochTimes.comI didnt plan to make another documentary after we made our first film that we released in 2019, he said. I just thought, I cant do this; it costs too much and takes too long. But then we learned that the [Texas] grid nearly failed, and if it had failed, tens of thousands of people would have died, he said. And we realized, if this could happen in Texas, the energy capital of the world, then the electric grid is really being undermined. The North American electric grid is rapidly being transitioned from one in which coal had once dominated to one that is seeing an ever increasing share of wind, solar, and natural gas. In the process, Americas electric grid is changing from something that was once so reliable that consumers rarely thought about it, to one that increasingly features rolling blackouts and may, one day soon, be on the brink of long-term failure.The Fatal Trifecta The destabilization of the power grid is the result of what analyst and author Meredith Angwin deems the fatal trifecta. The Texas grid almost collapsed because of what I call the fatal trifecta, Ms. Angwin states. The first part of the fatal trifecta is over reliance on renewables, which go on and off when they want to. The second part is over reliance on natural gas, which is delivered just in time and can be interrupted just in time, she says. And the third part is relying on a neighbor to help. All of these factors came into play during Texas winter storm Yuri in 2021. Wind and solar facilities were unable to deliver in freezing weather, and supplies of natural gas were interrupted by freezing temperatures as well, just as people needed electricity to heat their homes. According to a Texas comptrollers report, natural gas supplied 51 percent of Texas electricity; wind 25 percent; and coal 13 percent. As these sources went offline, utilities frantically enacted blackouts to cut demand, fearing that a mismatch of supply and demand that lasted more than several minutes would cause long-term damage to the grids hardware. While Texas missed having a months-long outage of its electric grid by only a matter of minutes, the damage from short-term outages was severe. Rolling blackouts were intended to take stress off the power grid but turned into outages thatin some parts of the statelasted several days, the report stated. In that short time, at least 210 deaths were attributed to the outage, which also caused an estimated $195 billion in economic damage. The third leg of the fatal trifecta is the ability of regions of the grid to support each other. For all its fragmented sources, utilities, and regulations, the North American power grid is interconnected in a way that allows one region to shift electricity to another region if one has an excess and the other a shortfall. Utilities routinely rely on this to balance supply and demand at any given moment. Increasingly, however, with excess reserves dwindling as coal plants are aggressively shut down across the United States, this ability to phone a friend is going away.Following Europe and California In many ways, Texas followed the lead of Europe and California in transitioning their grid to wind and solar energy, retiring coal plants and sometimes nuclear plants as well, to halt global warming and please anti-nuclear activists. Because wind and solar are weather-dependent, a dispatchable backup source is needed, and that source is typically natural gas. As Europe, California, and Texas have learned, this transition creates vulnerability compared to coal and nuclear plants, where fuel can be stored on-site. It has also led to sharply increasing prices for electricity, as dual systems of power generation need to be built, along with additional transmission infrastructure. According to a 2021 Princeton Study, relying on wind and solar to achieve net zero by 2050 would require Americas high-voltage transmission network to triple in size, at a cost of $2.4 trillion. In what appears to be a surrender, or at least a retreat, from the net-zero transition, some European countries, like Germany, are restarting their coal plants as wind and solar fail to meet demand, even at inflated prices. What we see in Europe from this misguided infatuation with renewables is a stark warning, and I think we can see the same thing in Californiaskyrocketing electricity prices and no significant reduction in CO2 to speak of, Mr. Bryce said. At the same time, the drive to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions has led to political and corporate campaigns to shift ever more products onto the electric grid. This includes such essentials as home heating, transportation, and cooking. Laws and regulations in Europe and the United States have sought to ban or phase out oil and gas heating in homes, along with gasoline-powered cars, trucks, and buses. The effect of this will be to make people more dependent on electricity while pushing up demand to levels that many say the grid cannot meet. The grid is already cracking under existing demand, Mr. Bryce said. Were seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, while these pressure groups are trying to put yet more demand on it.

The second part is over reliance on natural gas, which is delivered just in time and can be interrupted just in time, she says. And the third part is relying on a neighbor to help. All of these factors came into play during Texas winter storm Yuri in 2021. Wind and solar facilities were unable to deliver in freezing weather, and supplies of natural gas were interrupted by freezing temperatures as well, just as people needed electricity to heat their homes. According to a Texas comptrollers report, natural gas supplied 51 percent of Texas electricity; wind 25 percent; and coal 13 percent. As these sources went offline, utilities frantically enacted blackouts to cut demand, fearing that a mismatch of supply and demand that lasted more than several minutes would cause long-term damage to the grids hardware. While Texas missed having a months-long outage of its electric grid by only a matter of minutes, the damage from short-term outages was severe. Rolling blackouts were intended to take stress off the power grid but turned into outages thatin some parts of the statelasted several days, the report stated. In that short time, at least 210 deaths were attributed to the outage, which also caused an estimated $195 billion in economic damage. The third leg of the fatal trifecta is the ability of regions of the grid to support each other. For all its fragmented sources, utilities, and regulations, the North American power grid is interconnected in a way that allows one region to shift electricity to another region if one has an excess and the other a shortfall. Utilities routinely rely on this to balance supply and demand at any given moment. Increasingly, however, with excess reserves dwindling as coal plants are aggressively shut down across the United States, this ability to phone a friend is going away.Following Europe and California In many ways, Texas followed the lead of Europe and California in transitioning their grid to wind and solar energy, retiring coal plants and sometimes nuclear plants as well, to halt global warming and please anti-nuclear activists. Because wind and solar are weather-dependent, a dispatchable backup source is needed, and that source is typically natural gas. As Europe, California, and Texas have learned, this transition creates vulnerability compared to coal and nuclear plants, where fuel can be stored on-site. It has also led to sharply increasing prices for electricity, as dual systems of power generation need to be built, along with additional transmission infrastructure. According to a 2021 Princeton Study, relying on wind and solar to achieve net zero by 2050 would require Americas high-voltage transmission network to triple in size, at a cost of $2.4 trillion. In what appears to be a surrender, or at least a retreat, from the net-zero transition, some European countries, like Germany, are restarting their coal plants as wind and solar fail to meet demand, even at inflated prices. What we see in Europe from this misguided infatuation with renewables is a stark warning, and I think we can see the same thing in Californiaskyrocketing electricity prices and no significant reduction in CO2 to speak of, Mr. Bryce said. At the same time, the drive to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions has led to political and corporate campaigns to shift ever more products onto the electric grid. This includes such essentials as home heating, transportation, and cooking. Laws and regulations in Europe and the United States have sought to ban or phase out oil and gas heating in homes, along with gasoline-powered cars, trucks, and buses. The effect of this will be to make people more dependent on electricity while pushing up demand to levels that many say the grid cannot meet. The grid is already cracking under existing demand, Mr. Bryce said. Were seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, while these pressure groups are trying to put yet more demand on it. This is a date with disaster.Wind and Solar Devour Open Spaces Added to this is the insatiable hunger of the wind and solar industry for the consumption of land. According to a May report by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), reaching the goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050 would consume more than 250,000 square miles, or 160 million acres, of land. With current siting practices, an area the size of Texas is required to accommodate the wind and solar infrastructure we need to reach nationwide net-zero emissions by 2050, stated Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at TNC, a renewable energy advocate. Many energy experts and environmentalists are coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is the best choice to generate reliable, affordable energy, while cutting CO2 emissions. Despite headline nuclear catastrophes at plants in Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, many countries are building new plants or delaying closures of existing nuclear plants, considering it the cleanest and least environmentally harmful source of electricity. According to a report by the Nuclear Energy Institute, wind farms require up to 360 times as much land area to produce the same amount of electricity as a nuclear energy facility, and solar facilities require up to 75 times the land area. Compared to coal and natural gas plants, wind and solar consume at least 10 times as much land, according to the left-leaning Brookings Institution. In addition to a smaller footprint, nuclear power stations also typically do not require the construction of thousands of miles of new transmission lines to reach remote locations, where wind and solar facilities are typically built. With nuclear, Mr. Bryce said, we dont need to expand the grid; we can use the grid we have.Climate Activists Embrace Nuclear Even ardent supporters of green-new-deal initiatives are starting to accept that nuclear must be at least part of the plan. What were seeing out of Congress, and to some extent out of this White House, is more accommodation for nuclear energy, Mr. Bryce said. A 2022 report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reports that France, the EUs leading atomic state with nuclear weapons and fifty-six power reactors, is poised to launch a major reinvestment in nuclear power. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland are also preparing to build new nuclear reactors, the report states, while other European nationsAustria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and Portugalremain opposed to nuclear power. California regulators, meanwhile, opted in December 2023 to keep the states nuclear facility at Diablo Canyon open through at least 2030, having previously ordered its closure in 2025. This is a retreat for a state that has been plagued with rolling blackouts as it jumped headlong into a wind and solar future. If we are going to agree that climate change is an issue, with more [weather] extremes for longer, its total insanity to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather, Mr. Bryce said. We need weather-resilient, weather-resistant generation, not weather-dependent generation. With the Inflation Reduction Act and the investment tax credits, production tax credits, all of the financial incentives in the power-gen sector are to build more wind and solar, he said.

With the Inflation Reduction Act and the investment tax credits, production tax credits, all of the financial incentives in the power-gen sector are to build more wind and solar, he said. To me, that is just absolute crazy town. The documentary is available to watch for free on YouTube or at juicetheseries.com. Read more at:TheEpochTimes.comThe second part is over reliance on natural gas, which is delivered just in time and can be interrupted just in time, she says. And the third part is relying on a neighbor to help. All of these factors came into play during Texas winter storm Yuri in 2021. Wind and solar facilities were unable to deliver in freezing weather, and supplies of natural gas were interrupted by freezing temperatures as well, just as people needed electricity to heat their homes. According to a Texas comptrollers report, natural gas supplied 51 percent of Texas electricity; wind 25 percent; and coal 13 percent. As these sources went offline, utilities frantically enacted blackouts to cut demand, fearing that a mismatch of supply and demand that lasted more than several minutes would cause long-term damage to the grids hardware. While Texas missed having a months-long outage of its electric grid by only a matter of minutes, the damage from short-term outages was severe. Rolling blackouts were intended to take stress off the power grid but turned into outages thatin some parts of the statelasted several days, the report stated. In that short time, at least 210 deaths were attributed to the outage, which also caused an estimated $195 billion in economic damage. The third leg of the fatal trifecta is the ability of regions of the grid to support each other. For all its fragmented sources, utilities, and regulations, the North American power grid is interconnected in a way that allows one region to shift electricity to another region if one has an excess and the other a shortfall. Utilities routinely rely on this to balance supply and demand at any given moment. Increasingly, however, with excess reserves dwindling as coal plants are aggressively shut down across the United States, this ability to phone a friend is going away.Following Europe and California In many ways, Texas followed the lead of Europe and California in transitioning their grid to wind and solar energy, retiring coal plants and sometimes nuclear plants as well, to halt global warming and please anti-nuclear activists. Because wind and solar are weather-dependent, a dispatchable backup source is needed, and that source is typically natural gas. As Europe, California, and Texas have learned, this transition creates vulnerability compared to coal and nuclear plants, where fuel can be stored on-site. It has also led to sharply increasing prices for electricity, as dual systems of power generation need to be built, along with additional transmission infrastructure. According to a 2021 Princeton Study, relying on wind and solar to achieve net zero by 2050 would require Americas high-voltage transmission network to triple in size, at a cost of $2.4 trillion. In what appears to be a surrender, or at least a retreat, from the net-zero transition, some European countries, like Germany, are restarting their coal plants as wind and solar fail to meet demand, even at inflated prices. What we see in Europe from this misguided infatuation with renewables is a stark warning, and I think we can see the same thing in Californiaskyrocketing electricity prices and no significant reduction in CO2 to speak of, Mr. Bryce said. At the same time, the drive to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions has led to political and corporate campaigns to shift ever more products onto the electric grid. This includes such essentials as home heating, transportation, and cooking. Laws and regulations in Europe and the United States have sought to ban or phase out oil and gas heating in homes, along with gasoline-powered cars, trucks, and buses. The effect of this will be to make people more dependent on electricity while pushing up demand to levels that many say the grid cannot meet. The grid is already cracking under existing demand, Mr. Bryce said. Were seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, while these pressure groups are trying to put yet more demand on it. This is a date with disaster.Wind and Solar Devour Open Spaces Added to this is the insatiable hunger of the wind and solar industry for the consumption of land. According to a May report by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), reaching the goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050 would consume more than 250,000 square miles, or 160 million acres, of land. With current siting practices, an area the size of Texas is required to accommodate the wind and solar infrastructure we need to reach nationwide net-zero emissions by 2050, stated Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at TNC, a renewable energy advocate. Many energy experts and environmentalists are coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is the best choice to generate reliable, affordable energy, while cutting CO2 emissions. Despite headline nuclear catastrophes at plants in Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, many countries are building new plants or delaying closures of existing nuclear plants, considering it the cleanest and least environmentally harmful source of electricity. According to a report by the Nuclear Energy Institute, wind farms require up to 360 times as much land area to produce the same amount of electricity as a nuclear energy facility, and solar facilities require up to 75 times the land area. Compared to coal and natural gas plants, wind and solar consume at least 10 times as much land, according to the left-leaning Brookings Institution. In addition to a smaller footprint, nuclear power stations also typically do not require the construction of thousands of miles of new transmission lines to reach remote locations, where wind and solar facilities are typically built. With nuclear, Mr. Bryce said, we dont need to expand the grid; we can use the grid we have.Climate Activists Embrace Nuclear Even ardent supporters of green-new-deal initiatives are starting to accept that nuclear must be at least part of the plan. What were seeing out of Congress, and to some extent out of this White House, is more accommodation for nuclear energy, Mr. Bryce said. A 2022 report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reports that France, the EUs leading atomic state with nuclear weapons and fifty-six power reactors, is poised to launch a major reinvestment in nuclear power. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland are also preparing to build new nuclear reactors, the report states, while other European nationsAustria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and Portugalremain opposed to nuclear power. California regulators, meanwhile, opted in December 2023 to keep the states nuclear facility at Diablo Canyon open through at least 2030, having previously ordered its closure in 2025. This is a retreat for a state that has been plagued with rolling blackouts as it jumped headlong into a wind and solar future.

Increasingly, however, with excess reserves dwindling as coal plants are aggressively shut down across the United States, this ability to phone a friend is going away.Following Europe and California In many ways, Texas followed the lead of Europe and California in transitioning their grid to wind and solar energy, retiring coal plants and sometimes nuclear plants as well, to halt global warming and please anti-nuclear activists. Because wind and solar are weather-dependent, a dispatchable backup source is needed, and that source is typically natural gas. As Europe, California, and Texas have learned, this transition creates vulnerability compared to coal and nuclear plants, where fuel can be stored on-site. It has also led to sharply increasing prices for electricity, as dual systems of power generation need to be built, along with additional transmission infrastructure. According to a 2021 Princeton Study, relying on wind and solar to achieve net zero by 2050 would require Americas high-voltage transmission network to triple in size, at a cost of $2.4 trillion. In what appears to be a surrender, or at least a retreat, from the net-zero transition, some European countries, like Germany, are restarting their coal plants as wind and solar fail to meet demand, even at inflated prices. What we see in Europe from this misguided infatuation with renewables is a stark warning, and I think we can see the same thing in Californiaskyrocketing electricity prices and no significant reduction in CO2 to speak of, Mr. Bryce said. At the same time, the drive to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions has led to political and corporate campaigns to shift ever more products onto the electric grid. This includes such essentials as home heating, transportation, and cooking. Laws and regulations in Europe and the United States have sought to ban or phase out oil and gas heating in homes, along with gasoline-powered cars, trucks, and buses. The effect of this will be to make people more dependent on electricity while pushing up demand to levels that many say the grid cannot meet. The grid is already cracking under existing demand, Mr. Bryce said. Were seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, while these pressure groups are trying to put yet more demand on it. This is a date with disaster.Wind and Solar Devour Open Spaces Added to this is the insatiable hunger of the wind and solar industry for the consumption of land. According to a May report by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), reaching the goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050 would consume more than 250,000 square miles, or 160 million acres, of land. With current siting practices, an area the size of Texas is required to accommodate the wind and solar infrastructure we need to reach nationwide net-zero emissions by 2050, stated Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at TNC, a renewable energy advocate. Many energy experts and environmentalists are coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is the best choice to generate reliable, affordable energy, while cutting CO2 emissions. Despite headline nuclear catastrophes at plants in Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, many countries are building new plants or delaying closures of existing nuclear plants, considering it the cleanest and least environmentally harmful source of electricity. According to a report by the Nuclear Energy Institute, wind farms require up to 360 times as much land area to produce the same amount of electricity as a nuclear energy facility, and solar facilities require up to 75 times the land area. Compared to coal and natural gas plants, wind and solar consume at least 10 times as much land, according to the left-leaning Brookings Institution. In addition to a smaller footprint, nuclear power stations also typically do not require the construction of thousands of miles of new transmission lines to reach remote locations, where wind and solar facilities are typically built. With nuclear, Mr. Bryce said, we dont need to expand the grid; we can use the grid we have.Climate Activists Embrace Nuclear Even ardent supporters of green-new-deal initiatives are starting to accept that nuclear must be at least part of the plan. What were seeing out of Congress, and to some extent out of this White House, is more accommodation for nuclear energy, Mr. Bryce said. A 2022 report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reports that France, the EUs leading atomic state with nuclear weapons and fifty-six power reactors, is poised to launch a major reinvestment in nuclear power. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland are also preparing to build new nuclear reactors, the report states, while other European nationsAustria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and Portugalremain opposed to nuclear power. California regulators, meanwhile, opted in December 2023 to keep the states nuclear facility at Diablo Canyon open through at least 2030, having previously ordered its closure in 2025. This is a retreat for a state that has been plagued with rolling blackouts as it jumped headlong into a wind and solar future. If we are going to agree that climate change is an issue, with more [weather] extremes for longer, its total insanity to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather, Mr. Bryce said. We need weather-resilient, weather-resistant generation, not weather-dependent generation. With the Inflation Reduction Act and the investment tax credits, production tax credits, all of the financial incentives in the power-gen sector are to build more wind and solar, he said.

In that short time, at least 210 deaths were attributed to the outage, which also caused an estimated $195 billion in economic damage.

To me, that is just absolute crazy town. The documentary is available to watch for free on YouTube or at juicetheseries.com. Read more at:TheEpochTimes.comThe third leg of the fatal trifecta is the ability of regions of the grid to support each other. For all its fragmented sources, utilities, and regulations, the North American power grid is interconnected in a way that allows one region to shift electricity to another region if one has an excess and the other a shortfall. Utilities routinely rely on this to balance supply and demand at any given moment. Increasingly, however, with excess reserves dwindling as coal plants are aggressively shut down across the United States, this ability to phone a friend is going away.Following Europe and California In many ways, Texas followed the lead of Europe and California in transitioning their grid to wind and solar energy, retiring coal plants and sometimes nuclear plants as well, to halt global warming and please anti-nuclear activists. Because wind and solar are weather-dependent, a dispatchable backup source is needed, and that source is typically natural gas. As Europe, California, and Texas have learned, this transition creates vulnerability compared to coal and nuclear plants, where fuel can be stored on-site. It has also led to sharply increasing prices for electricity, as dual systems of power generation need to be built, along with additional transmission infrastructure. According to a 2021 Princeton Study, relying on wind and solar to achieve net zero by 2050 would require Americas high-voltage transmission network to triple in size, at a cost of $2.4 trillion. In what appears to be a surrender, or at least a retreat, from the net-zero transition, some European countries, like Germany, are restarting their coal plants as wind and solar fail to meet demand, even at inflated prices. What we see in Europe from this misguided infatuation with renewables is a stark warning, and I think we can see the same thing in Californiaskyrocketing electricity prices and no significant reduction in CO2 to speak of, Mr. Bryce said. At the same time, the drive to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions has led to political and corporate campaigns to shift ever more products onto the electric grid. This includes such essentials as home heating, transportation, and cooking. Laws and regulations in Europe and the United States have sought to ban or phase out oil and gas heating in homes, along with gasoline-powered cars, trucks, and buses. The effect of this will be to make people more dependent on electricity while pushing up demand to levels that many say the grid cannot meet. The grid is already cracking under existing demand, Mr. Bryce said. Were seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, while these pressure groups are trying to put yet more demand on it. This is a date with disaster.Wind and Solar Devour Open Spaces Added to this is the insatiable hunger of the wind and solar industry for the consumption of land. According to a May report by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), reaching the goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050 would consume more than 250,000 square miles, or 160 million acres, of land. With current siting practices, an area the size of Texas is required to accommodate the wind and solar infrastructure we need to reach nationwide net-zero emissions by 2050, stated Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at TNC, a renewable energy advocate. Many energy experts and environmentalists are coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is the best choice to generate reliable, affordable energy, while cutting CO2 emissions. Despite headline nuclear catastrophes at plants in Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, many countries are building new plants or delaying closures of existing nuclear plants, considering it the cleanest and least environmentally harmful source of electricity. According to a report by the Nuclear Energy Institute, wind farms require up to 360 times as much land area to produce the same amount of electricity as a nuclear energy facility, and solar facilities require up to 75 times the land area. Compared to coal and natural gas plants, wind and solar consume at least 10 times as much land, according to the left-leaning Brookings Institution. In addition to a smaller footprint, nuclear power stations also typically do not require the construction of thousands of miles of new transmission lines to reach remote locations, where wind and solar facilities are typically built. With nuclear, Mr. Bryce said, we dont need to expand the grid; we can use the grid we have.Climate Activists Embrace Nuclear Even ardent supporters of green-new-deal initiatives are starting to accept that nuclear must be at least part of the plan. What were seeing out of Congress, and to some extent out of this White House, is more accommodation for nuclear energy, Mr. Bryce said. A 2022 report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reports that France, the EUs leading atomic state with nuclear weapons and fifty-six power reactors, is poised to launch a major reinvestment in nuclear power. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland are also preparing to build new nuclear reactors, the report states, while other European nationsAustria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and Portugalremain opposed to nuclear power. California regulators, meanwhile, opted in December 2023 to keep the states nuclear facility at Diablo Canyon open through at least 2030, having previously ordered its closure in 2025. This is a retreat for a state that has been plagued with rolling blackouts as it jumped headlong into a wind and solar future. If we are going to agree that climate change is an issue, with more [weather] extremes for longer, its total insanity to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather, Mr. Bryce said.

According to a May report by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), reaching the goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050 would consume more than 250,000 square miles, or 160 million acres, of land. With current siting practices, an area the size of Texas is required to accommodate the wind and solar infrastructure we need to reach nationwide net-zero emissions by 2050, stated Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at TNC, a renewable energy advocate. Many energy experts and environmentalists are coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is the best choice to generate reliable, affordable energy, while cutting CO2 emissions. Despite headline nuclear catastrophes at plants in Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, many countries are building new plants or delaying closures of existing nuclear plants, considering it the cleanest and least environmentally harmful source of electricity. According to a report by the Nuclear Energy Institute, wind farms require up to 360 times as much land area to produce the same amount of electricity as a nuclear energy facility, and solar facilities require up to 75 times the land area. Compared to coal and natural gas plants, wind and solar consume at least 10 times as much land, according to the left-leaning Brookings Institution. In addition to a smaller footprint, nuclear power stations also typically do not require the construction of thousands of miles of new transmission lines to reach remote locations, where wind and solar facilities are typically built. With nuclear, Mr. Bryce said, we dont need to expand the grid; we can use the grid we have.Climate Activists Embrace Nuclear Even ardent supporters of green-new-deal initiatives are starting to accept that nuclear must be at least part of the plan. What were seeing out of Congress, and to some extent out of this White House, is more accommodation for nuclear energy, Mr. Bryce said. A 2022 report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reports that France, the EUs leading atomic state with nuclear weapons and fifty-six power reactors, is poised to launch a major reinvestment in nuclear power. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland are also preparing to build new nuclear reactors, the report states, while other European nationsAustria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and Portugalremain opposed to nuclear power. California regulators, meanwhile, opted in December 2023 to keep the states nuclear facility at Diablo Canyon open through at least 2030, having previously ordered its closure in 2025. This is a retreat for a state that has been plagued with rolling blackouts as it jumped headlong into a wind and solar future. If we are going to agree that climate change is an issue, with more [weather] extremes for longer, its total insanity to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather, Mr. Bryce said. We need weather-resilient, weather-resistant generation, not weather-dependent generation. With the Inflation Reduction Act and the investment tax credits, production tax credits, all of the financial incentives in the power-gen sector are to build more wind and solar, he said.

Read more at:TheEpochTimes.comAs Europe, California, and Texas have learned, this transition creates vulnerability compared to coal and nuclear plants, where fuel can be stored on-site. It has also led to sharply increasing prices for electricity, as dual systems of power generation need to be built, along with additional transmission infrastructure. According to a 2021 Princeton Study, relying on wind and solar to achieve net zero by 2050 would require Americas high-voltage transmission network to triple in size, at a cost of $2.4 trillion. In what appears to be a surrender, or at least a retreat, from the net-zero transition, some European countries, like Germany, are restarting their coal plants as wind and solar fail to meet demand, even at inflated prices. What we see in Europe from this misguided infatuation with renewables is a stark warning, and I think we can see the same thing in Californiaskyrocketing electricity prices and no significant reduction in CO2 to speak of, Mr. Bryce said. At the same time, the drive to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions has led to political and corporate campaigns to shift ever more products onto the electric grid. This includes such essentials as home heating, transportation, and cooking. Laws and regulations in Europe and the United States have sought to ban or phase out oil and gas heating in homes, along with gasoline-powered cars, trucks, and buses. The effect of this will be to make people more dependent on electricity while pushing up demand to levels that many say the grid cannot meet.

Read more at:TheEpochTimes.comWhat we see in Europe from this misguided infatuation with renewables is a stark warning, and I think we can see the same thing in Californiaskyrocketing electricity prices and no significant reduction in CO2 to speak of, Mr. Bryce said. At the same time, the drive to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions has led to political and corporate campaigns to shift ever more products onto the electric grid. This includes such essentials as home heating, transportation, and cooking. Laws and regulations in Europe and the United States have sought to ban or phase out oil and gas heating in homes, along with gasoline-powered cars, trucks, and buses. The effect of this will be to make people more dependent on electricity while pushing up demand to levels that many say the grid cannot meet. The grid is already cracking under existing demand, Mr. Bryce said. Were seeing the grids reliability, resilience, and affordability all declining, while these pressure groups are trying to put yet more demand on it. This is a date with disaster.Wind and Solar Devour Open Spaces Added to this is the insatiable hunger of the wind and solar industry for the consumption of land. According to a May report by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), reaching the goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050 would consume more than 250,000 square miles, or 160 million acres, of land. With current siting practices, an area the size of Texas is required to accommodate the wind and solar infrastructure we need to reach nationwide net-zero emissions by 2050, stated Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at TNC, a renewable energy advocate. Many energy experts and environmentalists are coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is the best choice to generate reliable, affordable energy, while cutting CO2 emissions. Despite headline nuclear catastrophes at plants in Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, many countries are building new plants or delaying closures of existing nuclear plants, considering it the cleanest and least environmentally harmful source of electricity. According to a report by the Nuclear Energy Institute, wind farms require up to 360 times as much land area to produce the same amount of electricity as a nuclear energy facility, and solar facilities require up to 75 times the land area. Compared to coal and natural gas plants, wind and solar consume at least 10 times as much land, according to the left-leaning Brookings Institution. In addition to a smaller footprint, nuclear power stations also typically do not require the construction of thousands of miles of new transmission lines to reach remote locations, where wind and solar facilities are typically built. With nuclear, Mr. Bryce said, we dont need to expand the grid; we can use the grid we have.Climate Activists Embrace Nuclear Even ardent supporters of green-new-deal initiatives are starting to accept that nuclear must be at least part of the plan. What were seeing out of Congress, and to some extent out of this White House, is more accommodation for nuclear energy, Mr. Bryce said. A 2022 report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reports that France, the EUs leading atomic state with nuclear weapons and fifty-six power reactors, is poised to launch a major reinvestment in nuclear power. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland are also preparing to build new nuclear reactors, the report states, while other European nationsAustria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and Portugalremain opposed to nuclear power. California regulators, meanwhile, opted in December 2023 to keep the states nuclear facility at Diablo Canyon open through at least 2030, having previously ordered its closure in 2025. This is a retreat for a state that has been plagued with rolling blackouts as it jumped headlong into a wind and solar future. If we are going to agree that climate change is an issue, with more [weather] extremes for longer, its total insanity to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather, Mr. Bryce said. We need weather-resilient, weather-resistant generation, not weather-dependent generation.

Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland are also preparing to build new nuclear reactors, the report states, while other European nationsAustria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and Portugalremain opposed to nuclear power. California regulators, meanwhile, opted in December 2023 to keep the states nuclear facility at Diablo Canyon open through at least 2030, having previously ordered its closure in 2025. This is a retreat for a state that has been plagued with rolling blackouts as it jumped headlong into a wind and solar future. If we are going to agree that climate change is an issue, with more [weather] extremes for longer, its total insanity to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather, Mr. Bryce said. We need weather-resilient, weather-resistant generation, not weather-dependent generation. With the Inflation Reduction Act and the investment tax credits, production tax credits, all of the financial incentives in the power-gen sector are to build more wind and solar, he said. To me, that is just absolute crazy town. The documentary is available to watch for free on YouTube or at juicetheseries.com.

According to a May report by The Nature Conservancy (TNC), reaching the goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050 would consume more than 250,000 square miles, or 160 million acres, of land. With current siting practices, an area the size of Texas is required to accommodate the wind and solar infrastructure we need to reach nationwide net-zero emissions by 2050, stated Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist at TNC, a renewable energy advocate. Many energy experts and environmentalists are coming to the conclusion that nuclear energy is the best choice to generate reliable, affordable energy, while cutting CO2 emissions. Despite headline nuclear catastrophes at plants in Chernobyl, Three Mile Island, and Fukushima, many countries are building new plants or delaying closures of existing nuclear plants, considering it the cleanest and least environmentally harmful source of electricity. According to a report by the Nuclear Energy Institute, wind farms require up to 360 times as much land area to produce the same amount of electricity as a nuclear energy facility, and solar facilities require up to 75 times the land area. Compared to coal and natural gas plants, wind and solar consume at least 10 times as much land, according to the left-leaning Brookings Institution. In addition to a smaller footprint, nuclear power stations also typically do not require the construction of thousands of miles of new transmission lines to reach remote locations, where wind and solar facilities are typically built. With nuclear, Mr. Bryce said, we dont need to expand the grid; we can use the grid we have.Climate Activists Embrace Nuclear Even ardent supporters of green-new-deal initiatives are starting to accept that nuclear must be at least part of the plan.

A 2022 report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reports that France, the EUs leading atomic state with nuclear weapons and fifty-six power reactors, is poised to launch a major reinvestment in nuclear power. Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, and Poland are also preparing to build new nuclear reactors, the report states, while other European nationsAustria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and Portugalremain opposed to nuclear power. California regulators, meanwhile, opted in December 2023 to keep the states nuclear facility at Diablo Canyon open through at least 2030, having previously ordered its closure in 2025. This is a retreat for a state that has been plagued with rolling blackouts as it jumped headlong into a wind and solar future. If we are going to agree that climate change is an issue, with more [weather] extremes for longer, its total insanity to make our most important energy network dependent on the weather, Mr. Bryce said. We need weather-resilient, weather-resistant generation, not weather-dependent generation. With the Inflation Reduction Act and the investment tax credits, production tax credits, all of the financial incentives in the power-gen sector are to build more wind and solar, he said. To me, that is just absolute crazy town. The documentary is available to watch for free on YouTube or at juicetheseries.com.

risk,Its been close to 40 years since more than 100,000 people were evacuated from the area surrounding Chernobyl, and while that region is still considered inhospitable to human beings, the wolves that call it home have apparently developed a very intriguing trait.As you likely know, the meltdown that struck Chernobyl in 1986 is considered the worst incident in the history of nuclear energy due to the ramifications that couldve been much, much worse if the Soviets hadnt scrambled to address the deadly threats that stemmed from their own bureaucratic incompetence.The official death toll for the disaster sits at 30 due to people who perished after being exposed to lethal levels of radiation, although it is believed thousands more have or will eventually pass away from cancer that can be traced back to the fallout of what unfolded at the power plant.Ukraine is still home to a 1,000-square-mile area known as the Exclusion Zone that humans will be unable to inhabit for at least 3,000 years, and while there was a mass culling of animals in the region following the disaster, plenty of wildlife eventually made its way back into the impacted woodlands.That includes the mutant wolves that have attracted the interest of scientists whove spent decades conducting Chernobyl-adjacent researchincluding Cara Love, an evolutionary biologist at Princeton who was part of a team that managed to affix collars to the animals in 2014 to measure the levels of radiation theyre exposed to.According to Sky News, the data shows the wolves are subjected to 11.28 millirem of radiation on a daily basis, which the outlet notes is six times the level that is deemed safe for humans. You might assume that would result in a proliferation of cancer in the population, but it appears the animals have adapted to their hostile environment.Love said her research shows the wolves have not only developed altered immune systems similar to cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment but that blood tests she and her team have run have detected genetic mutations that appear to reduce the risk of cancer.Theres hope that theyll be able to use the evidence theyve obtained to further work concerning cancer prevention and treatment in humans, so its good to hear something positive could possibly come out of an otherwise disastrous situation.
risk,The Council of EU member states and the European Parliament agreed on Tuesday (6 February) to label nuclear power as a strategic technology for the EUs decarbonisation, following months of intense negotiations in Brussels over the Net-Zero Industry Act (NZIA).It came in response to the massive US green subsidy programme, the Inflation Reduction Act, as well as long-standing Chinese efforts to become global leaders in the manufacturing of clean technologies like batteries, heat pumps and solar panels.To this end, the NZIA aims to accelerate permitting procedures for industrial production sites involved in the manufacturing of components needed for renewable energy technologies, but also for nuclear power.Meeting in trilogues, negotiators from the Parliament, the Council, and the European Commission confirmed on Tuesday the strategic nature of projects relating to nuclear energy, which are included in a single list of net-zero technologies that will benefit from the NZIA.The text is a mix of the two mandates [adopted by the Council and Parliament], with a more comprehensive list than what was proposed by the member states, explained French MEP Christophe Grudler who took part in the talks for the centrist Renew Europe group in Parliament.The agreement encompasses tried and tested nuclear technologies as well as future third and fourth generation ones, i.e. small modular reactors (SMRs) and advanced nuclear reactors (AMRs). Their fuel cycles are also included in the text.While supporters of nuclear power in France have welcomed plans to scrap the two-tier approach to low-carbon technologies in the EUs draft Net-Zero Industry Act (NZIA), they also condemn the lower status granted to atomic energy as incoherent with the blocs wider decarbonisation goals.Concretely, this means that factories producing components for these technologies will benefit from simplified permitting procedures, with deadlines ranging from 18 to 12 months for bigger projects and 12 to nine months for smaller ones.The situation caused uproar among advocates of nuclear power after European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen publicly insisted that nuclear power was not strategic. In Paris, these were dismissed as unfortunate comments.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen outlined limits to EU backing for nuclear power under the blocs Net-Zero Industry Act, which seeks to support home-made production of clean technologies like batteries and solar panels.After much back and forth, nuclear power was finally included in the single list of 17 technologies proposed in November by the texts rapporteur, German MEP Christian Ehler (European Peoples Party  EPP).

Join Mobal today.Japan, inc. have shown for decades they will do things their way, meaning ways that continue to maximize their control and that profit them the most. The public continues to vote in politicians that support highly centralized energy systems, and apparently are willing to pay for those systems, whose costs increasingly rise. Nuclear power costs are too often hidden and/or fudged; the externalities of nuke power and burning huge amounts of fossil fuels are rarely revealed by those in power. Find ways to assist individual property owners to make their properties more energy efficient, and find ways to generate electricity that are renewable and do as little harm to the environment as possible.

Communities with nuclear power plants receive contributions from the power companies which are supposed to be used for various matters like evacuations. It is also used to improve the community.
risk,This cancer diagnosis led to a Shakespearean tragedy that not only brought about the end of the Iranian monarchy, but also directly led to the situation we are in today, where Iran has, for 45 years, been the arch-enemy of America.Since the Iran-backed group Hamas attacked Israel in October, both Israel and the United States have been striking other Iran-backed militant groups around the region, in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen.

Some high points have come in 2007, 2015, 2017, and 2024. Each time it has been absolutely critical to attack Iran at once. There could be no delay. Dominoes would fall. Terrorism would prevail. Credibility would be sqandered. And yet, each time, the threatened war has not been launched, and the world has gone on just the same.Weve seen a wide variety of excuses deployed over these years of unsuccessful propaganda for a war on Iran, including false claims about nuclear weapons, the pretense that attacking Iran would improve civil liberties within Iran, and shockingly honest commitments to gaining control of more oil with which to slowly destroy the habitability of the Earth. The push to attack Iran has been on for so long that entire categories of arguments for it (such as that the Iranians are fueling the Iraqi resistance) and demonized leaders of Iran have come and gone. The latest excuse is the killing of three members of the U.S. military.Ordinarily, killing people could be prosecuted as a crime. But thats tricky, because the United States government opposes and refuses to take part in international law, the U.S. troops had no legal justification for being where they were, and the violence across the region is being driven by U.S. support for enormous crimes by the Israeli government.More importantly, the advocates for war do not want to prosecute a crime, but to use a crime as an excuse to commit much larger crimes, on the familiar model of September 11, October 7, etc. The choice to escalate is not imposed on anyone; similar situations in the past have been used as excuses for war and also allowed to pass without the launching of any war.The U.S. government purports to believe that escalating wars will reduce wars, flying in the face of the overwhelming evidence of centuries, and to believe that there is no alternative, even though the demands of all sorts of warmakers across Western Asia are all the same and extremely easy to satisfy (and satisfying them has been ordered by the International Court of Justice): stop destroying Gaza and killing Gazans.The U.S. government distorts the notion of defense beyond all recognition by claiming that harm done to its imperial troops anywhere on Earth can justify a defensive war. This is highly convenient for war hawks in Washington, D.C., who have known for many years that getting U.S. troops killed can be a big propaganda boost for war madness  an idea eagerly encouraged today by U.S. media outlets that are always perfectly capable of demanding revenge while simulaneously calling it defense.This is what the empire of U.S. military bases looks like to Iran. Try to imagine if you lived there, what you would think of this. Who is threatening whom? Who is the greater danger to whom? The point is not that Iran should be free to attack the United States or anyone else because its military is smaller. The point is that doing so would be national suicide. It would also be something Iran has not done for centuries. But it would be typical U.S. behavior.The U.S. overthrew Irans democracy in 1953 and installed a brutal dictator / weapons customer. The U.S. gave Iran nuclear energy technology in the 1970s. Following the Iranian revolution, the United States aided Iraq in the 1980s in attacking Iran, providing Iraq with some of the weapons (including chemical weapons) that were used on Iranians and that would be used in 2002-2003 (when they no longer existed) as an excuse for attacking Iraq.The roots of a Washington push for a new war on Iran can be found in the 1992 Defense Planning Guidance, the 1996 paper called A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm, the 2000 Rebuilding Americas Defenses, and in a 2001 Pentagon memo described by Wesley Clark as listing these nations for attack: Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Lebanon, Syria, and Iran. Its worth noting that Bush Jr. overthrew Iraq, and Obama Libya, while the others remain works in progress. The arguments in these old forgotten memos were not what the war makers tell the public, but much closer to what they tell each other. The concerns were those of dominating regions rich in resources, intimidating others, and establishing bases from which to maintain control of puppet governments.In 2000, the CIA gave Iran nuclear bomb plans in an effort to frame it. This was reported by James Risen, and Jeffrey Sterling went to prison for allegedly being Risens source. But nobody involved in the scheme was ever punished in any way.In 2010, Tony Blair included Iran on a list of countries that he said Dick Cheney had aimed to overthrow. The line among the powerful in Washington in 2003 was that Iraq would be a cakewalk but that real men go to Tehran.For many years, the United States has labeled Iran an evil nation, attacked and destroyed the other non-nuclear nation on the list of evil nations, designated part of Irans military a terrorist organization, falsely accused Iran of crimes including the attacks of 9-11, murdered Iranian scientists, funded opposition groups in Iran (including some the U.S. also designates as terrorist), flew dronesover Iran, openly and illegally threatened to attack Iran, and built up military forces all around Irans borders, while imposing cruel sanctions on the country. The long history of the United States lying about Iranian nuclear weapons is chronicled by Gareth Porters book Manufactured Crisis.In 2007, we were told that Iran needed to be attacked urgently due to false claims about nuclear weapons. Even a National Intelligence Estimate in 2007 pushed back and admitted that Iran had no nuclear weapons program.In 2015, Republicans urged war justified by Irans nuclear weapons program, while Democrats successfully moved for passage of an agreement with Iran, also justified by Irans nuclear weapons program. The agreement was not a treaty, and President Trump would later throw it out. But the damage of both sides falsely claiming that Iran had a nuclear weapons program was done.Dick and Liz Cheneys book, Exceptional, tell us we must see a moral difference between an Iranian nuclear weapon and an American one. Must we, really? Either risks further proliferation, accidental use, use by a crazed leader, mass death and destruction, environmental disaster, retaliatory escalation, and apocalypse. One of those two nations has nuclear weapons, has used nuclear weapons, has provided the other with plans for nuclear weapons, has a policy of first-use of nuclear weapons, has leadership that sanctions the possession of nuclear weapons, and has frequently threated to use nuclear weapons. I dont think those facts would make a nuclear weapon in the hands of the other country the least bit moral, but also not the least bit more immoral. Lets focus on seeing an empiricaldifference between an Iranian nuclear weapon and an American one. One exists. The other doesnt.If youre wondering, U.S. presidents who have made specific public or secret nuclear threats to other nations, that we know of, as documented in Daniel Ellsbergs The Doomsday Machine, have included Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump, while others, including Barack Obama and Donald Trump have frequently said things like All options are on the table in relation to Iran or another country.Proponents of war or steps toward war (sanctions was a step toward the war on Iraq) say we urgently need a war on Iran now, but they have no argument for urgency, and theyve been making the same argument with ever less credibility for years.The Trump White House early on openly expressed a desire to claim that Iran had violated the 2015 nuclear agreement, but produced no evidence. It didnt matter. Trump tore up the agreement anyway and used his own shredding of the agreement as grounds for nuclear fearmongering about Iran.In 2017, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations claimed that Iranian weapons had been used in a war that the U.S.., Saudi Arabia, and allies were illegally and disastrously waging in Yemen. While thats a problem that should be corrected, it is hard to find a war anywhere on the planet without U.S. weapons in it. In fact, a report that made news the same day as the ambassadors claims, pointed to the long-known fact that many of the weapons used by ISIS had once belonged to the United States, many of them having been given by the U.S. to non-state fighters (aka terrorists) in Syria.Fighting wars and arming others to fight wars/terrorism is a justification for indictment and prosecution, but not for war, legally, morally, or practically. The United States fights and arms wars, and no one would be justified in attacking the United States.If Iran is guilty of a crime, and there is evidence to support that claim, the United States and the world should seek its prosecution. Instead, the United States is isolating itself by tearing down the rule of law.President Biden came into office with the possibility wide open to restore the Iran agreement and pursue a better course. He chose not to do so, and not to even try to do so. He waited for a less amendable government to take power in Iran, and then did seemingly everything he could to stir up hostitlities in the region. Now an agreement looks much more difficult to obtain.Of course the reason why real men go to Tehran is that Iran is not the impoverished disarmed nation that one might find in, say, Afghanistan or Iraq, or even the disarmed nation found in Libya in 2011. Iran is much bigger and much better armed. Whether the United States launches a major assault on Iran or Israel does, Iran will retaliate against U.S. troops and probably Israel and possibly the United States itself as well. And the United States will without any doubt re-retaliate for that. Iran cannot be unaware that the U.S. governments pressure on the Israeli government not to attack Iran consists of reassuring the Israelis that the United States will attack when needed, and does not include even threatening to stop funding Israels military or to stop vetoing measures of accountability for Israeli crimes at the United Nations.Of course, many in the U.S. government and military oppose attacking Iran, although key figures like Admiral William Fallon have been moved out of the way. Much of the Israeli military is opposed as well, not to mention the Israeli and U.S. people. But war is not clean or precise. If the people we allow to run our nations attack another, we are all put at risk.Most at risk, of course, are the people of Iran, people as peaceful as any other, or perhaps more so. As in any country, no matter what its government, the people of Iran are fundamentally good, decent, peaceful, just, and fundamentally like you and me. Ive met people from Iran. You may have met people from Iran. They look like this. Theyre not a different species. Theyre not evil. A surgical strike against a facility in their country would cause a great many of them to die very painful and horrible deaths. Even if you imagine that Iran would not retaliate for such attacks, this is what the attacks would in themselves consist of: mass murder.And what would that accomplish? It would unite the people of Iran and much of the world against the United States. It would justify in the eyes of much of the world an underground Iranian program to develop nuclear weapons, a program that probably does not exist at present, except to the extent that legal nuclear energy programs move a country closer to weapons development. The environmental damage would be tremendous, the precedent set incredibly dangerous, all talk of cutting the U.S. military budget would be buried in a wave of war frenzy, civil liberties and representative government would be flushed down the Potomac, a nuclear arms race would spread to additional countries, and any momentary sadistic glee would be outweighed by accelerating home foreclosures, mounting student debt, and accumulating layers of cultural stupidity.Strategically, legally, and morally weapons possession is not grounds for war, and neither is pursuit of weapons possession. And neither, I might add, with Iraq in mind, is theoretically possible pursuit of weapons never acted upon. Israel has nuclear weapons. The United States has more nuclear weapons than any other country but Russia (the two of them together have 90% of the worlds nukes). There can be no justification for attacking the United States, Israel, or any other country. The pretense that Iran has or will soon have nuclear weapons is, in any case, just a pretense, one that has been revived, debunked, and revived again like a zombie for years and years. But thats not the really absurd part of this false claim for something that amounts to no justification for war whatsoever.The really absurd part is that it was the United States in 1976 that pushed nuclear energy on Iran. In 2000 the CIA gave the Iranian government (slightly flawed) plans to build a nuclear bomb. In 2003, Iran proposed negotiations with the United States with everything on the table, including its nuclear technology, and the United States refused. Shortly thereafter, the United States started angling for a war. Meanwhile, U.S.-led sanctions prevent Iran from developing wind energy, while the Koch brothers are allowed to trade with Iran without penalty.Another area of ongoing lie debunking, one that almost exactly parallels the buildup to the 2003 attack on Iraq, is the relentless false claim, including by candidates in 2012 for U.S. President, that Iran has not allowed inspectors into its country or given them access to its sites. Iran had, in fact, prior to the agreement voluntarily accepted stricter standards than the IAEA requires. And of course a separate line of propaganda, albeit a contradictory one, holds that the IAEA has discovered a nuclear weapons program in Iran. Under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), Iran was not required to declare all of its installations, and early last decade it chose not to, as the United States violated that same treaty by blocking Germany, China, and others from providing nuclear energy equipment to Iran. While Iran remains in compliance with the NPT, India and Pakistan and Israel have not signed it and North Korea has withdrawn from it, while the United States and other nuclear powers continuously violate it by failing to reduce arms, by providing arms to other countries such as India, and by developing new nuclear weapons, not to mention keeping nuclear weapons in six European countries, providing Russia to put them into one European country as well.Are you ready for an even more absurd twist? This is on the same scale as Bushs comment about not really giving much thought to Osama bin Laden. Are you ready? The proponents of attacking Iran themselves admit that if Iran had nukes it would not use them. This is from the American Enterprise Institute:The biggest problem for the United States is not Iran getting a nuclear weapon and testing it, its Iran getting a nuclear weapon and not using it. Because the second that they have one and they dont do anything bad, all of the naysayers are going to come back and say, See, we told you Iran is a responsible power. We told you Iran wasnt getting nuclear weapons in order to use them immediately.  And they will eventually define Iran with nuclear weapons as not a problem.Is that clear? Iran using a nuclear weapon would be bad: environmental damage, loss of human life, hideous pain and suffering, yada, yada, yada. But what would be really bad would be Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon and doing what every other nation with them has done since Nagasaki: nothing. That would be really bad because it would damage an argument for war and make war more difficult, thus allowing Iran to run its country as it, rather than the United States, sees fit. Of course it might run it very badly (although the U.S. is hardly establishing a model for the world over here either), but it would run it without U.S. approval, and that would be worse than nuclear destruction.Inspections were allowed in Iraq and they worked. They found no weapons and there were no weapons. Inspections have been allowed in Iran and have worked. However, the IAEA has come under the corrupting influence of the U.S. government. And yet, the bluster from war proponents about IAEA claims over the years is not backed up by any actual claims from the IAEA. And what little material the IAEA has provided for the cause of war has been widely rejected when not being laughed at.Another year, another lie. No longer do we hear that North Korea is helping Iran build nukes. Lies about Iranian backing of Iraqi resisters have faded. (Didnt the United States back French resistance to Germans at one point?) Another recent concoction is the Iran did 911 lie. Revenge, like the rest of these attempted grounds for war, is actually not a legal or moral justification for war. But the 9/11 fiction has already been put to rest by the indespensable Gareth Porter, among others. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, which did play a role in 911 as well as in the Iraqi resistance, is being sold record quantities of that good old leading U.S. export of which were all so proud: weapons of mass destruction.Oh, I almost forgot another lie that hasnt quite entirely faded yet. Iran did not try to blow up a Saudi ambassador in Washington, D.C., an action which President Obama would have considered perfectly praiseworthy if the roles were reversed, but a lie that even Fox News had a hard time stomaching. And thats saying something.And then theres that old standby: Ahmadinejad said Israel should be wiped off the map. While this does not, perhaps, rise to the level of John McCain singing about bombing Iran or Bush and Obama swearing that all options including nuclear attack are on the table, it sounds extremely disturbing: wiped off the map! However, the translation is a bad one. A more accurate translation was the regime occupying Jerusalem must vanish from the page of time. The government of Israel, not the nation of Israel. Not even the government of Israel, but the current regime. Hell, Americans say that about their own regimes all the time, alternating every four to eight years depending on political party (some of us even say it all the time, without immunity for either party). Iran has made clear it would approve of a two-state solution if Palestinians approved of it. If the U.S. launched missile strikes every time somebody said something stupid, even if accurately translated, how safe would it be to live near Newt Gingrichs or Joe Bidens house?Luckily, war resisters have succeeded for so long (even while telling each other that they never succeed) that the war mongers dont remember who Ahmadinejad even was anymore, and all that demonization has gone to nought.The real danger may not actually be the lies. The Iraq experience has built up quite a mental resistance to these sorts of lies in many U.S. residents. The real danger may be the slow start of a war that gains momentum on its own without any formal announcement of its initiation. Israel and the United States have not just been talking tough or crazy. Theyve been murdering Iranians. And they seem to have no shame about it. The day after a Republican presidential primary debate at which candidates declared their desire to kill Iranians, the CIA apparently made certain the news was public that it was in fact already murdering Iranians, not to mention blowing up buildings. Some would say and have said that the war has already begun. Those who cannot see this because they do not want to see it will also miss the deadly humor in the United States asking Iran to return its brave drone.There was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war. The one that interested me the most was why dont we build  we in our shipyard  build four or five boats that look like Iranian PT boats. Put Navy seals on them with a lot of arms. And next time one of our boats goes to the Straits of Hormuz, start a shoot-up. Might cost some lives. And it was rejected because you cant have Americans killing Americans. Thats the kind of  thats the level of stuff were talking about. Provocation. But that was rejected.Now, Dick Cheney is not your typical American. Nobody in the U.S. government is your typical American. Your typical American is struggling, disapproves of the U.S. government, wishes billionaires were taxed, favors green energy and education and jobs over military boondoggles, thinks corporations should be barred from buying elections, and would not be inclined to apologize for getting shot in the face by the Vice President.Back in the 1930s, the Ludlow Amendment nearly made it a Constitutional requirement that the public vote in a referendum before the United States could go to war. President Franklin Roosevelt blocked that proposal. Yet the Constitution already required and still requires that Congress declare war before a war is fought. That has not been done in almost 80 years, while wars have raged on almost incessantly. In the past decade and right up through President Obamas signing of the outrageous National Defense Authorization Act on New Years Eve 2011-2012, the power to make war has been handed over to presidents. Here is one more reason to oppose a presidential war on Iran: once you allow presidents to make wars, you will never stop them. Another reason, in so far as anybody any longer gives a damn, is that war is a crime. Iran and the United States are parties to the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which bans war. One of those two nations is not complying.But we wont have a referendum. The U.S. House of Misrepresentatives wont step in. Only through widespread public pressure and nonviolent action will we intervene in this slow-motion catastrophe. This war, if it happens, will be fought by an institution called the United States Department of Defense, but it will endanger rather than defending us. As the war progresses, we will be told that the Iranian people want to be bombed for their own good, for freedom, for democracy. But nobody wants to be bombed for that. Iran does not want U.S.-style democracy. Even the United States does not want U.S.-style democracy. We will be told that those noble goals are guiding the actions of our brave troops and our brave drones on the battlefield. Yet there will be no battlefield. There will be no front lines. There will be no trenches. There will simply be cities and towns where people live, and where people die. There will be no victory. There will be no progress accomplished through a surge. On January 5, 2012, then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta was asked at a press conference about the failures in Iraq and Afghanistan, and he replied simply that those were successes. That is the kind of success that could be expected in Iran were Iran a destitute and disarmed state.Now we begin to understand the importance of all the media suppression, blackouts, and lies about the damage done to Iraq and Afghanistan. Now we understand why Obama and Panetta embraced the lies that launched the War on Iraq. The same lies must now be revived, as for every war ever fought, for a War on Iran. Heres a video explaining how this will work, even with some new twistsand lots of variations. The U.S. corporate media is part of the war machine.Planning war and funding war creates its own momentum. Sanctions become, as with Iraq, a stepping stone to war. Cutting off diplomacy leaves few options open. Electoral pissing contests take us allwhere most of us did not want to be.These are the bombs most likely to launch this ugly and quite possibly terminal chapter of human history. This animation shows clearly what they would do. For an even better presentation, pair that with this audio of a misinformed caller trying hopelessly to persuade George Galloway that we should attack Iran.On January 2, 2012, the New York Times reported concern that cuts to the U.S. military budget raised doubts as to whether the United States would be prepared for a grinding, lengthy ground war in Asia. At a Pentagon press conference on January 5, 2012, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff reassured the press corpse (sic) that major ground wars were very much an option and that wars of one sort or another were a certainty. President Obamas statement of military policy released at that press conference listed the missions of the U.S. military. First was fighting terrorism, next detering aggression, then projecting power despite anti-access/area denial challenges, then the good old WMDs, then conquering space and cyberspace, then nuclear weapons, and finally  after all that  there was mention of defending the Homeland Formerly Known As The United States.The cases of Iraq and Iran are not identical in every detail, of course. But in both cases we are dealing with concerted efforts to get us into wars, wars based, as all wars are based, on lies. We may need to revive this appeal to U.S. and Israeli forces!Disclaimer: The contents of this article are of sole responsibility of the author(s).

risk,Type One Energy Groupintends to locate to the Tennessee Valley Authoritys (TVA) Bull Run Fossil Plant in Clinton, TN, as the site for building Infinity One, the companys stellarator fusion prototype machine.Infinity One will allow Type One Energy to verify important design features of its high field stellarator fusion pilot plant, particularly those related to operating efficiency, reliability, maintainability, and affordability.Project Infinity, which includes the deployment of Infinity One and Type One Energys new headquarters in Tennessee, is expected to bolster economic growth and energy technological leadership in the region. Type One Energy will establish its headquarters in East Tennessee, creating over 300 high-paying jobs within the next five years.Type One EnergyCEO Christofer Mowrysaid in a press statement, Type One Energy is committed to making commercial fusion a reality over the next decade. Successful deployment of Infinity One in East Tennessee, with our partners TVA and ORNL, is a critical milestone in our FusionDirect commercialization program. It is also a watershed moment toward the commercialization of fusion, linking for the first time leaders in the technology, utility, and national laboratory sectors on an actual deployment project.TVA President and CEO Jeff Lyash said in a press statement, We appreciate this partnership between Type One Energy, ORNL, our local power companies and elected and economic development officials as we work together to identify energy technologies for the future.Oak Ridge National Laboratory Director Stephen Streiffer said in the same press statement, Its exciting to see a project in Oak Ridge with such great potential to advance fusion energy. We look forward to applying our institutional expertise and capabilities in working with Type One Energy on the engineering challenges they will be tackling at this new test facility.Type One was selected to participate in DOEs Milestone Based Fusion Development Program to develop fusion pilot plant designs and resolve related scientific and technological challenges within five to 10 years. The DOE announced awards totaling $46 million for an initial 18 months of work on May 31, 2023.ARPA-Es description of Type Ones recent Breakthroughs Enabling Thermonuclear-Fusion Energy (BETHE) project notes; Stellarators have been expensive and time consuming to build. Their large and complex electromagnets need to be shaped, supported, and positioned with precision. Type One says in its website it has planned a path to commercialization it calls the FusionDirect technology program. The next step is Starblazer which is a high-field, turbulence-optimized stellarator the company is developing as a commercial fusion pilot plant design.In parallel with Starblazer, Type One reports it will develop a risk-reduction platform over the next several years as a testbed to validate pilot plant engineering design choices and confirm its stellarator plasma physics models and simulations.On March 29, 2023, Type One Energy announced the closure of an over-subscribed seed funding round of $29M. This move marked the beginning of the firms FusionDirect program, which it says is devised to fast-track fusion energy generation in the short-term.According to the US Department of Energy,Stellarators have several advantagesover tokamaks, the other main technology that scientists are exploring for fusion power. Stellarators require less injected power to sustain the plasma, have greater design flexibility, and allow for simplification of some aspects of plasma control. However, DOE notes that these benefits come at the cost of increased complexity, especially for the magnetic field coils.Because confinement of the plasma in a stellarator is driven solely by the external magnets, modifying the shape and strength of their fields has a major impact on performance. To tailor a three-dimensional magnetic field with the right shape to achieve quasi-symmetry requires extensive calculations. Advances in computer modeling code and high-performance computing has provided this capability.The stellarator concept was invented by Lyman Spitzer at Princeton University in 1951. Much of the early development of stellarators in the 1950s occurred at a laboratory that is now DOEs Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory.Stellarators use external coils to generate a twisting magnetic field to control the plasma instead of inducing electric currents inside the plasma like a tokamak. Making stellarator coils is a challenge because it requires manufacturers to construct large bore wire coils with millimeter precision.(NucNet) A team from Princeton University has worked out a way to use an AI model to predict and prevent instabilities with plasma during fusion reactions. The researchers demonstrated their model could forecast potential plasma instabilities known as tearing mode instabilities up to 300 milliseconds in advance.Image: US Department of Energy Supercomputer simulation of plasma turbulencein a spherical tokamak.  Image courtesy of Walter Guttenfelder, Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and  Filippo Scotti, Lawrence Livermore National LaboratoryWhile 300 milliseconds leaves no more than enough time for a slow blink in humans, it was plenty of time for the AI controller to change certain operating parameters to avoid what would have developed into a tear within the plasmas magnetic field lines, upsetting its equilibrium and opening the door for a reaction-ending escape.The team said the research opens the door for more dynamic control of a fusion reaction than current approaches, and it provides a foundation for using artificial intelligence to solve a broad range of plasma instabilities, which have long been obstacles to achieving a sustained fusion reaction. The team published their findings inNatureon February 21, 2024.(Abstract summary below)Previous studies have generally focused on either suppressing or mitigating the effects of these tearing instabilities after they occur in the plasma, said first authorJaemin Seo, an assistant professor of physics at Chung-Ang University in South Korea who performed much of the work while a postdoctoral researcher in Kolemens group. But our approach allows us to predict and avoid those instabilities before they ever appear.  Avoiding Fusion Plasma Tearing Instability with Deep Reinforcement Learning  NatureNature Abstract (summary) For stable and efficient fusion energy production using a tokamak reactor, it is essential to maintain a high-pressure hydrogenic plasma without plasma disruption. Therefore, it is necessary to actively control the tokamak based on the observed plasma state, to maneuver high-pressure plasma while avoiding tearing instability, the leading cause of disruptions.This presents an obstacle-avoidance problem for which artificial intelligence based on reinforcement learning has recently shown remarkable performance1,2,3,4. However, the obstacle here, the tearing instability, is difficult to forecast and is highly prone to terminating plasma operations, especially in the ITER baseline scenario.Previously, we developed a multimodal dynamic model that estimates the likelihood of future tearing instability based on signals from multiple diagnostics and actuators. Here we harness this dynamic model as a training environment for reinforcement-learning artificial intelligence, facilitating automated instability prevention.We demonstrate artificial intelligence control to lower the possibility of disruptive tearing instabilities in DIII-D6, the largest magnetic fusion facility in the United States. The controller maintained the tearing likelihood under a given threshold, even under relatively unfavorable conditions of low safety factor and low torque.In particular, it allowed the plasma to actively track the stable path within the time-varying operational space while maintaining H-mode performance, which was challenging with traditional preprogrammed control. This controller paves the path to developing stable high-performance operational scenarios for future use in ITER.(News Release) The IAEA has designated theCenter for Science of Information at Purdue Universityas the first IAEA Collaborating Center to support the Agencys activities on artificial intelligence (AI) for nuclear power applications, including reactor design, plant operations, and training and education.Thanks to rapid progress in computational resources and data analysis tools, the nuclear industry has already started to benefit from AI, including with machine learning techniques that can streamline nuclear power plant operations and maintenance. AI is also supporting the development of advanced nuclear power technologies such as small modular reactors (SMRs).With more and more countries looking to nuclear energy to address climate change and sustainable development, this Collaborating Centre will provide much needed support for our Member States in using AI to advance the innovation driving the global nuclear sector, saidMikhail Chudakov, IAEA Deputy Director General and Head of the Department of Nuclear Energy.This Collaborating Centre will help build confidence in AI applications for high consequence systems, such as nuclear reactors. Without reliable quantification, the nuclear communitys ability to realize the potential of AI will be diminished and this will negatively impact its ability to remain competitive in the energy market, saidHany Abdel-Khalik, Professor of Nuclear Engineering at the Center for Science of Information, which advances information theory through collaborative research and teaching.The five-year Collaborating Center agreement will support IAEA programmatic activities and knowledge sharing on advancements and innovation in AI for nuclear power. This includes Agency initiatives on benchmark exercises for developing confidence and community-wide acceptance of Al technology for nuclear power, establishing a benchmarking hub for coordination and data management, as well as other activities relevant to the development and assessment of Al technologies in collaboration with IAEA Member States.AI offers the potential to optimize numerous processes within nuclear power plants. It could be used to bolster efficiency and ensure a steady electricity supply by adjusting power generation based on real-time data, including consumer demand, weather and equipment performance. Automation using robotics and AI systems could handle routine tasks, reducing the need for human input. AI could also improve fuel efficiency and maximize the energy output of reactors.The Collaborating Center agreement is part of recent IAEA efforts to strengthen support to countries interested in using AI for nuclear science and technology. The agreement comes after the Agency recently designated the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Plasma Science and Fusion Center as the first Collaborating Centre focused on accelerating fusion research, with an emphasis on AI applications to advance the IAEAs AI for Fusion initiative.The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) and Kyoto Fusioneering Ltd, a Japanese privately funded fusion technology company, have signed a Communication Framework Agreement to foster partnership on the exchange of knowledge and skills.The agreement enables the collaboration on the development of technology pertaining to tritium breeding blanket design and sets the stage for future joint initiatives, including areas such as tritium fuel cycle, remote handling, and power conversion (thermal cycle) technologies. A breeding blanket is a component to be used in future fusion machines. It is mainly used for producing tritium, which is one of the fuels of fusion reactions. The agreement between the two parties aims to advance blanket technology from its conceptual stage towards commercialization.One of Kyoto Fusioneerings recent contracts with UKAEA involved the development of gyrotron technology for UKAEAs fusion machine, MAST-U, sited at Culham Campus. Gyrotrons can provide high-power microwaves for amplifying fusion reactions. The outcomes of this project intend to provide insights and inform the early designs of STEP, the UKs prototype powerplant to be built at West Burton in Nottinghamshire.When a mix of two forms of hydrogen (deuterium and tritium) is heated to form a controlled plasma at extreme temperatures  10 times hotter than the core of the Sun  they fuse together to create helium and release energy which can be harnessed to produce electricity. There is more than one way of achieving this. UKAEAs approach is to hold this hot plasma using strong magnets in a ring-shaped machine called a tokamak, and then to harness this heat to produce electricity in a similar way to existing power stations.United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) is the UKs national organisation responsible for the research and delivery of sustainable fusion energy. It is an executive non-departmental public body, sponsored by the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero.UKAEA is implementing the UKs 650 million Fusion Futures Programme, the UKs alternative program to associating to Euratom R&T, to support the UK Fusion Strategy. The Program entails establishing new facilities at UKAEAs Culham Campus in Oxfordshire to facilitate the advancement of new technologies and expand fusion fuel cycle capabilities.Additionally, a fusion skills package will be introduced focusing on nurturing expertise across a spectrum of disciplines and levels. In 2021, UKAEA opened its Fusion Technology Facility near Rotherham in South Yorkshire, to develop and test materials and components for future fusion powerplants.Kyoto Fusioneering is a privately funded technology start-up founded in 2019 in Kyoto, with its headquarters in Tokyo, Japan. Building upon decades of research at Kyoto University, the company is focused on developing advanced technologies for commercial fusion reactors, including gyrotron systems, tritium fuel cycle technologies, and breeding blankets for tritium production and power generation.If you have an experience or insight to share or have learned something from a conference or seminar, your peers and colleagues on Energy Central want to hear about it.

risk,If Bill Gates could ask someone who traveled to the year 2100 anything about the future, he wouldnt enquire about the future of his bloodline or whether he managed to give away virtually all of his $124 billion fortune before his passing. Instead, the Microsoft founder would want to know whether AI eventually doomed or helped humanity.For me looking into the future, what I want to see is a world where everyone is living a comfortable life, Ritchie said, adding that it would signal whether society has managed to tackle the environmental problems it faces.Shes got a point: Scientists have warned that as carbon pollution heats the planet to ever more dangerous levels, it could trigger devastating domino effects if left unchecked including the loss of whole ecosystems, mass displacement and financial collapse.My assumption would be that climate change hadnt had extremely devastating impacts, where agriculture was ruined and health outcomes were really poor, and people were plunged into poverty, Ritchie said.Since then, the seventh richest person on the planet has maintained that he is glass half-full when it comes to preventing the worst of climate changes devastating impacts because there are already many very promising innovations out thereand AI will only speed up that progress, in his eyes.FORTUNE is a trademark of Fortune Media IP Limited, registered in the U.S. and other countries.

risk,- ASPI and QLE continue to work with potential customers to help resolve the current nuclear fuel supply chain issues. At current prices, ASPI and QLE has customer interest in over $30 billion of HALEU.WASHINGTON, Feb.  16, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ASP Isotopes Inc. NASDAQ: ASPI ("ASP Isotopes or ASPI or the Company), an advanced materials company dedicated to the development of technology and processes for the production of isotopes for use in multiple industries, announced today an update on its previously disclosed intention to spin-out its wholly owned subsidiary, Quantum Leap Energy LLC (QLE), as a separate public company. ASPI is planning to list QLE on a national exchange and distribute a portion of QLEs common equity to ASPIs stockholders as of a future record date, anticipated to be completed by year-end, in each case subject to obtaining applicable approvals and consents and complying with applicable rules and regulations and public market trading and listing requirements.The regulatory landscape and supply chain for nuclear fuel production differs significantly from that of medical isotopes, hence ASPI and QLE have different business models and we believe that both companies would benefit if QLE is independently managed and financed from ASPI.In connection with the anticipated spin-out, ASPI has entered into a number of agreements with QLE, including a License Agreement, pursuant to which QLE has licensed from ASPI the rights to produce enriched Uranium 235 and Lithium 6 in exchange for a perpetual royalty in the amount of 10% of all future QLE revenues, and an EPC Services Framework Agreement, pursuant to which the parties have agreed ASPI will provide services for the engineering, procurement and construction of one or more turnkey Uranium-235 and Lithium-6 enrichment facilities in locations to be identified by QLE and owned or leased by QLE, and commissioning, start-up and test services for each such facility, subject to the receipt of all applicable regulatory approvals, permits, licenses, authorizations, registrations, certificates, consents, orders, variances and similar rights.In addition, ASPI has assigned to QLE the two MOUs with U.S.-based small modular reactor companies for the use of Quantum Enrichment for the production of High-Assay Low Enriched Uranium (HALEU), which were entered into during 2023. The MOUs provide for substantial financial support for the development of HALEU production facilities that should be capable of supplying metric ton quantities of HALEU by 2027. The Companys discussions with potential customers in both the United States and international regions indicate a potential demand for over $30 billion(1) of HALEU at recent market prices by 2037. The Company has initiated discussions with multiple governments regarding the location of their first nuclear fuel facility.ASP Isotopes recently started the construction of the first Quantum Enrichment isotope facility, which is expected to enrich kilogram quantities of ytterbium-176 and nickel-64, two isotopes that are used in the medical industry and are in short supply. This first plant, which is in South Africa, is expected to be completed during 2025 and management believes that the thermodynamic similarities between ytterbium, nickel, lithium, and uranium will mean that the successful construction of this facility would significantly reduce the time required to construct a HALEU facility.Nuclear fuel has one of the most severely compromised supply chains of any material in the world. We believe that in order for long-term climate goals to be achieved, an alternative supplier of fuel is needed, said Paul Mann, Chairman and CEO of ASPI and Chairman and CEO of QLE. Over the last several decades, the scientists at ASPI have developed what we believe to be the most advanced isotope enrichment technologies and we look forward to accelerating these to support long-term climate goals.HALEU will be required to enable many nuclear reactors, such as SMRs (small modular reactors), to operate in the future. Currently, there are no Western producers of HALEU in commercial quantities, and many SMR companies worldwide face substantial delays until this fuel supply issue is resolved. The Nuclear Energy Institute estimates that there may be a HALEU supply demand of approximately 3,000 metric tons by 2035(2). ASPI believes their Quantum Enrichment process will be able to produce HALEU at an attractive price, allowing new nuclear energy to become available at a green discount to carbon-intensive electricity production processes. This green energy cost advantage is expected to help accelerate the global adoption of new nuclear energy, with a corresponding benefit to climate goals. The Quantum Enrichment Process, an isotope enrichment method under development by our scientists, is a laser-based enrichment method, which we believe will have both the lowest levelized cost of HALEU production, the lowest cash operating cost of HALEU production, low capital expenditure, and efficient construction cycles. Management believes that the Quantum Enrichment Process can enrich previously depleted uranium tails, which is essentially waste from other enrichers. In addition to providing a substantial cost advantage over traditional enrichment methods, globally, over 1.7 million metric tons of depleted uranium tails are becoming an environmental hazard.In summary, management believes that QLE will offer an environmental solution for uranium tails whilst providing the lowest cost HALEU supply, which will be essential for the commercialisation of SMRs.ASP Isotopes Inc. is a pre-commercial stage advanced materials company dedicated to the development of technology and processes to produce isotopes for use in multiple industries. The Company employs proprietary technology, the Aerodynamic Separation Process (ASP technology). The Companys initial focus is on producing and commercializing highly enriched isotopes for the healthcare and technology industries. The Company also plans to enrich isotopes for the nuclear energy sector using Quantum Enrichment technology that the Company is developing. The Company has isotope enrichment facilities in Pretoria, South Africa, dedicated to the enrichment of isotopes of elements with a low atomic mass (light isotopes).There is a growing demand for isotopes such as Silicon-28, which will enable quantum computing, and Molybdenum-100, Molybdenum-98, Zinc-68, Ytterbium-176, and Nickel-64 for new, emerging healthcare applications, as well as Chlorine-37, Lithium-6, and Uranium-235 for green energy applications. The ASP Technology (Aerodynamic Separation Process) is ideal for enriching low and heavy atomic mass molecules.

risk,Hello and a big welcome to our new subscribers from Iberdrola, the Finnish Government, Equinor, and more. Euractivs Green Brief brings you a roundup of energy and environment news from across Europe. You can subscribe here.New decade. This week marks the beginning of what many in Brussels consider to be the next phase of the European Green Deal  a new era focused on actually meeting the EUs objective of reaching net-zero emissions by mid-century.The European Commission threw its hat into the ring yesterday when it put forward suggestions for the EUs 2040 climate target. As widely expected, the EU executive recommended a 90% emissions reduction goal, corresponding to the lower end of the 90-95% target range advocated by the EUs Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change.This is expected to lower the EUs dependence on fossil fuels by 80% and unleash low carbon energy solutions such as renewables, nuclear, energy efficiency, storage, CCS, CCU, carbon removals, geothermal and hydro, the EU executive said. Fred Simon has the story.One of the key aspects in the 2040 climate target debate is the place reserved for carbon removals to address residual emissions from sectors like industry and agriculture. According to the Commission proposal, carbon removals should reach up to 400 MtCO2 by 2040 to offset those emissions. But environmental groups fear this will undermine the EUs efforts to reduce industrial carbon ouput in the first place. As a result, the EUs actual climate target for 2040 would be -82%, not -90%, they say.The Commission also got cold feet when it comes to tackling emissions from the agriculture sector amid farmers protests over the blocs green policies. Under pressure from the street and the European Parliament, the Commission finally dropped plans to cut agriculture emissions by at least 30% in the next 25 years. Maria Simon Arboleas reports.Industrial phase. The 90% goal in itself did not come as a surprise  it corresponds to the written commitments made by EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra when he was confirmed in his role by the European Parliament only a few months ago.The Green Deal now needs to become an industrial decarbonisation deal that builds on existing industrial strengths, like wind power, hydropower, and electrolysers, and continues to increase domestic manufacturing capacity in growth sectors like batteries, electric vehicles, heat pumps, solar PV, CCU/CCS, biogas and biomethane, and the circular economy, the Commission said in a statement.This involves creating the right framework conditions for all sectors in the economy as a precondition for meeting the 2040 targets,including on aspects like access to finance, skills, [and] affordable energy, it adds.But achieving this will involve bold steps forward, says Martin Porter from the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership (CISL) in Europe.A deal must consider specific interests, such as those of cleantech manufacturers or materials and energy-intensive producers, within acomprehensive industrial strategy for the whole EU economy, where choices and trade-offs are understood and addressed clearly, he says.To succeed, it must also no longer shy away from thegovernance, common funding, and investment implicationsof doing this effectively at the EU, rather than at the national level, Porter wrote in an op-ed for Euractiv.What we need is the decarbonisation of industry and not a deindustrialisation of Europe, added Peter Liese, a German MEP who is the environment speaker for the centre-right European Peoples Party (EPP), the largest group in Parliament. Read the story here by Nikolaus J. Kurmayer.Chinese makers have recently been flooding the European market with cheap modules due to overcapacity, creating a surplus of imported PV modules in EU warehousesestimated in a range of 7085 Gigawatts.Companies from China sell PV modules below production costs, said the European Solar Manufacturing Council (ESMC), a trade association. As a result, European producers are unable to sell their own modules, it warned.The EU is now entering a pivotal phase where, over the next 48 weeks, major EU PV module producers and their European suppliers are poised to shut down manufacturing lines unless substantial emergency measures are promptly implemented,the ESMC said. Jonathan Packroff has the details.Brussels cautious. The European Commission joined the fray on Monday when it presented a state of EU solar industry in light of unfair competition during theplenary sessionof the European Parliament.But the EU commissioner for financial services, Mairead McGuinness, warned against imposing anti-dumping tariffs on Chinese panels, saying it would harm the EUs objective of tripling its installed solar capacity by 2030, from 260 GW to 750 GW.Given that we currently rely to a very important degree on imports to reach EU solar deployment targets, any potential measure needs to be weighed against the objectives we have set ourselves when it comes to the energy transition, she told lawmakers, as reported by Reuters.Net-Zero Industry Act. European solar industry representatives also warned against imposing new tariffs on Chinese PV manufacturers, saying this strategy already failed when it was attempted in the 2010s.Rather, the industry is putting its hopes on the Net-Zero Industry Act, which would oblige EU countries to reserve a certain share of their subsidies for solar expansion to modules made outside of China, such as in Europe or the US.A formal legislative proposal will then be prepared by the next European Commission that will be appointed after the June EU elections. This means draft legislation is unlikely to appear before 2025. And it will take at least another year before the 2040 target is formally adopted and added to the European Climate Law.The European Parliament and Council have agreed a provisional deal on historic legislation aimed at ensuring greater transparency and public oversight of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) rating agencies.Germany will abstain from another EU transport law, despite initially signalling agreement, an industry source told Euractiv, as the liberal FDP party is blocking the agreement to the proposed new CO2 standards for trucks which would see the number of diesel trucks drastically reduced.A German government agreement will create state support mechanisms for up to 10 GW of newly-built gas power plants, opening the way for carbon capture in the energy sector and may delay the countrys 2035 plan for a fossil-free power system.STOCKHOLM.

risk,While Moscow isnt thought to have a deployed capability yet, the US believes the Kremlin is dabbling with weaponry that experts say could fundamentally cripple the military and the American way of life.But Kirby was tight-lipped about some key details of the weapon such as whether it was nuclear and underscored that its not a device that can be used to attack human beings or cause physical destruction here on Earth.Everything from navigation and position information whether in our cars or our cell phones using GPS weather forecasting, even TV broadcasts,  the agricultural sector leverages GPS, shipping and transportation, she added.Moscow got a glimpse of this in 2021 when it shot a missile against a satellite, triggering debris that forced two Russian cosmonauts along with their peers on the International Space Station to take cover.Unlike detonating a nuke in space [where] it affects everything within a range of detonation, a high power microwave weapon could target just individual satellites, Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who focuses on defense, warned.In particular, the military is working fast and furious right now to move away from big bulky satellites to constellations of smaller ones  similar to the ones from space guru Elon Musks StarLink system, according to Grant.What makes the satellite constellation as a whole, much less vulnerable [is that] instead of taking out one satellite, theres a whole bunch. And they can then be more easily replaced if something is lost, she said.I think a bigger concern is if theres some new development  what is Russia doing  does this mean that theyre feeling more emboldened? Do they feel that they could threaten to use or actually use capabilities like this? Harrison pondered.With relations already ice-cold between Washington and Moscow as the US mulls whether to ship additional weaponry to Ukraine, the space development is just another example of how things could spiral out of control.

risk,Type One energy has announced its intention to use a retired TVA coal plant site, the Bull Run Fossil Plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, as the site for a prototype fusion reactor with the hope to eventually commercialize fusion power and maybe even find a neat way to use old EV batteries to help power the process.The Bull Run Fossil Plant was a coal-powered generation facility first opened in 1967 and shut down on December 1, 2023 just over two months ago. It was run by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), the largest public utility in the US, and sits just across the river from Oak Ridge, the site of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), one of Americas most important national science labs.Despite only being shut down for two months, claims are already being made on the site. Due to its close location to ORNL, a lab that has studied fusion since the 1950s, it seems a natural choice for another fusion experiment enter Type One energy, a company looking to work toward the commercialization of fusion power.Type One Energy ambitiously gets its name from Type I on the Kardashev scale, a theoretical measurement intended to describe how advanced a civilization is. A Type I civilization is able to harness all of the energy available on a single planet currently, humanitys total energy production is about three orders of magnitude, or a thousand times, below this benchmark.For a basic primer on what were talking about here, Nuclear Fusion differs significantly from Nuclear Fission. Fusion is the reaction that happens inside of stars like our Sun, whereas Fission is what powers current commercial nuclear reactors.Fission, in current nuclear reactors, takes large, rare, radioactive atoms (like Uranium-235) and splits them apart, which releases energy when the bonds between neutrons in the nucleus of these atoms are broken. The major downside is that this reaction creates radioactive material, with nuclear waste still being an unsolved problem.Fusion, however, works by taking smaller atoms and fusing them together. The most promising fusion reaction uses deuterium and tritium, two rare isotopes of hydrogen that have extra neutrons in their nuclei. Deuterium is rare, but still relatively easily found in normal seawater (about one in every 6,000 natural hydrogen atoms are deuterium), whereas tritium is almost nonexistent in nature and would be manufactured by splitting lithium atoms.The upside of fusion is that it does not produce long-lived radioactive waste, and that it is incredibly energetic, with the amount of deuterium in 1 gallon of ordinary seawater (about half a milliliter of deuterium) theoretically able to generate the amount of energy from combusting 300 gallons of oil. Fusion reactors are also considered to be inherently safer as there is no possibility of a meltdown.The downside is that fusion requires extremely difficult conditions to occur, and those conditions cost a lot of energy to maintain. You can get a hint of this by looking at the location where fusion naturally happens at the center of stars, at temperatures of tens of millions of degrees and pressures of trillions of pounds per square inch.So it sounds like a science fiction concept, and ever since it was first envisioned in the 1950s, it has been. Humanity has never been able to achieve a fusion reaction that generated more energy than it took to create until recently.You may have heard the news last year that scientists had achieved net energy gain from a fusion reaction. This means that more energy was released by the fusion reaction than the amount of energy from the lasers used to produce the temperatures needed. This is denoted by the symbol Q, with Q numbers above 1 meaning net energy gain. The current record is Q = 1.54.But thats not everything, because not all of that energy can be effectively harnessed, so in order to reach the point where fusion actually becomes viable for electricity generation, the reaction must create enough energy to become self-sustaining  as long as more deuterium/tritium fuel is added, the reaction will continue, much like adding more logs to an already-burning fireplace.The primary technology advancement needed for the Type One facility is high-temperature superconducting magnets, which have generally seen remarkable progress in recent years and are now the focus of multiple companies working to adapt the basic technology forfusion energy applications. Given what is known from a scientific development standpoint, ORNL considers the step envisioned by Type One as reasonable and achievable. While success is not guaranteed, we view the risk-to-reward profile of this facility as appropriate. Ifsuccessful, the results from this facility would provide a solid basis for a second-generation facility focused on energy production.For a self-sustaining reaction, a ratio of about Q = 5 is thought to be necessary to reach the level of viability for electricity production. But once that milestone is reached, Q increases arbitrarily, because the self-sustaining nature of the reaction means that little to no energy will be needed to be spent externally to maintain the reaction.Type One thinks it can reach this milestone, though probably not for years still it sets the target at about a decade from now. As of now, it wants to build a prototype reactor its calling Infinity One at the Bull Run site, with the intent of retiring risks before building a future pilot power plant.There are a number of other fusion reactors in the world, but most of them are from public institutions run by academic, governmental, or intergovernmental sources. There are a few other fusion startups, but Type One thinks that it will be the first private company to build a functional stellerator prototype. Fusion reactors come in two types: stellerators and tokamaks, with each having their advantages but tokamaks being more common.Many of the companys personnel have already been part of stellerator projects in other settings, so there is plenty of expertise associatedincluding CTO Dr. Thomas Sunn Pederson, who we spoke to for this story, who previously worked on the record-setting W7X stellerator in Germany.The plan has been enough to get the company noticed by some government entities, with the Department of Energy choosing it as one of eight companies to receive part of $46 million in funding. Heres the full list of those companies, six of which ORNL is also partnering with:TVA is a clean energy leader. With the retirement of Bull Run plant, TVA is in the unique position to partner with Type One and ORNL to explore the repurposing of a portion of the facility toward the advancement of fusion energy research. As TVA works to be net-zero by 2050, we must work together to identify potential clean energy technologies of the future. Being able to further the advancement of fusion energy research provides a win-win proposition for TVA and the people of the valley.Despite Type Ones announcement today of its selection to pursue the use of TVAs Bull Run site, TVA issues a reminder that the project is contingent on proper completion of necessary environmental reviews, permits, operating licenses and so on. While TVA has signed a memorandum of understanding with the company and with ORNL, it hasnt yet formally agreed to lease part of the property to Type One. But it does see the unique opportunity to use a former coal for research into the future of energy, especially in a spot thats so close to one of the centers of American fusion research at Oak Ridge labs.This story interested me primarily due to the angle of turning a site that used to generate the dirtiest possible electricity into one that generates what would likely become the cleanest form of electricity, which is quite poetic.And fusion energy, in particular, has incredible promise if its ever achieved. It could solve a tremendous amount of our societal problems but like everything else, this only works if the benefits are properly distributed, and our current sociopolitical systems arent all that great at doing that.Second, Q is not the power out over the power needed to run the lasers. Its the power out to the power in the laser beam. As the article referenced above says, "Energy gain in this context only compares the energy generated to the energy in the lasers, not to the total amount of energy pulled off the grid to power the system, which is much higher."Finally, the experiment that achieved Q>1 was an inertial confinement system (blasting the hydrogen with lasers), which is completely different from magnetic confinement (tokamaks and stellarators). No magnetic confinement experiment has achieved Q>1. And the problem is not that the magnets arent strong enough; its that the plasma keeps finding ways to sneak out of the confinement fields.The upshot is that while its fine for people to work on this, it has nothing to do with solving the global heating crisis. None of this will be ready to produce power before we need to be 90% off fossil fuels. And there is zero chance that it will be cheaper than wind, water, solar, and batteries before we need to be 100% off fossils.But it could, at least, help to solve climate change, by offering a highly energetic energy source that also releases zero emissions, and has even fewer auxiliary impacts than other current clean energy sources (e.g. habitat disruption, panel/turbine recycling, and so on). And, relevant to Electrek, if lithium is needed to make tritium, then that gives us something we could use recycled EV batteries for, which is pretty cool.But we also shouldnt get too far ahead of ourselves here, because it sounds like this project is in very early stages. Todays press release is a pretty minor step Type One is just announcing the site that it wants to use, which hasnt even been secured yet. And while we had a great conversation with Type One, the responses we got from TVA and ORNL were much more noncommittal. So there was an excitement disconnect there, which is to be expected between a company and a government entity, but it still reminded us that all of this is still some ways off.So theres a lot of steps between here and fusion energy, and frankly, I think that the biggest breakthroughs in fusion are not likely to come from a private company but from academic or governmental research, at least for the time being.We will eventually need companies to come in and figure out commercial viability, so getting started on that earlier than later is all well and good, but were still going to be waiting for a while before that viability happens and unfortunately, we dont have time to wait to solve climate change. So, while fusion might help, we still need to get to work now on emissions reductions immediately.
risk,In the past weeks, the Labour Party has dramatically scaled back its 28 billion green investment plans, while the Conservative government has committed to annual licensing rounds in the North Sea in a new oil and gas bill.Wrangling between the Tories and Labour has also opened the door for fringe political activists. Parties such as Reform UK have exploited mixed messaging over climate policy, which the UN authority on climate science, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, says is essential to secure to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all.The campaign has been overshadowed by the sacking of the frontrunner candidate, Azhar Ali, who was dropped by Labour over his controversial comments about the October 7 Hamas attacks. It is too late for Labour to field another candidate, and Ali will now run as an independent.Simon Danczuk, who is standing for Reform UK, and George Galloway, the candidate for the Workers Party of Britain, have both repeatedly attacked the UKs legally binding net zero targets, while Galloway has spread climate misinformation and backed new fossil fuel extraction.This month Danczuk announced he had joined Reform UK. Danczuk was the MP for Rochdale between 2010 and 2017. He is seeking a return to the constituency following his expulsion from the Labour Party in 2015 after sending sexually explicit messages to a 17-year-old (he served as an independent until 2017).Last June he wrote an article attacking the eco-madness of Labours (now scaled back) green investment plans and its pledge not to approve new oil and gas projects. He wrote that Labour see implementing a green ideology as more important than jobs, security and sustaining the economy.The article was published in Spiked, an online libertarian outlet which has a record of climate science denial and fossil fuel-linked funding. Between 2015 and 2018, Spiked received $300,000 from the Charles Koch Foundation, an arm of oil giant Koch Industries and a major funder of climate denial.Danczuk repeated the green ideology argument in an interview with the fringe right-wing outlet Epoch Times, stating: The idea of banning gas and oil exploration in the North Sea, before weve got alternatives in place, is just absolute madness.In September 2023, Danczuk publicly voiced support for the Conservative governments net zero U-turns, telling TalkTV that voters are very despondent about these targets and that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had called it right. TalkTV has its own record of spreading climate denial, and until last year employed Reform leader Richard Tice as a presenter.Reform is campaigning to scrap all of net zero and received 135,000 in donations from climate deniers and fossil fuel interests in 2023. Tice has said CO2 isnt poison, its plant food, while the partys London mayoral candidate Howard Cox has said man is not responsible for global warming.Another ex-Labour Party MP, George Galloway, is standing for the Workers Party of Britain, a party he founded after the 2019 general election. Galloway was expelled from Labour in 2003 for bringing the party into disrepute after a party tribunal found he had incited Arabs to fight British troops and incited British troops to defy orders. He has since been elected to parliament twice  in 2005 for his Respect party and 2012 as an independent  each time serving one term.The party is hostile to climate policies. Its website calls for a much clearer debate on Net Zero and argues that a halt must also be made to the attempt to make working people pay for subsidies for large-scale green industrialisation.Last July the party called for a Brexit-style referendum on net zero, a policy originally pushed by the right-wing Reform UK and led by its honorary president Nigel Farage. (Galloway and Farage have worked together in the past as part of the Aaron Banks-funded Grassroots Out campaign for Brexit.)Galloway has attacked net zero targets, advocated for clean coal extraction and spread misinformation about climate change.In December, Galloway called for a net zero referendum in a post on the social media platform X. On his YouTube talk show in August 2022, Galloway spread the false claim that people would be forced to eat insects to tackle climate change, adding, I think this net zero is one of the biggest hoaxes in modern politics. He then took a swipe at climate activist Greta Thunberg, a regular target for climate deniers, calling net zero a 14-year old schoolgirl leading grown men and women up the garden path.The following month, he again dismissed climate warnings from activists like Thunberg, arguing that the main climate risk came from NATO and the military industrial complex. He said: We are facing climate catastrophe; not man made the likes of Greta Thunberg talks about, but through our own governments.Galloway has also called for more fossil fuel extraction. In an X post in March 2022, a month after Russias full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Galloway wrote: Britain needs to ice its [Net] Zero fantasy, step up its oil exploitation [and] invest in peaceful nuclear energy and seek to re-harvest the 1,000 years of coal under our feet employing clean-coal technology. Our Energy policy is hopelessly unbalanced.From 2008 to 2013, Galloway worked as a presenter for Press TV, the English-language channel run by the Iranian government. From 2013 to 2015 Galloway was paid 100,000 to present a show on RT (Russia Today), Russias equivalent. Both countries are major oil and gas producers. The channels have since had their broadcasting licences revoked by Ofcom for breaking its rules (Galloways broadcasts were not referenced in the ruling).According to a favourable profile in Rochdale Online, Ellison has been active in the local community protecting green spaces, and is credited with winning Rochdale recognition by the Royal Horticultural Society In Bloom awards.He doesnt appear to have commented publicly about Labours weakening of its own net zero plans. Earlier this month, the party dropped its pledge to invest 28 billion per year in green measures, cutting its spending plans by 75 percent to 23.7 billion in total. Labour says it will still keep to its target to decarbonise the UKs power grid by 2030.The party opposes new North Sea exploration, but supports unproven carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology on existing rigs. Earlier this month, Labour leader Keir Starmer said current pipelines would continue for decades.Lib Dem candidate Iain Donaldson has said he wants to hold the government to account on water companies polluting the rivers with filthy sewage, among other issues. In a 2017 tweet he criticised the then U.S. President Donald Trumps withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement.Donaldson was one of eleven of the partys 15 MPs who voted against the Offshore Petroleum Licensing Bill this week, while four abstained. The Liberal Democrats propose moving the net zero target forward five years to 2045 and support large investments in renewable energy.A Liberal Democrat spokesperson said Donaldson had opposed the oil and gas bill, which fails to take vital steps to grow the UK renewable energy sector and reduce energy bills, and fails to form a coherent path to net zero.Iain wants to see the de facto moratorium on onshore wind farms lifted, they added, and allow the expansion of the cheapest form of energy to drive down bills in this cost of living crisis, and reduce our emissions helping to slow climate change.
risk,Almost 50 environmental justice groups on Tuesday sent a letter to leaders of the federally-funded Midwestern hydrogen hub, imploring them not to try to loosen requirements for tax incentives for hydrogen produced with clean energy.The U.S. Treasury in December published draft rules saying that to receive lucrative 45V tax credits for producing clean hydrogen, the energy used must not be diverted from the grid, but be additional energy created specifically to power the electrolysis process used to produce pure hydrogen from water.Environmental advocates are largely pleased with Treasurys draft rules, which also say clean energy must be generated around the same time and near where it is used for hydrogen production, to reap incentives. But organizations are worried that industry groups are lobbying to weaken the draft rules, which are open for public comment through Feb. 26.The Midwest Alliance for Clean Hydrogen (MachH2), a coalition of industry and research groups that won up to $1 billion in Department of Energy hydrogen hub funding, has proposed to produce much pink hydrogen powered by nuclear energy from Illinois. Critics say this, as well as green hydrogen produced with solar and wind, could divert zero-emissions power from other users and hence prolong the lives of fossil-fuel-fired generators that fill the gaps.If MachH2 imperils the achievement of our states climate goals, harms the health of our communities, and causes electricity price spikes that disproportionality impact low- and moderate-income households, it will face stiff opposition from our coalition and from communities that will bear the brunt of harmful, and avoidable, pollution, says the letter from 47 organizations, including We the People of Detroit, Interfaith Power & Light, North Dakota Native Vote, StraightUp Solar, the Sierra Club, Eco-Justice Collaborative and Illinois Peoples Action.The environmental and justice groups praised the draft 45V rules for including three pillars the groups see as crucial to making sure clean hydrogen is truly clean. Those pillars mean clean hydrogen production tax credits will only be awarded if new clean energy is used to power the projects, and the clean energy can actually be delivered to the site of the electrolysis around the time it is needed. The draft rules say that to be considered additional, the energy source must have been built within 36 months before the hydrogen production goes online.Accounting known as hourly matching, which can be verified with Environmental Attribute Certificates, ensures that hydrogen production isnt removing clean energy from the grid that could be used by consumers at times of high demand.A 2023 study by researchers at Princeton Universitys Center for Energy and the Environment modeled the emissions impact that hydrogen production by electrolysis would have in the western U.S., and found that all three pillars would be necessary to ensure overall emissions dont exceed fossil fuel generation.The environmental justice organizations letter notes that the EPA has supported the Treasury departments decision that induced emissions on the grid  caused by replacing electricity diverted for hydrogen production  should be counted as indirect emissions of hydrogen.Backsliding on Treasurys proposed rule would lead to significant emissions increases from hydrogen production, in violation of 45Vs statutory requirements, said the organizations letter. It would also directly harm communities that are home to some of our states dirtiest power plants, which would run more to replace the zero-carbon energy diverted to hydrogen production.Treasury asked for comment on possible exemptions to the additionality requirement, including the possibility that existing nuclear and hydroelectric plants could receive the tax credit, or that existing plants could get the tax credit if it helps them avoid retirement. Advocates have called these possible changes in the rules loopholes. An analysis by the Rhodium Group found these exemptions would generally increase greenhouse gas emissions, compared to modeling under the rules without exemptions.Treasury needs to reject the loopholes industry is demanding, which would create enormous subsidies for dirty hydrogen, lock in more fossil fuel production and use, and increase dangerous health and climate-harming pollution, Piette said. Especially damaging would be any loopholes to the incrementality requirement, which are based on industrys speculative claims about retirement risk, curtailment, and modeling. Such loopholes would reward the hydrogen industry for siphoning critical zero-carbon energy from the grid, creating a massive power demand that would be filled by our dirtiest power plants  the ones that should be retiring, not ramping up.The letter charges that if the three pillars arent mandates for receiving tax incentives, the electricity diverted from the grid to hydrogen production will cause consumers energy bills to spike. They point to cryptocurrency mining as an example of how this phenomenon has played out.Cryptomining, which is subject to minimal constraints and requirements, has increased utility bills by tens to hundreds of millions of dollars for households and businesses in upstate New York and led to costly grid strains in Texas, the letter says.BPs Whiting oil refinery in Northwest Indiana is a focal point of the proposed Midwest hydrogen hub, as the company plans to ramp up hydrogen production at the site and provide it to regional users. BP asked the Treasury department to allow hydrogen made from existing generation to receive tax credits.We encourage the IRS and Treasury to adopt flexible criteria on additionality especially at this nascent stage, said BP Americas comment to the IRS. Strict additionality rules requiring electrolytic hydrogen to be powered by new renewable energy is not practical, especially in the early years, and will severely limit development of hydrogen projects.BP and other members also argued against the requirement for hourly matching of renewable energy generation to use in hydrogen production, arguing instead for yearly matching. The draft rules currently allow for yearly matching until 2028, then hourly matching becomes mandatory.Stringent requirements such as hourly zero-emission matching have the potential to devastate the economics of clean hydrogen production, said BPs comment. Moreover, such restrictive requirements are likely not practical or feasible in these early stages. If a green hydrogen production facility can only produce during hours when wind and solar are available, the low utilization rate will dramatically increase the price of the hydrogen produced.Bloom Energy Corporation, which manufactures electrolyzers, also said that adequate technology does not exist to timestamp energy generation and use in order to ensure that clean energy is generated when it is needed for hydrogen production.Since electrolyzers will comprise a very small percentage of the overall EAC-qualifying energy produced for many years to come, there is ample time for those state, regional and voluntary bodies to work through their stakeholder processes and make any changes as needed to adjust those systems so as to avoid unintended outcomes, said Bloom Energy in its comment, referring to Environmental Attribute Certificates.The Princeton study noted that hourly matching can add considerable costs to hydrogen production, but said the 45V tax credit would be lucrative enough to compensate for those costs while driving the market development of better hourly matching mechanisms.Setting an expectation of hourly matched clean energy will provide a market signal for the clean energy investments needed to further drive decarbonization in the power sector, said the nuclear companys comment.But Constellation is asking for exemptions to additionality, asking the government to decide that hydrogen made with behind-the-meter generation from existing plants qualifies for tax credits. The MachH2 hydrogen hub proposal calls for an electrolyzer on the site of Constellations LaSalle nuclear plant in Illinois, which could provide behind-the-meter electricity. But this electricity would still represent clean power that otherwise could have been sent to the grid, critics say.Measuring carbon content for nuclear fuel is not typically done by the mining, enrichment, fabrication and transport vendors in the nuclear fuel supply chain, and it would be extremely cumbersome, costly, and labor intensive to impose these requirements on said vendors, Constellation said.The letter to MachH2 comes as grassroots groups and environmental organizations are increasingly organizing around still murky but well-funded plans for hydrogen to be used in everything from power generation to steelmaking to transportation, including as part of the seven federally-funded hubs.On February 1, the national collaborative Just Solutions Collective released an Environmental Justice Platform on hydrogen, demanding strict limits on the type of hydrogen production and use that is incentivized as part of a clean energy shift.The organization says hydrogen production from natural gas, and hydrogen produced with power from the grid, should be ruled out since fossil fuel-based hydrogen fails to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, by many estimates. They also demanded strict safety protocols around new hydrogen development, strident protections for water resources, protections around chemicals added to hydrogen fuels, and transparency in all hydrogen-related projects.Just Solutions leaders hope their platform influences policymakers and also helps community groups more effectively weigh in on plans for expanding hydrogen, including as the U.S. Department of Energy invests $7 billion in the seven hydrogen hubs nationwide.The framework is meant to be a resource for climate and environmental justice advocates so they can advance clean energy technology that meaningfully addresses the climate crisis and to stop false solutions from taking root in our communities, Just Solutions senior fellow and strategist Sylvia Chi said in a January webinar.Environmental justice organizations in other parts of the country have also opposed hydrogen hub plans. Last summer Indigenous, environmental justice, and youth groups urged the Biden administration not to fund a hydrogen hub based in Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, and that proposal was not among the seven selected.DOE is saying a lot of the right things, but there is widespread concern that environmental justice is going to be set off to the side and figured out later, after contracts are signed and projects are approved, said Piette. We have yet to hear a clear answer on whether communities will be able to say no to a Hub project. DOE needs to give its own guidance teeth and hold Hubs accountable to local communities, especially those already experiencing cumulative burdens of decades of fossil fuel pollution.The report points to a pilot program in New York state where the Nine Mile nuclear plant is powering hydrogen production. While the nuclear power is zero emissions, it displaces energy from the grid that, when replaced by New Yorks natural gas-heavy energy mix, increases overall greenhouse gas emissions.IEER argues that the ideal place for zero-emissions-produced hydrogen is in areas like California and Texas where theres often much more wind or solar power available than the grid can handle. These renewables are regularly curtailed, or kept off the grid, simply going to waste. A possible exemption to the additionality requirement for tax credits that Treasury has floated includes existing generation during times that renewables would be curtailed.The IEER report estimates that curtailed renewables at current levels could produce 34,000 tons of hydrogen annually in California, and 150,000 tons in Texas. And the availability of renewables in those and other states is only expected to increase.The MachH2 hub is one of the best situated in the country, able to take advantage of excellent wind and solar resources in the Midwest, the letter says. With the anticipated buildout of new renewable energy in this region, the projects funded by the hub will have no difficulty procuring cost-competitive, new, hourly-matched power from the proposed deliverability zone to claim the 45V tax credit.Environmental justice groups ask feds to resist weakening rules on clean hydrogen tax credit is an article from Energy News Network, a nonprofit news service covering the clean energy transition.

risk,Its the coldest time of the year, and the demand for energy is significantly higher as people try to warm their homes. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), in Alabama seven out of ten homes rely on electric heating during the winter months. Increasing demand is placing a strain on our power grid, and the Biden administration has no solution to the problem.Instead of providing families with reliable energy, Joe Biden and his administration have other priorities. Theyve spent the last three years on a crusade to make America dependent on unreliable energy sources such as wind and solar power, all in the name of supposedly fighting climate change. While wind and solar have roles to play in domestic energy production, we simply cannot rely on them. The sun doesnt always shine and the wind doesnt always blow, but our energy grid needs to run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.Despite Joe Bidens best efforts, most of our energy still comes from fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas. Democrats dont like to admit this, but when wind and solar power fail, the backup generators are powered by oil and natural gas. Without fossil fuels, our energy grid and our economy could not function.Right now, nuclear energy accounts for approximately 20% of our power grid, which is more than wind and solar combined. The U.S. has the most nuclear power production of any country in the world, but we could be producing even more. Burdensome regulations and bureaucratic red tape from the Biden administration are slowing down nuclear permitting and production from doing even more.Once again, Democrat politicians would rather play politics than do what is best for the working people of this country. They know their left-wing voter base hates nuclear energyand they wont risk offending them.There is neither an economic nor a scientific basis for opposition to nuclear energy, which is the single most efficient source of energy known to man. It is 8,000 times more efficient than fossil fuelswhich are already much more efficient than wind and solar power. This efficiency grants nuclear power an unparalleled ability to bring down the price of energyand, in turn, reduce prices throughout our economy.Nuclear is also safe for the environment. Nuclear energy produces zero emissions and removes harmful pollutants from the atmosphere. Claims that nuclear energy production is dangerous are simply outdated. After the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, there was a panic among Americans, and the federal government canceled President Nixons goal of building 1,000 nuclear reactors. Despite zero deaths from the Three Mile Island incident, our energy policy has never recovered from this mistake and continues declining with the close of 13 American nuclear reactors since 2013.Scientists are always working to learn from the past and improve our technical knowledge. We know a lot more about nuclear safety now than we did in 1979. Our technology is better than ever and continues to improve each day.Alabama understands this better than almost any state as we are proud to be the nations fifth-largest producer of nuclear energy with two nuclear plants and five nuclear reactors. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) operates Browns Ferry in Athens, Alabama, which is their largest nuclear plant and has the second-largest nuclear power generating capacity in the nation. Browns Ferry directly supports 1,500 Alabama jobs and powers more than two million homes.On the other end of the state, just outside of Dothan, Alabama Power runs Plant Farley, generating nearly 20% of Alabama Powers electricity. Plant Farley supports 900 good jobs in the Wiregrass area, and I am grateful to Alabamas energy workers for keeping the lights on for us.America needs to learn from Alabama. We need to stop the obsession with wind and solar energy and do a better job of investing in nuclear energy. The polls show that a clear majority of the public wants more nuclear powerand that majority is growing by the day. Its good economics. Its good energy policy. Its good environmental policy. And its long overdue.
risk,As the second-largest producer of chemicalsChina is No. 1serious people understand the indispensable role the European chemical sector plays in safeguarding economic prosperity for Europeans. Ours is an industry that drives innovation, job security, and manufactures the products that enable Europe to prosper and thrive. Unfortunately, too many government and business leaders have forgotten how things are made and, as a result, implement self-defeating public policy.For those not yet convinced, allow me to be clear: Nearly every product and technology system necessary to ensure the EUs publicly-declared climate objectives requires a range of complex and technical chemicals that originate fromyou guessed itthe chemical sector. Ignoring this fact and believing European society can simply transition away from nuclear energy, fossil fuels and chemicals, somehow maintain its way of life, and reach its Green Deal objectives, is both naive and dangerous. The truth is that the European Green Deal can only become reality with increased European extraction of minerals and fossil fuels and their refinement into raw materials.Enabling a more prosperous, lower emission future is a goal we all share. Yet, Im regularly puzzled at how many EU and U.S. policymakers overlook basic science and the complex supply chains required to manufacture the marvels of modern life: lighter-weight airplanes and cars, fertilizer, wind turbines and more energy efficient homes.This disconnect has created an existential crisis for the chemical sector in Europe and will hinder economic prosperity and the sustainability ambitions for younger generations. According to many polls, younger citizens are most concerned with the environment and believe a changing climate is an existential crisis for their own lives. The reality is they are the ones most vulnerable to the collapse of the chemical sector because their quality of life will diminish. They will feel the most frauded as electric vehicle batteries and wind turbines become too costly, unprofitable, and impossible to scale. And they will be stuck with the bill.Civil society and NGOs have vilified the chemical industry for decades, ignoring their essential role in lifting humanity. This has led to widespread reluctance to acknowledge the positive and critical role our sector plays in meeting Europes objectives. Future innovation and scaling of green technologies will be impossible if our industry is not preserved in Europe.The combination of increased energy costs and the overwhelming amount of regulation have caused energy intensive companies to question if they can continue to operate in Europe. Eventually, unprofitable businesses cease to exist. This is the worst and most irresponsible outcome for the planet, as industry will be driven to markets with less stringent environmental laws. We will simply see an outsourcing of greenhouse gas emissions to less-regulated markets and more expensive goods made abroad.Policymakers must reflect honestly on where we are as a society and what we want to achieve. While we all want to take action to cut emissions and increase energy efficiency, we also need to face the reality that we do not currently possess all the technologies and energy sources needed to meet Green Deal targets. As we are learning in real time, there is only so much of other peoples money societies can allocate to unprofitable and less reliable energy systems.The upcoming European Commissions Draghi report on the future of EU competitiveness, requested by President Ursula von der Leyen, presents an opportunity for industry leaders to be better consulted, better informed and speak truth to power about the chemical sectors current state of affairs. Europe must do away with EV mandates, speed the transition from coal to natural gas and incentivize companies to modernize existing facilities. The Commission should cut back on some of its regulatory proposals and become familiar with the industrys challenges by implementing existing laws in a way that appropriately manage risk and make peoples lives better.Honest conversations are hard, yet true leadership requires them. Reality and honesty are the only ways forward to the lower emissions and prosperous future envisioned in the European Green Deal. The chemical sector in Europe depends on it.

safe,I grew up in Connecticut and studied nuclear-energy engineering technology before joining the Navy in 2011. I worked on a submarine, so I moved around a lot. I was stationed in South Carolina, New York, and Hawaii and visited places like Singapore.Right after my contract with the Navy ended in 2017, I moved to San Francisco to work at Tesla, and then I took a job at my current company, KLA. I took the job knowing it was based in San Francisco, but I kept telling my boss that I would be interested in moving to Singapore if the opportunity arose.I lived in the Tenderloin in San Francisco. Nearly every time I got off the Bay Area Rapid Transit trains in the city at night, I would see people using and selling drugs. My car was also broken into frequently.The food is really good because the surrounding countries  including Malaysia, India, and China  heavily influence Singaporean culture. I love very spicy food, so mala and hotpot are my favorites. I like to order  (big spicy) occasionally, but I limit that to once a month since it takes a toll on my body.Singapore has big street markets with various food stalls that sell what's known as "hawker" food. I eat that at the office most days. For $3.71, I usually get noodles and dumpling soup. When working from home, I like to go to my local hawker  (economic rice) stall and get a portion of pork, chicken, and rice for $2.08.Healthcare isn't free, but it's much cheaper than in the US. I recently jammed my toe so hard, I was convinced it was broken. I went to the emergency room, got X-rays, and saw a doctor, and it cost under $200. I imagine that would've cost thousands of dollars in the US.Singapore is quite diverse, and people live comfortably with each other. I occasionally get stares in certain areas, but overall, people are friendly. Many Europeans and Americans work here, so I don't stand out too much.As an American, living without a car feels like not having freedom, but I think buying a car in Singapore is financially irresponsible unless you have many kids and need to move around. Here, you could order a taxi or private hire car to drive you around daily for about the same price as owning a car.Singapore is one of the most expensive cities in the world, but when I lived in San Francisco, the rent was even more expensive. The salaries in the Bay Area are much higher than in Singapore, but taxes are much lower here, so it balances out.
safe,The world is currently in the process of reevaluating its past rejection of nuclear power and is increasingly starting to view it as a reliable source of power that allows for greater energy security. This is at least in part due to the energy crisis that befell Europe after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, vindicating past worries that over-reliance on fossil fuels from autocratic regimes has made the Western countries vulnerable to political blackmail.It is now clear that Western use of natural gas and petroleum from aggressive dictatorshipswhich use cash flows from oil and gas sales to reinforce and expand their hold on powerhas backfired badly. In this context, the experience of Armeniaa small country that draws 40 percent of its energy from nuclear poweris instructive, showing how nuclear power can be instrumental in building societal reliance and political stability.Living in the dark cold. It is the winter of 19921993. As I climb the dark stairs in a freezing-cold Soviet apartment building in Yerevan, the capital of Armenia where my family and I live, the water from the two full buckets I carry is splashing down my legs and freezing on the stairs. My sister Shooshan and I, 14 and 15, are carrying water up to our 11th-floor apartment. The water to our apartment shut off weeks ago, and we get at most one hour of electricity each day. I estimate that we need exactly seven gallons of water, if we are careful, for our basic daily needs. So, we repeat the trip every day. During the precious hour when we do get electricity, my mother rushes to the kitchen to cook food for the next 24 hours. I run to the bakery, where I stand in a long queue to buy the half pound of bread that the state has rationed for each one of us.The daily routine, which goes on for the whole winter, is exhausting. But it is also empowering. As teenagers we feel that we are stronger than the disastrous conditions inflicted on us by the combination of the Soviet collapse, the Nagorno-Karabakh war, and the ensuing severe energy crisis.The reasons that my sister and Iand the thousands of other Armenian teenagers like ushad to lug water and plan their lives around the one hour of electricity during that cruel winter go back to the turbulent events that shook Armenia during the preceding decades.In the 1970s and 1980s, the Soviet Unionwhich Armenia was part ofrapidly expanded its fleet of nuclear reactors to support its growing industrial energy needs. As a result, two pressurized water reactors (PWR) of the Soviet VVER-440 type were built in the Armenian town of Metsamor, about 30 kilometers west of Yerevan. Started in 1977 and 1980, respectively, the two reactors quickly covered more than half of the energy needs of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. (The remainder of the electricity was generated by Armenias hydroelectric stations and gas-fired power plants.) The Armenia of the 1980s was a tiny but prosperous Soviet republic that prided itself in a highly educated labor force, an array of scientific institutes, and a vibrant electronics industry that produced some of the early Soviet computer mainframe designs.Chernobyl. On April 26, 1986, one of the Soviet-designed, graphite-moderated RBMK reactors at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant underwent a catastrophic power excursion that ripped the reactor open. The explosion and fire that followed propelled an enormous amount of radioactive matter into the open atmosphere leading to what is now known as the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, with widespread radioactive contamination, hundreds of deaths from acute radiation poisoning, and likely thousands of additional deaths due to radiation-induced cancers in the months and years that followed.The Chernobyl accident resonated worldwide, dramatically undermining public trust in nuclear power as a safe source of energy. The public perception of danger from nuclear power was magnified by the outrageous lies that the Soviet leadership spread about the disaster, the obvious incompetence and irresponsibility of the Soviet nuclear designers who built and operated the Chernobyl reactor, and the poorly executed cleanup efforts which were compounded by miscalculations and gross mistakes.Overnight, citizens across the Soviet Union and beyond went from a blissful ignorance about radiation to an understandableyet irrationalfear of anything radiation-related. People in Armenia, despite living more than 2,000 kilometers away from Chernobyl, started perceiving radioactive threats everywhere, often attributing many of their common ailments to radiation. Physicists, like my parents, tried to explain what radiation is and how natural doses of radiation are not dangerous. But their advice was sometimes met with hostility: Werent the builders of Chernobyl also scientists?In one chilling conversation that I witnessed at a dinner party, one of the guests told my father only half in jest, You physicists you should all be shot! To paraphrase Valery Legasovs eponymous character from HBOs five-part mini-series Chernobyl: The danger of the lies is not that we mistake them for the truth, but that when enough lies are told we lose hope in the truth and start believing in stories. (Legasov was a Soviet chemist who actively worked on the causes and consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. Concerned by the lack of nuclear safety in the Soviet nuclear industry, he died by suicide on April 27, 1988.)An earthquake, the Soviet collapse, and war. In December 1988, the devastating earthquake of Spitak killed 50,000 peoplea harrowing 2 percent of Armenias populationand destroyed most of the countrys infrastructure. The two VVER-440 reactors at Metsamor were suddenly in the public eye. Would another earthquake rip them open and turn Armenias heartland, where half of Armenias population lived, into a Chernobyl-like radioactive wasteland?To be clear, the PWRs at Metsamor are safer than the shoddily designed, graphite-moderated reactors at Chernobyl. Metsamors Soviet reactor design is close to the standard PWR designs that are still the most common reactor technology used in Western countries. And the buildings and the reactor structures were reinforced to account for Armenias seismic activity. But none of that mattered. After the Soviet governments grotesque lies about the Chernobyl disaster, the official assurances that the Metsamor reactors were safe did not convince many. Legasovs intuition was right: The pursuit for truth was replaced with belief in conspiratorial rumors. An environmentalist movement sprang up, calling for the shutdown of the Metsamor reactors. The authorities backed down, and the two reactors were turned off on February 25 and March 18, 1989.Shortly after the shutdown, the Soviet Union started to crack, finally collapsing in 1991. In neighboring Azerbaijan, an Armenian minority living in the mountainous Nagorno-Karabakh region, feeling marginalized and discriminated against, had long been fighting to protect their civil rights. With the weakening of Soviet power, the protest movement turned into demands for secession from Azerbaijan. The response in Azerbaijan was a series of brutal anti-Armenian pogroms in the cities of Sumgait and Baku that killed hundreds of Armenian civilians and forced about 300,000 others to flee the country. Fearing retaliation, the Azeri civilians living in Armenia fled en masse to Azerbaijan.A relatively peaceful political disagreement had suddenly turned into a violent conflict, with Azerbaijans pogroms against Armenians escalating to a total war against the Armenian people of Nagorno-Karabakh. As the Armenian government supported the Nagorno-Karabakh secessionists, Azerbaijan retaliated by shutting off some of the natural gas pipelines that led to Armenia. In a sense, Azerbaijans authorities did to Armenia what Russian President Vladimir Putin is now doing to Western European countries that support Ukraines war effort. With its nuclear reactors and natural gas supply shut down, Armenia was left with a reduced capacity to generate electricity.Then came the winter of 19921993. Mountain rivers froze, hydroelectric dams dried up, and suddenly hydropower too was nearly gone. Armenia was getting barely a trickle of electricity. What followed is a period now known in Armenia as tsurt u mut tariner, literally the cold and dark years: severe shortages of electricity, freezing concrete apartment complexes, closed schools, and many other disruptions. The economy collapsed, with Armenias gross domestic product contracting by an estimated 50 to 80 percent between 1990 and 1993. Then, a massive exodus followed, shrinking Armenias population by a quarter in just a few years.Nuclear power revival. The Armenian public quickly realized that, by abandoning nuclear power, it had forfeited the countrys energy independence. That vulnerability wasand still isvery effectively leveraged by its arch-enemy Azerbaijan. Was it too late to restore nuclear power?Understanding their mistake, the Armenian authorities re-evaluated their past decision. The choice was stark: Either indulge in exaggerated fears of radiation and face unpredictable consequences, or sober up and accept nuclear power as a lesser evil. Ultimately the government chose the sober option. But rather than rushing headfirst to hastily restart the Metsamor nuclear power plant, the authorities decided to make significant safety improvements to the reactors.One of the Metsamor reactors finally restarted on November 5, 1995, just before the winter season. The desperately needed 400 megawatts flowed again into the small countrys languishing power grid. Almost overnight, lights were turned on, water pumps worked again, and industries revved up to capacity. Children like my sister and I stopped their exhausting routine and Armenia became a net exporter of electricity.Over the 13 years that followed, Armenias economy grew by an unprecedented 700 percent. The difficult decision to restore nuclear power had saved Armenia and had put it on a path of development. In 2020, about 35 percent of electricity generated in Armenia came from nuclear, 25 percent came from renewables (primarily hydropower), and the remaining 40 percent from fossil fuels. (In 2021, the share of nuclear power temporarily dropped to 26 percent because the Metsamor reactor was shut down longer than usual to perform a thermal annealing of the pressure vessel, a maintenance method aimed at managing aging effects.)Despite its important contribution to the electricity mix, the nuclear power plant at Metsamor is not without problems. Mainly, like most Soviet-era PWRs, the reactor does not have the external containment building that is common with Western designs. It is also an aging machine. Because of Armenias growing energy needs, the Metsamor reactor has been issued multiple lifetime extensions. Based on current plans, Metsamors VVER-440 reactor will shut down permanently by 2036. Meanwhile the Armenian government has been busy exploring replacement alternatives, such as possibly US-built small modular reactors (SMRs), seen as a viable replacement. Armenian officials have also entered in discussions with Russia about the possibility of replacing the Soviet-era VVER-440 reactor with the much larger and more modern Russian VVER-1200 design. While the US option is not easymainly because of the lack of readiness of most SMR designsthe Russian option is particularly fraught. Armenia is reluctant to further increase its energy dependence on Russia, given Putins campaign of neo-Soviet expansionism. This is further exacerbated by the technical and economic difficulty of hosting a 1200-megawatt electric VVER-1200 unit on a grid that on average consumes only about 1,000 megawatts.Survival in the shadow of petro-dictatorship. In recent years, social scientists have studied the negative impacts of nuclear power on underprivileged communities, such as the effects of uranium mining on indigenous populations. These studies are important for understanding the social cost of this resource. However very rarely have scholars studied the positive impact that nuclear power has had in helping the victims of oppression.Most of the three million inhabitants in Armenia trace their lineage to the survivors of the Armenian Genocide of 1915. Most live near the border with the perpetrator state of Turkey, which to this day refuses to acknowledge its crime and in the recent past has actively helped Azerbaijan. Since 1993, Azerbaijan has been ruled by the Aliyev dynasty with an iron fist, strengthened by the cash flows from the export of the countrys large hydrocarbon reserves to Western countries. To further strengthen his hold on power, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev (son of Heydar Aliyev who held power in Azerbaijan for several decades) has tapped into Azerbaijanis trauma from the 1990s by demonizing Armenians and blaming all of Azerbaijans ill on this minority.Since he took power in 2003, the regime of Aliyev son has been accused of curtailing free speech and ethnic cleansing of Armenians, whereas Azerbaijans armed forces have been busy mounting a campaign of widespread cultural erasure. These decades of threats culminated in last September with a swift military attack on the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which in just one week brought the 3,000-year-old indigenous Armenian presence there effectively to an end. The situation currently is so severe that Luis Moreno Ocampo, a former chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, has warned that a new genocide may be underway.Armenians, whose newly budding democracy is under constant threat from the various authoritarian governments in the region, cannot achieve cultural and existential security if they do not have a state that ensures their security. And that includes energy security, to which nuclear power generation is key. Of course, Azerbaijan deserves to have a democratic government, too, something that is being hindered by the Western countries over-reliance on fossil fuel exports.The lessons of small nations. When it comes to understanding the value of nuclear energy, studies tend to focus on the big nuclear powers such as the United States, China, and Russia. They rarely study the experiences of small countries like Armenia. Still, the study of these insignificant players is important in terms of understanding the mistakes made, successes achieved, and lessons learned, which can be relevant for the big players as well. In a telling example, Germany is learning the hard way about the dangers of complacency when it comes to choosing between nuclear energy and fossil fuels for its energy mix: Over the last 20 years, German politicians preferred to shut down their scarybut nonetheless safenuclear power plants and increase their potentially destabilizingbut considered harmlessreliance on Russias natural gas. Had German policymakers studied Armenias experience of the 1990s, they could probably have avoided the energy crisis the country is currently experiencing.Sadly, its hard to tell whether European leaders have learned anything from Armenias struggle for energy security. In a now much-criticized statement from 2022, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called Azerbaijans dictator Ilham Aliyev a reliable partner. This gesture is now believed to have, at least partly, emboldened the Aliyev regimes brutality toward the Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh. At least for now, it is as if Europe is merely switching dictators while maintaining the same dependence on fossil fuels.Only a full reckoning by Western countries of their over-reliance on fossil fuels can put an end to the authoritarian regimes that exist only because of their hydrocarbon exports. Such a reckoning, along with the development of renewable energy and nuclear power, would lead to net gains for the climate and the environment. It would also help strengthen liberal democracies that are being unprecedently threatened.The Bulletin elevates expert voices above the noise.

I would love to visit my parents home country some day, and tour our nuclear facilities as a partner and advocate myself.Thank you for the article, indeed those years without electricity had a huge negative impact not only economical but also social and psychological.

Read on to learn how sustainable investing works, some examples of sustainable investing and how to build a socially responsible investment portfolio.In general, sustainable investing can encompass a wide spectrum of investment activities that range from traditional finance to philanthropy, according to Jeff Finkelman, chartered financial analyst and managing director of sustainable investments at Fiduciary Trust International.It includes simple strategies that seek only to avoid certain industries, such as tobacco or firearms, as well as those that strive to generate positive social or environmental change with investments in renewable energy, affordable housing or any number of other challenging markets in need of capital, he said.Sustainable investors often use negative or exclusionary screening to avoid investing in companies that dont meet certain ESG criteria. Using this approach, an investor may refuse to buy a companys securities if it scores poorly compared with its peers on ESG factors.Some investors choose to exclude entire industries from their portfolios. For example, an investor may avoid sin stocks, generally defined as businesses that many people consider unethical, such as tobacco, alcohol, firearms, gambling and adult entertainment. Or you may refuse to invest in oil or nuclear energy stocks due to their environmental impact or in private prisons out of social concerns.Another approach is to use positive screening, also known as a best-in-class approach. Essentially, this is when investors look for companies and sectors that rank better on ESG factors than their peers. For instance, an investor may choose to invest only in companies that rank above at least 50% of their peers based on a number of preselected criteria.While the terms sustainable investing and ESG investing are often used interchangeably, theyre not quite the same thing. ESG investing is one type of sustainable investing, but there are several other strategies that fall under the sustainable investing umbrella.Impact investing is where you aim to achieve measurable environmental or social goals while also earning financial returns. For example, many communities in the US are considered food deserts, which means they have little access to fresh, healthy food. Investing in a grocery store or restaurant that provides healthy food in one of these communities would be a form of impact investing. The goal is to measurably improve the nutrition of residents, but you also aim to earn a profit on your investment.Another approach is to use thematic funds to invest money in a cause that matters to you. You can find mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that invest around an array of themes, such as womens leadership, clean energy and global health care. You could also invest in individual companies that are proactively working to address issues you care about.One of the big misconceptions about sustainable investing is that its less profitable than other investment approaches. The evidence is mixed, though. Some studies suggest that theres no relationship between sustainability factors and a funds performance, while others conclude that sustainable funds perform at least as well as other funds in their peer group.At the individual company level, theres evidence that adherence to sustainable principles is good for profits. Researchers at New York Universitys Stern School of Business found that sustainability initiatives at corporations are associated with more innovation, and that low carbon strategies were linked to positive financial performance.Sustainable investments may also be less risky than companies that dont have a track record of socially responsible practices. For example, a company with a strong commitment to ESG factors are less likely to be at the center of an environmental disaster, a data breach or a fraud case.Sustainable investing matters because it helps you build wealth in a way that doesnt conflict with your conscience. Many people arent comfortable investing in companies that they believe have a negative impact on the world. With sustainable investing, you can earn profits while avoiding companies that have a poor track record of hurting the environment or violating human rights. You can also proactively invest in companies and projects that are doing good in the world.There were more than 600 mutual funds and ETFs focused on sustainable investments as of 2022, according to US SIF: The Sustainable Investment Forum. Here are just a few examples of sustainable investment funds:You dont have to sacrifice profits to invest sustainably. Whether youre investing in mutual funds or ETFs or individual companies and projects, there are a number of ways to earn profits ethically. You can invest in funds or shares of companies based on whether they adhere to specific ESG criteria, or you can avoid investing in companies whose products and practices conflict with your values. Not only can you feel good about the fact that youre investing with a conscience, but some evidence suggests sustainable investing produces superior returns, particularly in the long run.You can invest sustainably by investing in ESG mutual funds and ETFs or by investing in companies that have strong ESG scores. You can also avoid companies that rank poorly on ESG criteria or that have a history of unethical practices. Some people choose to avoid certain types of companies altogether, such as those that make tobacco or firearms.Sustainable investing is a strategy where you aim to have a positive impact on the world. ESG investing and impact investing are two forms of sustainable investing. ESG investors use environmental, social and governance factors to determine whether an investment is sustainable. Impact investing is a strategy where the focus is achieving a measurable goal that benefits the planet or humanity, in addition to earning positive returns.First, make sure you define your values and what causes you care about, as well as any industries or business practices you consider unethical. If youre interested in mutual funds and ETFs, look for funds that invest according to the themes that matter to you or that screen out investments that conflict with your values. If you want to invest in individual companies, look at ESG ratings from third-party agencies, as well as those that are investing in projects you believe can have a positive long-term impact on the world.The editorial content on this page is based solely on objective, independent assessments by our writers and is not influenced by advertising or partnerships.

safe,The shock caused in part by Russias war in Ukraine will transform the global energy industry. Governments in the West are looking to end their reliance on Russian oil and gas, which is giving a boost to climate-friendly alternatives. They include nuclear-power plants. Some countries, notably including Germany, remain fearful of another Chernobyl or Fukushima. But even when accounting for the high-profile disasters, nuclear power is very safe (see chart).A terawatt-hour (TWh) of electricity from nuclear energy is associated with 0.03 deaths (including indirect deaths from disasters and workplace accidents at the plants). That makes it even safer than wind energy, which is associated with 0.04 deaths per TWh, mostly from accidents during the installation process, drownings on offshore sites and helicopter collisions with turbines. Only solar energy is less deadly than nuclear. Coal is the deadliest because of the air pollution it causes: one TWh is linked to 24.6 deaths.As a rule, the safest energy sources are also the greenest. Nuclear energy produces just four tonnes of greenhouse gases per gigawatt-hour of electricity (GWh), the same as wind energy (this includes emissions from the mining of fuels, transportation and maintenance of a plant). Despite this, nuclear energy used for electricity production has been in decline since 2001 and now only accounts for a tenth of the global total. Fossil fuels still produce most of the worlds electricity: coal, gas and oil made up around 62% last year. The share of renewables has been growing over the last decade, yet wind energy makes up just 7% of the total and solar energy 4%.Nuclear energy has had an image problem for some time. Major accidents have made it seem more deadly than it is and the storage of nuclear waste remains controversial. But attitudes are shifting. Germany had planned to turn off its remaining three nuclear plants by the end of the year. Now, amid concerns about the countrys dependence on Russian gas and soaring energy prices, its government appears to be re-considering. Britain is constructing its first new nuclear plant in more than two decades. And in France, the government is set to pay 9.7bn ($9.9bn) to fully nationalise lectricit de France, one of the worlds biggest energy suppliers, to help fund six new nuclear reactors. Nuclear appears to be back in vogue.
safe,"The perception that nuclear energy is dangerous is not true. It depends on the sector and the use because the technology we produce is for peaceful purposes and is suitable for people's daily use, such as in medicine and agriculture."We can use nuclear technology to solve problems. Mosti researchers, for example, are actively involved in solving problems related to food security," he said after opening the Mosti Targeted Promotion Programme here on Tuesday (Feb 27).He said the negative perception that nuclear technology was dangerous needed to be changed, in line with the implementation of the National Nuclear Technology Policy 2030 launched last September, Bernama reported.Malaysian Nuclear Agency director-general Dr Rosli Darmawan said in his welcome address that his agency had conducted various studies on the application of nuclear technology in various fields such as safety, environment, industry and manufacturing.
safe,The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and Kairos Power have signed a Technology Investment Agreement to implement an Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) risk reduction award, for which the company was selected in December 2020, to support the design, construction, and commissioning of the Hermes demonstration reactor in Oak Ridge, Tenn.Under the agreement, DOE will provide up to $303 million to Kairos Power using a performance-based, fixed-price milestone approach. The the company will receive fixed payments upon demonstrating it has achieved significant project milestones.The contracting method has been used by the Department of Defense and follows the significant precedent in NASAs successful Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program. It has proven to be a flexible and effective model to support the development and demonstration of complex technologies through federal partnerships with commercial companies.Mike Laufer, Kairos Power co-founder and CEO said in a press statement, With the use of fixed-price milestone payments, this innovative contract provides real benefits to both Kairos Power and DOE to ensure the successful completion of the Hermes reactor. It allows us to remain focused on achieving the most important goals of the project while retaining agility and flexibility to move quickly as we learn key lessons through our iterative development approach.Emphasizing the importance of the contract award, Dr. Kathryn Huff, Assistant Secretary, Office of Nuclear Energy, said in a press statement, The Hermes reactor is an important step toward realizing advanced nuclear energys role in ushering forward the nations clean energy transition, said Partnerships like this one play a significant role in making advanced nuclear technology commercially competitive.On its website the firm said it has since being selected for the ARDP award, Kairos Power has made steady progress on its pathway to demonstration, standing up extensive testing and manufacturing infrastructure to deliver the Engineering Test Unit series and advancing its fuel and molten salt coolant workstreams.In December 2023, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued a construction permit to Kairos Power for the Hermes demonstration reactor. Hermes will demonstrate the companys ability to deliver clean, safe, and affordable nuclear heat and represents a critical step on Kairos Powers iterative pathway to commercializing its advanced reactor technology.(NucNet) AtkinsRalis and state-owned Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) have signed a memorandum of understanding to collaborate on deploying Candu nuclear power reactors around the world. The MOU will be followed by collaboration and licensing agreements that will accelerate the development of Candu reactor technology, including the large-scale1,000 MW Monark designthat was unveiled in November 2023.AtkinsRalis, a Montreal-based nuclear technology and engineering company that is part of Canadas SNC-Lavalin Group, told NucNet it is aiming to deploy its firstMonark nuclear plantin Canada by about 2034-2035 and is targeting markets as far afield as South America, Asia and Australia.CANDU reactor technology was developed in Canada in the 1950s and 1960s by a partnership that included AECL. According to the Canadian Nuclear Associations website, there are 34 Candu plants globally, 30 of which are operable. Nineteen of those plants are in Canada with the rest in Argentina, China, India, Pakistan, Romania and South Korea.AtkinsRalis said as the original equipment manufacturer and steward of CANDU technology, it partners with a nationwide nuclear supply chain of more than 250 companies that employ 76,000 people and provides fuel, components, services and tooling.The Monark, at 1,000 MW, is the most advanced reactor design with the highest output of any CANDU technology. AtkinsRalis said large-scale nuclear reactors are increasingly sought-after by utilities and governments as they look to decarbonize power grids, produce stable baseload power that is not weather-dependent and increase energy security.In September, the Canadian government agreed to provide export financing to support complet4ion of two CANDU reactors in Romania. These additional plants at the Cernavoda site would take nuclear powers share of Romanias electricity production to 36%.The Indian government is in talks with Reliance Industries, Tata Power, Adani Power, and Vedanta Ltd to invest nearly $5.30 billion each from them. The report, quoting two sources, mentioned the Department of Atomic Energy and the state-run Nuclear Power Corp. of India (NPCIL) have held multiple rounds of discussions with private companies in the past year on the investment plan. The government hopes to build 11,000 megawatts (MW) of new nuclear power generation capacity by 2040.This is the first time India is pursuing private investment in nuclear power. The funding would help India achieve its target of having 50% of its installed electric generation capacity use non-fossil fuels by 2030, up from 42% now.The government is asking the private companies will make investments in the nuclear plants, acquire land and water, and undertake construction in areas outside the reactor complex of the plants. However, the responsibility and rights to build and run the power stations and their fuel management will rest with NPCIL. However, the private companies are expected to earn revenue from the power plants electricity sales, and NPCIL would operate the projects for a fee.According to a Reuters wire service report, in August 2023, Minister of State Jitendra Singh also told the countrys parliament that the government was considering options for small modular reactors, and looking at ways to allow the participation of the private sector and start-ups in such projects.India is currently building a fleet of 10 700 MW PHWR nuclear power plants using a 100% India supply chain for the domestic designed CANDU type reactor. Anther seven units are planned once the first ten are complete. India has blocked foreign direct investment in its nuclear sector by passing a supplier liability law that blocks all but state owned enterprises that self-insure. Westinghouse and GE Hitachi exited the market as a resultRussia has built and commissioned two 1000 MW VVER reactors at Kudankulam in Tamil Nadu, is building two more, and has recently completed discussions with NPCIL for a third pair at the same site. Efforts by Frances EDF to build six 1650 MW EPRs at Jaitapur on Indias west coast have been stalled for more than a decade over objections by NPCIL about costs.At $6,000/Mw the two EPR reactors would cost almost $20 billion. By comparison, India claims to be building its 700 MW PHWRs for about half that amount or about $2 billion each. Roughly speaking, India could build its entire fleet of 10 PHWRs for the cost of the twin EPRs not counting cost and schedule delays for the EPRs which have a poor track record in terms of project controls.South Korea will invest in developing its the small modular reactor (SMR) foundry business. President Yoon Suk Yeol said at a town hall meeting in Changwon that the government will develop the southeastern city ofChangwonand its surrounding area South Gyeongsang Province into an SMR manufacturing hub.Changwon will see the countrys new SMR cluster, trade, industry and energy minister Ahn Duk-geun said at the presidents town hall meeting. The city is full of companies with superb nuclear power equipment manufacturing capabilities.Since SMRs are expected to be manufactured and installed in modular forms, the plan is to produce them at factories. Given the limited number of countries with nuclear reactor manufacturing technology, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said the government will step up policy efforts to take the lead in the SMR market.The government significantly increases the budget to develop and export small modular reactors by 2028 by more than nine times to about $49 billion this year. It plans to launch South Korean SMRs in the global market. South Korea has several PWR type designs for SMRs that are in the development stage. It is also a possibility that South Korean heavy industry firms may license SMR designs already or nearly complete in other countries.The government will also offer tax benefits to SMR and nuclear power plant manufacturers. The trade ministry estimates that such tax benefits will lead to an increase in R&D spending and facility investment in the sector by more than $750 million this year alone.The government has earmarked $3 billion for next-generation nuclear power plant R&D through 2027 when President Yoons five-year term ends. This year, the government also plans to draw up a mid- to long-term policy roadmap to support the nuclear energy sector, upon legislation of the special act for the nuclear power industry.Rolls-Royce has been promoting its 470 MW PWR type mid-size reactor as a solution to the nations energy needs. The firm has presented a plans for 16 of them to be built at various sites around the nation.However, the process to select which model of small nuclear reactor, among a field of six competitors, is used in Britain has been beset by delays. Bureaucratic disputes about funding and policy issues has tied up a plan to make multiple awards of significant funding for SMRs. A prior SMR competition in 2015 ended without any significant awards of funding.As a result of the current delays,Tufan Erginbilgic, CEO at Rolls-Royce, says that the first Rolls-Royce mini nuclear reactor will be built in Europe instead of Britain if UK ministers continue on a path of failure to make up their minds about SMRs.Erginbilgic said he was confident the companys small modular reactor (SMR) technology was still far ahead of competitors. He told the Telegraph newspaper that time was running out for the UK to benefit from its first mover advantage, as Rolls has also held talks about deploying SMRs in eastern Europe.His claims about market advantage in Poland, Romania, and other countries need to be taken with grain or two of salt as several other firms including GE-Hitachi and NuScale, among others, have made inroads in developing sale prospects with these nations.Erginbilgics complaints come asGreat British Nuclear(GBN), the public body set up to lead the UKs nuclear power revival, is preparing to choose which SMR prototypes to support from a shortlist of six companies, including Rolls-Royce. GBN had promised to make the awards this spring, but that date is now in doubt according to news reports.In the UK, the company is the only SMR developer to have reached the second stage of the new generic design assessment process for nuclear reactors, with CEO Erginbilgic arguing this puts it in pole position in the GBN competition.Westinghouse Electric Company announced the signing of a contract with the Dutch government to conduct a Technical Feasibility Study (TFS) assessing the deployment of AP1000 reactors in support of their nuclear new-build strategy.This comprehensive study will evaluate deployment of two AP1000 nuclear reactors at theBorssele Nuclear Power Station. The TFS represents a significant step forward in the countrys strategy to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, aligning with the European Unions climate goals and the Dutch commitment to carbon-neutral electricity production by 2035.Borssele, in the province of Zeeland in the southwest of the Netherlands, is the countrys only commercial nuclear power station. It has a single 482-MW pressurized water reactor unit that began commercial operation in 1973. In December 2022 the Dutch government chose the Borssele site as its preferred location for the proposed construction of two new nuclear power reactor units. The government is also considering reactors from Frances EDF, South Koreas KHNP, and Westinghouse. Reactors from Russia or China are not under consideration.(NucNet) The construction of the first phase of China National Nuclear Corporations Jinqimen nuclear power station has officially begun in Zhejiang province, eastern China. The Jinqimen-1 and -2 project will have two indigenous Hualong One, or HPR1000 pressurized water reactor units.Hualong One (HPR 1000) is the 3rd-generation nuclear power brand to which China has exclusive intellectual property rights. HPR 1000 is jointly developed by the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) and the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN).It has a 177 assembly core design with an 18-month refuelling cycle with 4.45% enriched fuel. The power plants utilization rate is as high as 90%. CNNC has said its active and passive safety systems, double-layer containment and other technologies meet the highest international safety standards.Chinese state owned news media reports are that all core components are manufactured in China and that 17 universities and research institutions, 58 state-owned enterprises, and over 140 private firms across China worked on Hualong Ones development to ensure all core components were able to be produced domesticallyThe Kairos reactor is pushing-the-envelope in a whole host of technical, safety, and operational areas. The economics of the approach cannot be evaluated owing to the very high levels of uncertainty just noted.I cannot help but suspect this is yet another example of a heavily taxpayer funded DOE research effort unlikely to succeed in the commercial marketplace. The cost of the long-line of earlier DOE misadventures is in the ten-of-billions of dollars. Perhaps the scientists should take a more pragmatic approach.If you have an experience or insight to share or have learned something from a conference or seminar, your peers and colleagues on Energy Central want to hear about it. It's also easy to share a link to an article you've liked or an industry resource that you think would be helpful.
safe,The then-Labor leader's courageous plan to overhaul negative gearing, capital gains tax and franking credit rules, helped Scott Morrison win the "unwinnable" election. It led to a consensus that oppositions were better off playing it safe on policy and instead trying to win votes by keeping the focus on government failures.Two weeks ago, when the prime minister first announced his broken promise on Stage 3, Dutton demanded an early election. Liberal MPs variously described Labor's re-jigged tax cuts as class warfare, regressive, shameful, inflationary, and Marxist economics (as the prime minister gleefully listed yesterday).Dutton had little choice but to back in the bigger tax cuts for low-and-middle-income earners. And he managed to avoid a damaging internal row over the capitulation. His colleagues largely agreed this was the least bad option.A handful of Liberals would have preferred to "stand and have a fight" rather than "roll over and get smashed in Question Time", as one disappointed MP privately put it, but this would have given the government exactly what it wanted: a drawn-out fight in which the Coalition would be belted for standing in the way of cost-of-living support.To keep faith with those disappointed at the Coalition running up the white flag, Dutton insisted he's still committed to the "principles" of the original Stage 3 plan. That means greater tax relief for those earning more than $146,000 a year, who receive less under Labor's changes.As the Opposition Leader acknowledges, returning the full amount to those at the top would cost around $9 billion a year. Even returning a significant chunk will require potentially unpopular spending cuts elsewhere if the Coalition doesn't want to blow the budget.The Opposition Leader has already pledged to reverse Labor's tax hike for big superannuation accounts. From mid-next year, earnings on super balances of more than $3 million will be taxed at 30 per cent rather than 15 per cent. Reinstating the more generous tax rate will cost the Coalition around $2 billion a year.There's strong support in the opposition to lift the ban on nuclear power in Australia, but given the costs involved, it may take more than that for nuclear to become a viable alternative to renewables.The details of the Coalition's policy are yet to come, but Shadow Minister for Climate Change and Energy Ted O'Brien has raised the prospect of taxpayer-subsidised nuclear reactors. "There's no doubt that you need government involved," he says.The Nationals, who this week have been pushing for a blanket suspension of wind and solar projects in regional areas, are most gung-ho about the nuclear alternative. Liberals (who need to hold and win back urban seats) aren't exactly rushing to back the idea of a renewables ban, suggesting the old Coalition wars over climate and energy policy, on show in Monday night's second episode of the ABC docuseries Nemesis, aren't entirely resolved.The Coalition is also talking tough on industrial relations, suggesting the government's changes on multi-employer bargaining, labour hire, right of entry provisions, and casual employees are holding back the economy.Whether all this talk results in genuine campaign bravery from Peter Dutton is yet to be seen. We may end up with modest proposals, a small target strategy, and an effort to keep the focus on Anthony Albanese's "lies".But if the Opposition leader does go the election promising significant tax cuts for the top, sweeping spending cuts, subsidised nuclear power, and an industrial relations roll back, we could be in for quite a policy contest.
safe,Its been close to 40 years since more than 100,000 people were evacuated from the area surrounding Chernobyl, and while that region is still considered inhospitable to human beings, the wolves that call it home have apparently developed a very intriguing trait.As you likely know, the meltdown that struck Chernobyl in 1986 is considered the worst incident in the history of nuclear energy due to the ramifications that couldve been much, much worse if the Soviets hadnt scrambled to address the deadly threats that stemmed from their own bureaucratic incompetence.The official death toll for the disaster sits at 30 due to people who perished after being exposed to lethal levels of radiation, although it is believed thousands more have or will eventually pass away from cancer that can be traced back to the fallout of what unfolded at the power plant.Ukraine is still home to a 1,000-square-mile area known as the Exclusion Zone that humans will be unable to inhabit for at least 3,000 years, and while there was a mass culling of animals in the region following the disaster, plenty of wildlife eventually made its way back into the impacted woodlands.That includes the mutant wolves that have attracted the interest of scientists whove spent decades conducting Chernobyl-adjacent researchincluding Cara Love, an evolutionary biologist at Princeton who was part of a team that managed to affix collars to the animals in 2014 to measure the levels of radiation theyre exposed to.According to Sky News, the data shows the wolves are subjected to 11.28 millirem of radiation on a daily basis, which the outlet notes is six times the level that is deemed safe for humans. You might assume that would result in a proliferation of cancer in the population, but it appears the animals have adapted to their hostile environment.Love said her research shows the wolves have not only developed altered immune systems similar to cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment but that blood tests she and her team have run have detected genetic mutations that appear to reduce the risk of cancer.Theres hope that theyll be able to use the evidence theyve obtained to further work concerning cancer prevention and treatment in humans, so its good to hear something positive could possibly come out of an otherwise disastrous situation.
safe,Nearly 700 employees at the Columbia Fuel Fabrication Facility, located 25 minutes southeast of Columbia, South Carolina, are set to vote on whether to form a union represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW). The election is scheduled for Feb. 29, March 1 and March 2.The IBEW filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) late last month requesting a union election. More than half of 673 eligible employees have already signed cards pledging to support the organizing drive, HuffPost has learned. The plant has a total workforce of nearly 900.The union push marks the second attempt in the past few years to rally the plants workers to collectively bargain a contract. That the facility isnt already unionized is rather unusual for the nuclear power industry.Just 6% of employees in the U.S. private sector are represented by unions. But more than a third of workers in the nuclear energy industry are organized, according to a 2017 survey conducted by the IBEW, resulting in wages that typically exceed those in renewable energy or fossil fuels. That number has stayed mostly flat  or possibly declined  as nuclear power plants shut down in recent years and laid off workers. But South Carolina has long had the lowest rate of unionization in the nation  a streak U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data confirmed again last month  thanks to laws that favor employers over workers.The factory is one of three owned by the Pennsylvania-based nuclear giant Westinghouse Electric Company, but the only one without a unionized workforce. The other two fuel-fabrication facilities are in England and Sweden.But organized labor bookends the U.S. supply chain. The Blairsville, Pennsylvania, factory where Westinghouse churns out the parts the workers in South Carolina are using to assemble the fuel rods is a union plant. That fuel often ends up in reactors operated by union workers at the federally-owned Tennessee Valley Authoritys fleet of nuclear power plants.As a union member, I take pride knowing that the fuel rods we load into our core at Watts Bar have been touched by union members at the beginning of the process, Trip Geiger, an IBEW-represented assistant reactor operator at the Watts Bar nuclear plant in Tennessee, said in a promotional video the union made to boost the organizing drive in South Carolina. Id like to be able to say theyre touched at the middle of the process, from production to assembly at your plant to installing those same fuel rods in our core and producing power.Following decades of static demand as nuclear energy fell into decline, the U.S. is inching toward building more reactors at home and overseas as the world races to wean off fossil fuels and find alternatives to solar and wind power that use less land and minerals  and produce much steadier and higher volumes of electricity.The U.S. is even challenging Moscows near-monopoly on exports of nuclear technology and uranium, with Westinghouse now manufacturing fuel rods that work in the Russian-designed reactors used widely in Eastern Europe.What I try to tell people at the plant is now would be the time to organize because we certainly have the upper hand, said the worker, who spoke to HuffPost on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal from management. This isnt an industry where you can just hire anybody to replace people, it takes training.The Columbia Fuel Fabrication Facility first attempted to unionize decades ago. Employees there most recently made an organizing push in 2018, a year after Westinghouse  then owned by the Japanese industrial giant Toshiba  filed for bankruptcy amid mounting billion-dollar cost overruns on a project to build the first of a new kind of reactor at a power plant in Georgia.At the time, older workers at the facility worried the organizing drive would cost them their retirement plans. The IBEW only takes on campaigns if the 10% of the workforce inside the facility volunteer to help organize the rest of the company, a threshold the union said the Westinghouse plant failed to reach until last spring.But workers soon saw their pensions werent safe anyway. Westinghouse eliminated employee pensions as part of its financial restructuring, and workers saw that was much easier to do in South Carolina than at the plant in Blairsville.After the failed unionization effort six years ago, Westinghouse began implementing draconian shift schedules and forcing employees to work seven days in a row to benefit from overtime on weekends, according to the IBEW and the worker HuffPost interviewed. Workers typically earn high salaries, they said. However, the health insurance changed to one that provided less coverage. When teams at the plant asked the company to hire more workers to help with the growing demand, the employee said management rebuffed the request, saying there wasnt enough money.Its funny, the amount of money that I see them waste on projects that dont work out or were totally wrong from the state, it might be $100,000 or more and nobody bats an eye at that, the worker said. But if you ask for more time off or say, Hey, we can use a few more people to help lighten the load, its, We cant do that, we dont have the money to do that.HR didnt have to show up every day. The front office didnt have to show up every day. But they sure did, she said of the industrial workers at the plant. So it really empowered them and made them realize, This place doesnt run without us. They cant survive without us.In a speech, two days after the union filed paperwork with the NLRB, Republican Gov. Henry McMaster said, One thing we do not need is more labor unions in the state, according to the South Carolina Daily Gazette, which first reported on the petition last week.McMaster was referring to an ongoing legal fight with the International Longshoremens Association over securing union contracts for crane operators at the Port of Charleston. Asked by the nonprofit news outlet about the Westinghouse campaign, a spokesperson for the GOP governor said all unions represent a clear danger to our prosperity. (Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is running for the Republican presidential nomination in part on her union-busting record.)But Westinghouse paid its former top executive Daniel Roderick $19 million the year before he was pushed out of his seat as chairman of the board amid the companys previous financial collapse in 2017. Westinghouse emerged from Chapter 11 protections in 2018 when Toshiba sold the company to the private equity giant Brookfield.In 2022, a joint venture between the Canadian uranium-mining behemoth Cameco and Brookfield Renewable Partners, a subsidiary of the private equity firm that owns zero-carbon energy assets, bought Westinghouse in what was widely seen as a bullish bet on the future of nuclear power. The deal closed in November.Since then, anytime the managers provide an update on the companys finances at all-hands meetings, the fuel-fabrication division is always in the green while the other services Westinghouse provides are usually in the yellow or red, the longtime South Carolina facility worker said.Our plant especially is the money maker for Westinghouse. Weve been told that for years, that our plant almost single-handedly keeps Westinghouse afloat, the worker said. The fact is, they need us right now.At HuffPost, we believe that everyone needs high-quality journalism, but we understand that not everyone can afford to pay for expensive news subscriptions.

safe,The National Rally Against Reckless Renewables is on the first sitting day of Parliament, Tuesday, 6th February 2024, at 10am in front of Parliament House. This peaceful rally is grassroots, representing many diverse regional communities who are directly and adversely affected by the Australian Governments reckless rollout of renewables. We urge the Federal and State Governments to cease their reckless rollout of unreliable, unaffordable, and environmentally destructive wind, solar, limited firming batteries, and high-voltage transmission lines, amidst an ever-increasing demand for reliable electricity.Currently, there are over 1000 new renewable projects in the governments Powering Our Nation pipeline (Source AEMO, 2023). Almost all of these are located in Regional Australia. In the lead-up to most of these projects, this government has conducted short, insincere, and unacknowledged community consultation. Exploiting the fact that most of these projects are located in or near coastal, farming, and traditional communities with small populations, the government continues to disregard our concerns. In many cases, our right to judicial review or appeal has or will be removed.Australian consumers, taxpayers, and industries require an electricity network that is efficient, safe, reliable, secure, and affordable. It is critical for Australia, now and in the future, to establish a network that does not damage our unique environment, particularly productive agricultural land, fisheries, and native habitats.This governments reckless rollout of renewables poses a significant threat to our nation, threatening food production for Australians and 80 million consumers globally. Our fauna and flora are facing unprecedented destruction, as hundreds of thousands of hectares of land and ocean floors are being deforested and/or damaged. It is posing a threat to our economy, costing over $121 billion (AEMO, 2023). There are documented serious supply chain and sustainment issues, and therefore reliability risks, potentially leading to mass blackouts. Massive taxpayer subsidies and electricity bills will flow offshore for decades to the many greenwashed multinationals lined up for these subsidised investments.This rally is a coalition of grassroots community groups united under the National Rational Energy Network. We call upon the Australian Government to:1. Conduct an urgent Senate Inquiry: Establish a Senate Inquiry to scrutinise the technical veracity as well as the excessive economic, social and environmental costs of renewables, and the escalating risks to our national interest and security. This includes reviewing the committed, anticipated, actionable and future projects being fast-tracked by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment, and Water, in particular the Capacity Investment Scheme, Rewiring the Nation, Offshore Wind Projects, and expanding unelected overreaching organisations including the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, Climate Change Authority, Clean Energy Finance Corporation, Australian Energy Market Operator, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, and Clean Energy Council.2. Suspend all renewable energy projects: We call on the Australian Government to convene the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) Energy Council and request all states and territories suspend wind, solar, hydro and associated transmission construction until the above Senate Inquiry reports.3. Lift the ban on nuclear power: Nuclear energy has the lowest overall greenhouse gas emissions of any energy source as a result of its low land footprint, low material usage, and low waste output. The current ban is archaic, restraining Australia from achieving a strong reliable energy future.This is a national grassroots call for a responsible and sustainable approach to our energy future. We urge the Australian government to prioritise the well- being of our environment, communities, and the future of our nation.[10.00am Mr Grant Piper] [10.10am Ms Gemma Pride] [10.20am Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price] [10.30am Mr Craig Kelly] [10.40am Senator Ralph Babet] [10.50am Senator Ross Cadell] [11.00am Hon Barnaby Joyce MP] [11.10am The Hon Dr David Gillespie MP] [11.20 Senator the Hon.

Aboriginals speaking about desecration of sacred land during the building wind turbines are about as welcome in Aussie mainstream media as black power people supporting Trump are in the US mainstream media.Jacinta Price is one of Australias star politicians. She and her mother Bess Price (and families) are from Alice Springs and deserve high-praise for standing resolutely on principles that have nothing to do with race.No Bill, Jacinta is an evil Alt White and does not correctly represent the traditional owners who have had 100,000 years of perfect harmony on this continent which clearly involved sustainable farming in large permanent towns and had nothing to do with killing off all the megafauna and/or burning down so much of the forests that the rainfall patterns changed. Clearly.Did we get the Completely Unrelated Third Party Who No One Has Heard Of Before Or Invited that can march up in neo 1930s Euro cosplay and decisively prove to the MSM that the entire rally was funded by. (gasp) the Alt Right!! ?5- 30 meters deep) sea sponge. (A meaning from a limited sampled area a small part part of, NOT the whole Caribbean. My beach collected sponge spicules are all shallow origin.) Down where we already know thermocline temperatures are affected by ocean currents. And where we also know sea sponge spicule chemistry is at best a sketchy proxy for temperature alonewhich is why previously sea sponges almost never were used before as a temp proxy. Not even by Mann, Marcott, or Pages2.Novel but sketchy narrow geographic proxy extrapolated to usual alarmist global result. Very climate sciency. Alarmists are now probably scraping the bottom of their rotten climate science Apple barrel.The net zero agenda is so farcical it might be prudent to bring along a troop of clowns, comedians and cartoonists who are best able to explain and depict the logic of the government programs for net zero.I contributed to one of their meetings, they were talking about amalgamating into a single organisation, and I suggested not to. I said whoever is head of that organisation will make themselves a target, that a brush fire is the hardest kind of fire to fight, because there is no single place our opponents can focus to put it out.Naturally theyre getting the silent treatment from mainstream media, or when mentioned are dismissed as cranks and extremists, but their demands are actually quite moderate. For example, though some are totally against renewables, many of the participants are OK with powerlines being built, but they want them built underground, where they wont bother anyone.I contributed to one of their meetings, they were talking about amalgamating into a single organisation, and I suggested not to.

Well Im a part of that grass roots movement and trust me it has grown substantially over the past five years to well over a hundred different groups. What people forget is that Australia is a huge continent with a relatively small population so we are never going to be able to hold rallies like those in Europe. They are geographically small countries with large populations.There were attendees from parts of Queensland, Victoria and South Australia which means they travelled there by plane most likely. Those from within NSW would still have had many hours of driving to get to Canberra as well as one or two nights accommodation. My point is that to attend the rally was costly and took valuable time out of a farmers work schedule. We were impressed with the attendance of the people who put in so much valuable time, effort and personal expense to get the attention of the politicians on their first day back in parliament.Getup, which is along the same lines as the Antifa dress up crowd, tried to intimidate us with a flood of messages stating that they would effectively take over the rally with their presence and were asking their supporters for $12 donations towards signs that would outnumber ours at the rally. No one turned up! Then they had the gall to put out a message that theyd basically shut us down. All lies! We experienced none of the opposition we had expected.We had amazing support from politicians speaking up for us as well as farmers and others from the regions who spoke really well. Peter Ridd spoke too, a name that you would all be familiar with. The government now know that there is considerable opposition to their renewables plan. And as we are many groups united it will not be easy for them to shut us down.
safe,Celeste Wallander, assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, told Clifford May, president of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, that U.S. aid to Ukraine has global impacts.Russia invaded neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 22, 2021. Russian forces were larger and better equipped, but Ukrainian forces stopped them from capturing the capital of Kyiv and decapitating the government and installing a puppet regime that answered to Russian President Vladimir Putin.The United States has provided $43 billion in support to Ukraine, covering everything from Javelin missiles to tanks to ambulances to long-range strike missiles to air defense capabilities and much, much more. U.S. service members are training Ukrainian forces in Europe and the United States. Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III formed and still leads the Ukraine Defense Security Group which now has 50 nations that contribute to Ukraine's defense.This aid is key to helping Ukrainian forces take on and, in many areas, push back the Russians. U.S. government officials said in January that more than 300,000 Russians have been killed or wounded in Ukraine.Wallander said the United States wants a Ukraine that is sovereign, independent and secure, adding that the Ukrainian people do not want Russian overlords and are fighting for their freedom. "We want the Ukrainian people to be able to live the European life they have chosen," she said during the discussion.While supporting Ukraine is the right thing to do, U.S. support is about more than just Ukraine, Wallander said. "[Our support] is about the international order that keeps all countries and all populations safe, including Russia," she said.Built into the fabric of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is the agreement that nuclear powers will respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of other countries and agree to support the peaceful use of nuclear energy for their prosperity. "All of that is at stake in Russia's invasion and occupation of Ukraine," she said.                Army Sgt. Alejandro Anguiano, a loader assigned to Bravo Barbarian Company, 2nd Battalion, 69th Armored Regiment Panther Battalion, 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division supporting NATOs enhanced Forward Presence Battle Group Poland, boresights the M1A2 Abrams main gun during Exercise Iron Spear in Adazi, Latvia, Nov. 13, 2023. Iron Spear included a firepower demonstration involving troops from Canada, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the U.S. The 3rd Infantry Divisions mission in Europe is to engage in multinational training and exercises across the continent, working alongside NATO allies and regional security partners to provide combat-credible forces to V Corps, Americas forward deployed corps in Europe.China has supported Russia in its illegal invasion, and the Asian nation has benefited from Russia's increasing isolation. "The Chinese leadership doesn't want Putin to lose, because of what that would mean about the strength of the international community in pushing back against a bully," she said.Beyond the geopolitical reasons for supporting Ukraine, there are very human reasons, as well. The Russian invasion has been incredibly brutal, with indiscriminate attacks on civilians throughout the country. Wallander noted that Russian brutality has not been limited to Ukraine. The Russian military has used the same tactics in Chechnya and Georgia.But in Ukraine, Russia has gone beyond merely targeting civilian infrastructure. Russia has been taking Ukrainian children from their families or taking orphans and sending them to Russia. It is an almost "Nazi-like idea of ethnic purity that they need to be educated as Russians and that they are somehow going to be re-educated and brought back to benefit the Russian Federation," Wallander said. "It is just astonishing to think that a Europe, which faced the horror of such a leadership doing that to populations in the 1940s, is now confronted with another leadership that is doing that  in the 2020s."

Follow us on InstagramandTwitter and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.Feel free to repost and share widely Global Research articles.For a couple of decades now, the very worst people in Washington, D.C., have pushed hard for a war on Iran. Some high points have come in 2007, 2015, 2017, and 2024. Each time it has been absolutely critical to attack Iran at once. There could be no delay. Dominoes would fall. Terrorism would prevail. Credibility would be sqandered. And yet, each time, the threatened war has not been launched, and the world has gone on just the same.Weve seen a wide variety of excuses deployed over these years of unsuccessful propaganda for a war on Iran, including false claims about nuclear weapons, the pretense that attacking Iran would improve civil liberties within Iran, and shockingly honest commitments to gaining control of more oil with which to slowly destroy the habitability of the Earth. The push to attack Iran has been on for so long that entire categories of arguments for it (such as that the Iranians are fueling the Iraqi resistance) and demonized leaders of Iran have come and gone. The latest excuse is the killing of three members of the U.S. military.Ordinarily, killing people could be prosecuted as a crime. But thats tricky, because the United States government opposes and refuses to take part in international law, the U.S. troops had no legal justification for being where they were, and the violence across the region is being driven by U.S. support for enormous crimes by the Israeli government.More importantly, the advocates for war do not want to prosecute a crime, but to use a crime as an excuse to commit much larger crimes, on the familiar model of September 11, October 7, etc. The choice to escalate is not imposed on anyone; similar situations in the past have been used as excuses for war and also allowed to pass without the launching of any war.The U.S. government purports to believe that escalating wars will reduce wars, flying in the face of the overwhelming evidence of centuries, and to believe that there is no alternative, even though the demands of all sorts of warmakers across Western Asia are all the same and extremely easy to satisfy (and satisfying them has been ordered by the International Court of Justice): stop destroying Gaza and killing Gazans.The U.S. government distorts the notion of defense beyond all recognition by claiming that harm done to its imperial troops anywhere on Earth can justify a defensive war. This is highly convenient for war hawks in Washington, D.C., who have known for many years that getting U.S. troops killed can be a big propaganda boost for war madness  an idea eagerly encouraged today by U.S. media outlets that are always perfectly capable of demanding revenge while simulaneously calling it defense.This is what the empire of U.S. military bases looks like to Iran. Try to imagine if you lived there, what you would think of this. Who is threatening whom? Who is the greater danger to whom? The point is not that Iran should be free to attack the United States or anyone else because its military is smaller. The point is that doing so would be national suicide. It would also be something Iran has not done for centuries. But it would be typical U.S. behavior.The U.S. overthrew Irans democracy in 1953 and installed a brutal dictator / weapons customer. The U.S. gave Iran nuclear energy technology in the 1970s. Following the Iranian revolution, the United States aided Iraq in the 1980s in attacking Iran, providing Iraq with some of the weapons (including chemical weapons) that were used on Iranians and that would be used in 2002-2003 (when they no longer existed) as an excuse for attacking Iraq.The roots of a Washington push for a new war on Iran can be found in the 1992 Defense Planning Guidance, the 1996 paper called A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm, the 2000 Rebuilding Americas Defenses, and in a 2001 Pentagon memo described by Wesley Clark as listing these nations for attack: Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Lebanon, Syria, and Iran. Its worth noting that Bush Jr. overthrew Iraq, and Obama Libya, while the others remain works in progress. The arguments in these old forgotten memos were not what the war makers tell the public, but much closer to what they tell each other. The concerns were those of dominating regions rich in resources, intimidating others, and establishing bases from which to maintain control of puppet governments.In 2000, the CIA gave Iran nuclear bomb plans in an effort to frame it. This was reported by James Risen, and Jeffrey Sterling went to prison for allegedly being Risens source. But nobody involved in the scheme was ever punished in any way.In 2010, Tony Blair included Iran on a list of countries that he said Dick Cheney had aimed to overthrow. The line among the powerful in Washington in 2003 was that Iraq would be a cakewalk but that real men go to Tehran.For many years, the United States has labeled Iran an evil nation, attacked and destroyed the other non-nuclear nation on the list of evil nations, designated part of Irans military a terrorist organization, falsely accused Iran of crimes including the attacks of 9-11, murdered Iranian scientists, funded opposition groups in Iran (including some the U.S. also designates as terrorist), flew dronesover Iran, openly and illegally threatened to attack Iran, and built up military forces all around Irans borders, while imposing cruel sanctions on the country. The long history of the United States lying about Iranian nuclear weapons is chronicled by Gareth Porters book Manufactured Crisis.In 2007, we were told that Iran needed to be attacked urgently due to false claims about nuclear weapons. Even a National Intelligence Estimate in 2007 pushed back and admitted that Iran had no nuclear weapons program.In 2015, Republicans urged war justified by Irans nuclear weapons program, while Democrats successfully moved for passage of an agreement with Iran, also justified by Irans nuclear weapons program. The agreement was not a treaty, and President Trump would later throw it out. But the damage of both sides falsely claiming that Iran had a nuclear weapons program was done.Dick and Liz Cheneys book, Exceptional, tell us we must see a moral difference between an Iranian nuclear weapon and an American one. Must we, really? Either risks further proliferation, accidental use, use by a crazed leader, mass death and destruction, environmental disaster, retaliatory escalation, and apocalypse. One of those two nations has nuclear weapons, has used nuclear weapons, has provided the other with plans for nuclear weapons, has a policy of first-use of nuclear weapons, has leadership that sanctions the possession of nuclear weapons, and has frequently threated to use nuclear weapons. I dont think those facts would make a nuclear weapon in the hands of the other country the least bit moral, but also not the least bit more immoral. Lets focus on seeing an empiricaldifference between an Iranian nuclear weapon and an American one. One exists. The other doesnt.If youre wondering, U.S. presidents who have made specific public or secret nuclear threats to other nations, that we know of, as documented in Daniel Ellsbergs The Doomsday Machine, have included Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump, while others, including Barack Obama and Donald Trump have frequently said things like All options are on the table in relation to Iran or another country.Proponents of war or steps toward war (sanctions was a step toward the war on Iraq) say we urgently need a war on Iran now, but they have no argument for urgency, and theyve been making the same argument with ever less credibility for years.The Trump White House early on openly expressed a desire to claim that Iran had violated the 2015 nuclear agreement, but produced no evidence. It didnt matter. Trump tore up the agreement anyway and used his own shredding of the agreement as grounds for nuclear fearmongering about Iran.In 2017, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations claimed that Iranian weapons had been used in a war that the U.S.., Saudi Arabia, and allies were illegally and disastrously waging in Yemen. While thats a problem that should be corrected, it is hard to find a war anywhere on the planet without U.S. weapons in it. In fact, a report that made news the same day as the ambassadors claims, pointed to the long-known fact that many of the weapons used by ISIS had once belonged to the United States, many of them having been given by the U.S. to non-state fighters (aka terrorists) in Syria.Fighting wars and arming others to fight wars/terrorism is a justification for indictment and prosecution, but not for war, legally, morally, or practically. The United States fights and arms wars, and no one would be justified in attacking the United States.If Iran is guilty of a crime, and there is evidence to support that claim, the United States and the world should seek its prosecution. Instead, the United States is isolating itself by tearing down the rule of law.President Biden came into office with the possibility wide open to restore the Iran agreement and pursue a better course. He chose not to do so, and not to even try to do so. He waited for a less amendable government to take power in Iran, and then did seemingly everything he could to stir up hostitlities in the region. Now an agreement looks much more difficult to obtain.Of course the reason why real men go to Tehran is that Iran is not the impoverished disarmed nation that one might find in, say, Afghanistan or Iraq, or even the disarmed nation found in Libya in 2011. Iran is much bigger and much better armed. Whether the United States launches a major assault on Iran or Israel does, Iran will retaliate against U.S. troops and probably Israel and possibly the United States itself as well. And the United States will without any doubt re-retaliate for that. Iran cannot be unaware that the U.S. governments pressure on the Israeli government not to attack Iran consists of reassuring the Israelis that the United States will attack when needed, and does not include even threatening to stop funding Israels military or to stop vetoing measures of accountability for Israeli crimes at the United Nations.Of course, many in the U.S. government and military oppose attacking Iran, although key figures like Admiral William Fallon have been moved out of the way. Much of the Israeli military is opposed as well, not to mention the Israeli and U.S. people. But war is not clean or precise. If the people we allow to run our nations attack another, we are all put at risk.Most at risk, of course, are the people of Iran, people as peaceful as any other, or perhaps more so. As in any country, no matter what its government, the people of Iran are fundamentally good, decent, peaceful, just, and fundamentally like you and me. Ive met people from Iran. You may have met people from Iran. They look like this. Theyre not a different species. Theyre not evil. A surgical strike against a facility in their country would cause a great many of them to die very painful and horrible deaths. Even if you imagine that Iran would not retaliate for such attacks, this is what the attacks would in themselves consist of: mass murder.And what would that accomplish? It would unite the people of Iran and much of the world against the United States. It would justify in the eyes of much of the world an underground Iranian program to develop nuclear weapons, a program that probably does not exist at present, except to the extent that legal nuclear energy programs move a country closer to weapons development. The environmental damage would be tremendous, the precedent set incredibly dangerous, all talk of cutting the U.S. military budget would be buried in a wave of war frenzy, civil liberties and representative government would be flushed down the Potomac, a nuclear arms race would spread to additional countries, and any momentary sadistic glee would be outweighed by accelerating home foreclosures, mounting student debt, and accumulating layers of cultural stupidity.Strategically, legally, and morally weapons possession is not grounds for war, and neither is pursuit of weapons possession. And neither, I might add, with Iraq in mind, is theoretically possible pursuit of weapons never acted upon. Israel has nuclear weapons. The United States has more nuclear weapons than any other country but Russia (the two of them together have 90% of the worlds nukes). There can be no justification for attacking the United States, Israel, or any other country. The pretense that Iran has or will soon have nuclear weapons is, in any case, just a pretense, one that has been revived, debunked, and revived again like a zombie for years and years. But thats not the really absurd part of this false claim for something that amounts to no justification for war whatsoever.The really absurd part is that it was the United States in 1976 that pushed nuclear energy on Iran. In 2000 the CIA gave the Iranian government (slightly flawed) plans to build a nuclear bomb. In 2003, Iran proposed negotiations with the United States with everything on the table, including its nuclear technology, and the United States refused. Shortly thereafter, the United States started angling for a war. Meanwhile, U.S.-led sanctions prevent Iran from developing wind energy, while the Koch brothers are allowed to trade with Iran without penalty.Another area of ongoing lie debunking, one that almost exactly parallels the buildup to the 2003 attack on Iraq, is the relentless false claim, including by candidates in 2012 for U.S. President, that Iran has not allowed inspectors into its country or given them access to its sites. Iran had, in fact, prior to the agreement voluntarily accepted stricter standards than the IAEA requires. And of course a separate line of propaganda, albeit a contradictory one, holds that the IAEA has discovered a nuclear weapons program in Iran. Under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), Iran was not required to declare all of its installations, and early last decade it chose not to, as the United States violated that same treaty by blocking Germany, China, and others from providing nuclear energy equipment to Iran. While Iran remains in compliance with the NPT, India and Pakistan and Israel have not signed it and North Korea has withdrawn from it, while the United States and other nuclear powers continuously violate it by failing to reduce arms, by providing arms to other countries such as India, and by developing new nuclear weapons, not to mention keeping nuclear weapons in six European countries, providing Russia to put them into one European country as well.Are you ready for an even more absurd twist? This is on the same scale as Bushs comment about not really giving much thought to Osama bin Laden. Are you ready? The proponents of attacking Iran themselves admit that if Iran had nukes it would not use them. This is from the American Enterprise Institute:The biggest problem for the United States is not Iran getting a nuclear weapon and testing it, its Iran getting a nuclear weapon and not using it. Because the second that they have one and they dont do anything bad, all of the naysayers are going to come back and say, See, we told you Iran is a responsible power. We told you Iran wasnt getting nuclear weapons in order to use them immediately.  And they will eventually define Iran with nuclear weapons as not a problem.Is that clear? Iran using a nuclear weapon would be bad: environmental damage, loss of human life, hideous pain and suffering, yada, yada, yada. But what would be really bad would be Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon and doing what every other nation with them has done since Nagasaki: nothing. That would be really bad because it would damage an argument for war and make war more difficult, thus allowing Iran to run its country as it, rather than the United States, sees fit. Of course it might run it very badly (although the U.S. is hardly establishing a model for the world over here either), but it would run it without U.S. approval, and that would be worse than nuclear destruction.Inspections were allowed in Iraq and they worked. They found no weapons and there were no weapons. Inspections have been allowed in Iran and have worked. However, the IAEA has come under the corrupting influence of the U.S. government. And yet, the bluster from war proponents about IAEA claims over the years is not backed up by any actual claims from the IAEA. And what little material the IAEA has provided for the cause of war has been widely rejected when not being laughed at.Another year, another lie. No longer do we hear that North Korea is helping Iran build nukes. Lies about Iranian backing of Iraqi resisters have faded. (Didnt the United States back French resistance to Germans at one point?) Another recent concoction is the Iran did 911 lie. Revenge, like the rest of these attempted grounds for war, is actually not a legal or moral justification for war. But the 9/11 fiction has already been put to rest by the indespensable Gareth Porter, among others. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, which did play a role in 911 as well as in the Iraqi resistance, is being sold record quantities of that good old leading U.S. export of which were all so proud: weapons of mass destruction.Oh, I almost forgot another lie that hasnt quite entirely faded yet. Iran did not try to blow up a Saudi ambassador in Washington, D.C., an action which President Obama would have considered perfectly praiseworthy if the roles were reversed, but a lie that even Fox News had a hard time stomaching. And thats saying something.And then theres that old standby: Ahmadinejad said Israel should be wiped off the map. While this does not, perhaps, rise to the level of John McCain singing about bombing Iran or Bush and Obama swearing that all options including nuclear attack are on the table, it sounds extremely disturbing: wiped off the map! However, the translation is a bad one. A more accurate translation was the regime occupying Jerusalem must vanish from the page of time. The government of Israel, not the nation of Israel. Not even the government of Israel, but the current regime. Hell, Americans say that about their own regimes all the time, alternating every four to eight years depending on political party (some of us even say it all the time, without immunity for either party). Iran has made clear it would approve of a two-state solution if Palestinians approved of it. If the U.S. launched missile strikes every time somebody said something stupid, even if accurately translated, how safe would it be to live near Newt Gingrichs or Joe Bidens house?Luckily, war resisters have succeeded for so long (even while telling each other that they never succeed) that the war mongers dont remember who Ahmadinejad even was anymore, and all that demonization has gone to nought.The real danger may not actually be the lies. The Iraq experience has built up quite a mental resistance to these sorts of lies in many U.S. residents. The real danger may be the slow start of a war that gains momentum on its own without any formal announcement of its initiation. Israel and the United States have not just been talking tough or crazy. Theyve been murdering Iranians. And they seem to have no shame about it. The day after a Republican presidential primary debate at which candidates declared their desire to kill Iranians, the CIA apparently made certain the news was public that it was in fact already murdering Iranians, not to mention blowing up buildings. Some would say and have said that the war has already begun. Those who cannot see this because they do not want to see it will also miss the deadly humor in the United States asking Iran to return its brave drone.There was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war. The one that interested me the most was why dont we build  we in our shipyard  build four or five boats that look like Iranian PT boats. Put Navy seals on them with a lot of arms. And next time one of our boats goes to the Straits of Hormuz, start a shoot-up. Might cost some lives. And it was rejected because you cant have Americans killing Americans. Thats the kind of  thats the level of stuff were talking about. Provocation. But that was rejected.Now, Dick Cheney is not your typical American. Nobody in the U.S. government is your typical American. Your typical American is struggling, disapproves of the U.S. government, wishes billionaires were taxed, favors green energy and education and jobs over military boondoggles, thinks corporations should be barred from buying elections, and would not be inclined to apologize for getting shot in the face by the Vice President.Back in the 1930s, the Ludlow Amendment nearly made it a Constitutional requirement that the public vote in a referendum before the United States could go to war. President Franklin Roosevelt blocked that proposal. Yet the Constitution already required and still requires that Congress declare war before a war is fought. That has not been done in almost 80 years, while wars have raged on almost incessantly. In the past decade and right up through President Obamas signing of the outrageous National Defense Authorization Act on New Years Eve 2011-2012, the power to make war has been handed over to presidents. Here is one more reason to oppose a presidential war on Iran: once you allow presidents to make wars, you will never stop them. Another reason, in so far as anybody any longer gives a damn, is that war is a crime. Iran and the United States are parties to the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which bans war. One of those two nations is not complying.But we wont have a referendum. The U.S. House of Misrepresentatives wont step in. Only through widespread public pressure and nonviolent action will we intervene in this slow-motion catastrophe. This war, if it happens, will be fought by an institution called the United States Department of Defense, but it will endanger rather than defending us. As the war progresses, we will be told that the Iranian people want to be bombed for their own good, for freedom, for democracy. But nobody wants to be bombed for that. Iran does not want U.S.-style democracy. Even the United States does not want U.S.-style democracy. We will be told that those noble goals are guiding the actions of our brave troops and our brave drones on the battlefield. Yet there will be no battlefield. There will be no front lines. There will be no trenches. There will simply be cities and towns where people live, and where people die. There will be no victory. There will be no progress accomplished through a surge. On January 5, 2012, then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta was asked at a press conference about the failures in Iraq and Afghanistan, and he replied simply that those were successes. That is the kind of success that could be expected in Iran were Iran a destitute and disarmed state.Now we begin to understand the importance of all the media suppression, blackouts, and lies about the damage done to Iraq and Afghanistan. Now we understand why Obama and Panetta embraced the lies that launched the War on Iraq. The same lies must now be revived, as for every war ever fought, for a War on Iran. Heres a video explaining how this will work, even with some new twistsand lots of variations. The U.S. corporate media is part of the war machine.Planning war and funding war creates its own momentum. Sanctions become, as with Iraq, a stepping stone to war. Cutting off diplomacy leaves few options open. Electoral pissing contests take us allwhere most of us did not want to be.These are the bombs most likely to launch this ugly and quite possibly terminal chapter of human history. This animation shows clearly what they would do. For an even better presentation, pair that with this audio of a misinformed caller trying hopelessly to persuade George Galloway that we should attack Iran.On January 2, 2012, the New York Times reported concern that cuts to the U.S. military budget raised doubts as to whether the United States would be prepared for a grinding, lengthy ground war in Asia. At a Pentagon press conference on January 5, 2012, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff reassured the press corpse (sic) that major ground wars were very much an option and that wars of one sort or another were a certainty. President Obamas statement of military policy released at that press conference listed the missions of the U.S. military. First was fighting terrorism, next detering aggression, then projecting power despite anti-access/area denial challenges, then the good old WMDs, then conquering space and cyberspace, then nuclear weapons, and finally  after all that  there was mention of defending the Homeland Formerly Known As The United States.The cases of Iraq and Iran are not identical in every detail, of course. But in both cases we are dealing with concerted efforts to get us into wars, wars based, as all wars are based, on lies. We may need to revive this appeal to U.S. and Israeli forces!Disclaimer: The contents of this article are of sole responsibility of the author(s).

safe,Researchers have exceeded the current record for generating energy from a nuclear fusion reaction. Its a big step toward solving the world power consumption crisis. Nuclear fusion is called the holy grail of energy production  because it could lead to a virtually unlimited source of safe + sustainable power.The nuclear test happened at the worlds most powerful fusion plant  the JET Fusion facility in the UK.The record-breaking nuclear fusion reaction had a temperature of more than 150 million degrees Celsius, 10 times hotter than the heart of the sun. The research team explained that the breakthrough is a landmark for this technology, and a key step toward developing practical nuclear fusion.Most nuclear reactors use fission  thats when big unstable atoms like uranium are split in two, releasing lots of energy + radiation. Fission is the current technique used around the globe in nuclear power plants. But fusion is different. It involves forcing atoms of hydrogen together  fusing them to create: helium, lots of energy, and just a tiny bit of short-lived radiation.Using fusion to create mini-suns inside reactors like this, is one of the greatest tech challenges humanity has ever faced. It holds the potential for producing almost unlimited supplies of energy, forever. The essential part of the test fusion reaction only lasted for 5 seconds  and only generated enough power to boil about 60 kettles of water  11 mega-watts of power. But its an important proof of the science of fusion.The power output was more than double what was achieved in similar tests in year 1997.Temperatures to produce nuclear fusion need to be extremely high  above 100 million Celsius. No materials exist that can withstand direct contact with such heat. So, to achieve fusion in a lab, scientists invented a solution  super-heated gas (called plasma) is held inside a doughnut shaped magnetic field. In geometry this doughnut shape is called a torus. And objects that have a torus shape are called toroidal. The plasma used in the JET Fusion reactor is hotter than anything in our solar system.Future lab tests will make the plasma from a mix of two forms  called isotopes  of hydrogen. These hydrogen isotopes are called deuterium and tritium. The JET Fusion scientists successfully engineered a lining for the 80 cubic meter toroidal shaped vessel enclosing the magnetic field  that functions efficiently with these isotopes.For its experiments in year 1997  the team used carbon. But carbon absorbs tritium, which is radioactive. So for the recent tests, they constructed new walls for the vessel. The walls are made with the metals beryllium and tungsten. These are 10 times less absorbent. Then the JET Fusion team tuned their plasma to function effectively in this new environment.The current test supports the design of an even bigger fusion reactor being constructed in France. The JET Fusion reactor cant actually run any longer because its copper electro-magnets get too hot. New tests will use internally cooled super-conducting magnets. Nuclear fusion reactions in labs famously consume more energy to launch than they can output  this is called an energy deficit. For example, the JET Fusion lab used two 500 mega-watt flywheels just to power the experiment.But scientists believe this deficit can be overcome. New toroidal vessels are being developed  with a volume thats 10 times bigger than JET Fusions vessel. Ultimately the goal is to build a commercial power plant that can produce more energy than it consumes to operate  so the excess energy canbe fed into electric power grids.Theres still much research + development to do. Possible power plants of the future  based on nuclear fusion instead of nuclear fission  would produce no greenhouse gases and only a small amount of short-lived radioactive waste.The JET Fusion facility is located at the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy  managed by the UK Atomic Energy Authority. International nuclear scientists collaborate at the research center as part of the EURO Fusion consortium  made-up of 4,800 experts.The lab was designed to study nuclear fusion in conditions similar to the specs needed for a real power plant. Its the only lab that can operate with the deuterium-tritium fuel mix thats used for commercial fusion energy. This excellent facility achieves major advances in the science + engineering of fusion. Its success led to the construction of the first commercial-scale nuclear fusion machine  and its scientists have proven the design for future fusion power plants.In this photo you can see the towers of a typical nuclear fission facility that produces electricity  called a power plant. Today there are approx. 440 of these nuclear power reactors operating globally  providing approx. 10 percent of the worlds electricity.The hope of recent nuclear fusion tests is to develop practical techniques to harness energy successfully  paving the way for sustainable fusion power plants of tomorrow. Our current world-wide nuclear energy reactors operate using fission.These vintage systems are not as efficient, and produce toxic by-products. If fission power plants overheat, it spells disaster for human health + habitat. They also produce an enormous amount of radioactive waste thats getting more + more difficult to dispose of  since the radiation decays so slowly that it continues to pose biological + environmental risks long after its passed its usefulness in the reactor.This is a stunning result because they managed to demonstrate the greatest amount of energy output from the fusion reactions of any device in history. The test demonstrated stability of the plasma for over 5 seconds.
safe,Its the coldest time of the year, and the demand for energy is significantly higher as people try to warm their homes. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), in Alabama seven out of ten homes rely on electric heating during the winter months. Increasing demand is placing a strain on our power grid, and the Biden administration has no solution to the problem.Instead of providing families with reliable energy, Joe Biden and his administration have other priorities. Theyve spent the last three years on a crusade to make America dependent on unreliable energy sources such as wind and solar power, all in the name of supposedly fighting climate change. While wind and solar have roles to play in domestic energy production, we simply cannot rely on them. The sun doesnt always shine and the wind doesnt always blow, but our energy grid needs to run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.Despite Joe Bidens best efforts, most of our energy still comes from fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas. Democrats dont like to admit this, but when wind and solar power fail, the backup generators are powered by oil and natural gas. Without fossil fuels, our energy grid and our economy could not function.Right now, nuclear energy accounts for approximately 20% of our power grid, which is more than wind and solar combined. The U.S. has the most nuclear power production of any country in the world, but we could be producing even more. Burdensome regulations and bureaucratic red tape from the Biden administration are slowing down nuclear permitting and production from doing even more.Once again, Democrat politicians would rather play politics than do what is best for the working people of this country. They know their left-wing voter base hates nuclear energyand they wont risk offending them.There is neither an economic nor a scientific basis for opposition to nuclear energy, which is the single most efficient source of energy known to man. It is 8,000 times more efficient than fossil fuelswhich are already much more efficient than wind and solar power. This efficiency grants nuclear power an unparalleled ability to bring down the price of energyand, in turn, reduce prices throughout our economy.Nuclear is also safe for the environment. Nuclear energy produces zero emissions and removes harmful pollutants from the atmosphere. Claims that nuclear energy production is dangerous are simply outdated. After the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, there was a panic among Americans, and the federal government canceled President Nixons goal of building 1,000 nuclear reactors. Despite zero deaths from the Three Mile Island incident, our energy policy has never recovered from this mistake and continues declining with the close of 13 American nuclear reactors since 2013.Scientists are always working to learn from the past and improve our technical knowledge. We know a lot more about nuclear safety now than we did in 1979. Our technology is better than ever and continues to improve each day.Alabama understands this better than almost any state as we are proud to be the nations fifth-largest producer of nuclear energy with two nuclear plants and five nuclear reactors. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) operates Browns Ferry in Athens, Alabama, which is their largest nuclear plant and has the second-largest nuclear power generating capacity in the nation. Browns Ferry directly supports 1,500 Alabama jobs and powers more than two million homes.On the other end of the state, just outside of Dothan, Alabama Power runs Plant Farley, generating nearly 20% of Alabama Powers electricity. Plant Farley supports 900 good jobs in the Wiregrass area, and I am grateful to Alabamas energy workers for keeping the lights on for us.America needs to learn from Alabama. We need to stop the obsession with wind and solar energy and do a better job of investing in nuclear energy. The polls show that a clear majority of the public wants more nuclear powerand that majority is growing by the day. Its good economics. Its good energy policy. Its good environmental policy. And its long overdue.
safe,In the past weeks, the Labour Party has dramatically scaled back its 28 billion green investment plans, while the Conservative government has committed to annual licensing rounds in the North Sea in a new oil and gas bill.Wrangling between the Tories and Labour has also opened the door for fringe political activists. Parties such as Reform UK have exploited mixed messaging over climate policy, which the UN authority on climate science, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, says is essential to secure to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all.The campaign has been overshadowed by the sacking of the frontrunner candidate, Azhar Ali, who was dropped by Labour over his controversial comments about the October 7 Hamas attacks. It is too late for Labour to field another candidate, and Ali will now run as an independent.Simon Danczuk, who is standing for Reform UK, and George Galloway, the candidate for the Workers Party of Britain, have both repeatedly attacked the UKs legally binding net zero targets, while Galloway has spread climate misinformation and backed new fossil fuel extraction.This month Danczuk announced he had joined Reform UK. Danczuk was the MP for Rochdale between 2010 and 2017. He is seeking a return to the constituency following his expulsion from the Labour Party in 2015 after sending sexually explicit messages to a 17-year-old (he served as an independent until 2017).Last June he wrote an article attacking the eco-madness of Labours (now scaled back) green investment plans and its pledge not to approve new oil and gas projects. He wrote that Labour see implementing a green ideology as more important than jobs, security and sustaining the economy.The article was published in Spiked, an online libertarian outlet which has a record of climate science denial and fossil fuel-linked funding. Between 2015 and 2018, Spiked received $300,000 from the Charles Koch Foundation, an arm of oil giant Koch Industries and a major funder of climate denial.Danczuk repeated the green ideology argument in an interview with the fringe right-wing outlet Epoch Times, stating: The idea of banning gas and oil exploration in the North Sea, before weve got alternatives in place, is just absolute madness.In September 2023, Danczuk publicly voiced support for the Conservative governments net zero U-turns, telling TalkTV that voters are very despondent about these targets and that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had called it right. TalkTV has its own record of spreading climate denial, and until last year employed Reform leader Richard Tice as a presenter.Reform is campaigning to scrap all of net zero and received 135,000 in donations from climate deniers and fossil fuel interests in 2023. Tice has said CO2 isnt poison, its plant food, while the partys London mayoral candidate Howard Cox has said man is not responsible for global warming.Another ex-Labour Party MP, George Galloway, is standing for the Workers Party of Britain, a party he founded after the 2019 general election. Galloway was expelled from Labour in 2003 for bringing the party into disrepute after a party tribunal found he had incited Arabs to fight British troops and incited British troops to defy orders. He has since been elected to parliament twice  in 2005 for his Respect party and 2012 as an independent  each time serving one term.The party is hostile to climate policies. Its website calls for a much clearer debate on Net Zero and argues that a halt must also be made to the attempt to make working people pay for subsidies for large-scale green industrialisation.Last July the party called for a Brexit-style referendum on net zero, a policy originally pushed by the right-wing Reform UK and led by its honorary president Nigel Farage. (Galloway and Farage have worked together in the past as part of the Aaron Banks-funded Grassroots Out campaign for Brexit.)Galloway has attacked net zero targets, advocated for clean coal extraction and spread misinformation about climate change.In December, Galloway called for a net zero referendum in a post on the social media platform X. On his YouTube talk show in August 2022, Galloway spread the false claim that people would be forced to eat insects to tackle climate change, adding, I think this net zero is one of the biggest hoaxes in modern politics. He then took a swipe at climate activist Greta Thunberg, a regular target for climate deniers, calling net zero a 14-year old schoolgirl leading grown men and women up the garden path.The following month, he again dismissed climate warnings from activists like Thunberg, arguing that the main climate risk came from NATO and the military industrial complex. He said: We are facing climate catastrophe; not man made the likes of Greta Thunberg talks about, but through our own governments.Galloway has also called for more fossil fuel extraction. In an X post in March 2022, a month after Russias full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Galloway wrote: Britain needs to ice its [Net] Zero fantasy, step up its oil exploitation [and] invest in peaceful nuclear energy and seek to re-harvest the 1,000 years of coal under our feet employing clean-coal technology. Our Energy policy is hopelessly unbalanced.From 2008 to 2013, Galloway worked as a presenter for Press TV, the English-language channel run by the Iranian government. From 2013 to 2015 Galloway was paid 100,000 to present a show on RT (Russia Today), Russias equivalent. Both countries are major oil and gas producers. The channels have since had their broadcasting licences revoked by Ofcom for breaking its rules (Galloways broadcasts were not referenced in the ruling).According to a favourable profile in Rochdale Online, Ellison has been active in the local community protecting green spaces, and is credited with winning Rochdale recognition by the Royal Horticultural Society In Bloom awards.He doesnt appear to have commented publicly about Labours weakening of its own net zero plans. Earlier this month, the party dropped its pledge to invest 28 billion per year in green measures, cutting its spending plans by 75 percent to 23.7 billion in total. Labour says it will still keep to its target to decarbonise the UKs power grid by 2030.The party opposes new North Sea exploration, but supports unproven carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology on existing rigs. Earlier this month, Labour leader Keir Starmer said current pipelines would continue for decades.Lib Dem candidate Iain Donaldson has said he wants to hold the government to account on water companies polluting the rivers with filthy sewage, among other issues. In a 2017 tweet he criticised the then U.S. President Donald Trumps withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement.Donaldson was one of eleven of the partys 15 MPs who voted against the Offshore Petroleum Licensing Bill this week, while four abstained. The Liberal Democrats propose moving the net zero target forward five years to 2045 and support large investments in renewable energy.A Liberal Democrat spokesperson said Donaldson had opposed the oil and gas bill, which fails to take vital steps to grow the UK renewable energy sector and reduce energy bills, and fails to form a coherent path to net zero.Iain wants to see the de facto moratorium on onshore wind farms lifted, they added, and allow the expansion of the cheapest form of energy to drive down bills in this cost of living crisis, and reduce our emissions helping to slow climate change.
safe,Former prime minister Scott Morrison said he wants to be like Julia Gillard after politics, the SMH reports, because shes widely respected for her post-PM conduct. Erm, one might say shes widely respected for her leadership achievements  her iconic gender equality speech, Gonski, NDIS, the NBN, and the valiant attempt at a carbon price  as well as her more recent charitable achievements with Beyond Blue, the Wellcome Trust and the Global Partnership for Education, but whatever. Morrison will give his last speech at noon today before his political retirement (and there may be some dancing in the streets this afternoon), saying we should connect with Judeo-Christian values, The Australian ($) says. His parting thoughts: Peter Dutton is doing a fab job as Liberal leader (in December Dutton was voted the countrys least trusted politician) while former (and possibly next) US president Donald Trump poses no threat to our national interest.Meanwhile, Trump was in awe of Russian President Vladimir Putinexactly like a kid is in awe of the heroic football team captain, former PM Malcolm Turnbull recalled from his leadership days to ABCs Q+A. Its downright creepy, Turnbull continued, not to mention a threat to Australias security considering Trump and his Republican allies are sympathetic to Putin and dont care about democracy. The former PM continued Trump could force Ukraine to surrender or pull out of NATO (which he may well do, as CNN says) adding wed be dealing with three autocracies if he wins the November US election (plus China and Russia). Turnbull also described himself as a friend of Israel and said Hamas wanted Israel to kill Gazan civilians. But he posed two rhetorical questions: is the Palestinian death toll (now 29,606) so high that Israels claim to protect human life is bogus, and is Israel losing so much public support that theyre doing what Hamas wanted?Mardi Gras has asked NSW Police not to march in Saturdays parade, ABC reports, after a cop was charged with the alleged murders of a Sydney couple. The board said the community needs space to grieve the loss of the pair, who would have attended the festival. NSW Police said they were disappointed. NSW Premier Chris Minns pointed out that some in the force would have experienced discrimination themselves and that he hoped theyd be able to represent their community as well as NSW Police. It comes as deputy commissioner David Hudson said alleged murderer Beau Lamarre-Condon had been approved to keep his gun away from the police station, the SMH said, though wouldnt say whether it was kept at his home. The force has asked Victorias commissioner to review NSWs gun policies.To another battle for equality and a female miner makes $38,562 less than a male one, new Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA) data reveals. It looked at the pay gap in every company with more than 100 employees (there are 5,000 of them) and found 61.6% paid men more, 30.1% paid both genders almost the same (within 5% anyway) and 8.3% paid women more. So how is it calculated? It lines up mens and womens salaries at a company from lowest to highest and picks out the middle value  the median. So its not measuring men against women doing the same job  thats been the law for over 50 years. Airlines were particularly disparate  Alliance Airlines: 50.2%, Jetstar: 43.7%, Virgin Australia: 41.7%, Cathay Pacific: 39.5% and Qantas: 37%, as Guardian Australia lists. At brewer Lion, maker of XXXX, Tooheys and Four Pillars gin, the median base pay gender gap is just 1.4% the ABC adds.Private Media, parent company of Crikey, was not assessed.Former deputy PM and Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce has a sleeping disorder known as comorbid sleep apnoea and insomnia (COMISA), an expert will tell him on a new show called Australias Sleep Revolution with Dr Michael Mosley. And people with that combo die earlier, the expert will tell him per news.com.au. The result came after they measured his blood pressure both before and after 10 sitting days of Parliament (it goes from high to dangerously high) and monitored his sleep. The three other politicians involved in the program are Senator Jacqui Lambie and Labor MPs Mike Freelander and Josh Wilson. It comes after Joyce bowed to pressure and took leave from Parliament after being filmed having fallen off a plant box in Canberra and swearing into his phone.To a very different type of sickness now and Northern Territory Polices most elite unit had a c**n of the year award for members who exhibited the most c**n-like behaviour, former police officer Zachary Rolfe told the inquest into the death of Indigenous teenager Kumanjayi Walker, who he shot and killed while trying to arrest. Absolutely dismal. The Australian ($) reports the inquest is unearthing the seedy culture of the Top Ends police, including messages and radio transmissions between police officers that used deeply offensive slurs about Indigenous peoples. Rolfe said hed been racist too, but said it was accepted in the NT Police and had rubbed off on him. To something more positive now and women receiving support through an Indigenous-led maternity care model are three times less likely to have their newborns removed by child protection services, The National Indigenous Times reports. We can make great change through holistic services, one expert said.Nur Hidayah Mohamad was in her early twenties when she faced the last goodbye with her father. He had kidney disease and was nearly at the end when he dug into his old wallet and placed the equivalent of a $16 note into her shaky hands. Looking down at the note tearfully, she grabbed a nearby pen and scribbled last money from dad in Malaysian  the words duit last ayah bagi as ABC reports. She tucked the note into her own wallet intending to treasure the priceless memento forever. But some months later, Hidayah realised the note was all the money she had left. She said a silent little prayer that it would return to her one day as she spent the note.Four years later, a person named Azfarul Zainol withdrew some cash from an ATM when he spotted something odd in the wad. Reading the words, Zainol was touched and promptly tucked the note into his wallet in much the same way Hidayah had. It had to mean something to someone, he figured, so he posted a photo to his Facebook wondering about the original owner. Next minute the post had been shared some 12,000 times, and confusingly, he had four separate messages from people claiming to be the writer. One of them was Hidayah, and Zainol could feel the painful truth in her message (though he checked her social media posts to make sure her story checked out anyway). The pair met up soon after and he handed Hidayah the note, the token of her fathers last act of care safe in her hands again.I do know how to do projects. I do know the science. And I do know the economics. These misinformed, unscientific, uneconomic, plucked-out-of-thin-air bulldust of nuclear policies of politicians masquerading as leaders helps no-one.The Fortescue billionaire says only bad things can happen if we believe nuclear energy to be our fairy godmother in the climate change era as Opposition Leader Peter Dutton and Coalition figures spruik.But Keating was not then, and isnt now, an all-knowing oracle, as he is sometimes deified by the press gallery. His boundless confidence empowered him not only to overcome the forces of complacency on much-needed changes but also to blow past legitimate reservations on less noble quests, such as privatisation,enterprise bargainingandan inadequate recession response, which his Labor descendants have since begun undoing.Nines Peter Hartcher worries Keating is only now souring his legacy, but his record was in fact always mixed. This would be a matter for historians, if Keating did not bob up so frequently in public debate, and if his prescriptions had changed with the times. But they havent. He is still pushing the same barrows he was in the 1990s, for better and worse. He is not a prophet; he is a fossil.Only 21 federal politicians out of 277 have not declared any gifts from Qantas. A further two have declared interests in Qantas but no lounge membership. Liberal Senator David Fawcett  who is a lounge member but has chosen not to declare it  reported getting an upgrade from economy to premium economy on a flight from Perth to London last July.The other, Labor Senator Tony Sheldon  a prominent critic of the airline and its leadership under ex-CEO Alan Joyce  bought Qantas shares last September. That was the same month Joyce announced he wouldbring forward his retirement after being grilled in the Senate about Qantas record profits, customer dissatisfaction and alleged anti-competitive behaviour.There are a few reasons for Egypts opposition. The first is that Egypt does not want to be seen to be facilitatingethnic cleansing through the permanent resettlement of Palestinians outside of Gaza. In October,a leaked documentfrom Israels Intelligence Ministry included recommendations to forcibly transfer Gazas population of 2.2 million out of the territory and into tent cities in Egypts Sinai Desert.Government ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir have also both openly advocated the expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza to make way for their replacement by Israeli settlers. Further, in January,a conferencein Israel calling for this very plan wasattended by 11 members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus cabinet and 15 additional members of Parliament.A faultline has opened in Keir Starmers pragmatic politics  and this time none of the usual fixes will work  Nesrine Malik (The Guardian): Its ostensibly successful face-saving amendment to the SNPs ceasefire motion  and its apparent pressure on the speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, to upturn parliamentary convention  brought about a crisis in the Commons, and has done little to appease angry voters. The resulting waves of claim and toxic counterclaim are still building: Lee Andersons outburst of anti-Muslim rhetoric has led to him being stripped of the Tory whip. No matter how much analysis says otherwise, particularly the sort that treats Westminster as a self-contained theatre of political gamesmanship, Labours victory was a pyrrhic one. It was secured in the Commons but lost outside its walls, highlighting an inescapable limitation in the partys very coding.Whatever motion Labour ended up ramming through, it came too late. The partys first position on Gaza, refusing to condemn breaches of international law (or even call them that), and refusing to call for a ceasefire, has made too strong an impression for it to be erased by any new modifications. It was a position that fed into something bigger: into pre-existing reservations and dwindling faith in the party. For those the party was trying to bring round, the manner in which it prevailed will only act to reinforce its most suspect qualities  calculating, pedantic, authoritarian. Ready to drag Parliament into the mire so it could pursue its manic drive to keep control of a party narrative that now exists only in the leaderships heads.Families once fled my struggletown suburb. Then the gentrifiers arrived  Claire Heaney (The Age): Richmond feels like a big country town as you spot familiar faces at the bowlo, walking to the G to barrack for the Tiges or shopping at the Gleadell Street Market each Saturday. When there is a big game at the MCG, the suburb comes alive. Living in Richmond when the Tigers won the 2017 and 2019 premierships is up there in my all-time favourite moments. Two of my children went to schools beyond their home suburb and in the early years said they wished they lived out in the greener parts of Melbourne, where their friends had swimming pools and huge rumpus rooms to host sleepovers and parties  Theres no way I could afford to buy here now. Richmonds median house price is $1,377,500 and the unit price $590,000. I fear young families may be missing out on the experience of raising a family in Richmond.Its beginning to feel like there are more fur babies than the human variety. While people shift out once kids arrive or feel that they have outgrown the suburb, there can be huge benefits in staying. Kids can walk to school, to sport training or part-time jobs, encouraging their independence and helping us avoid many hours stuck in traffic. Richmond continues to evolve as we enter a new cycle where many of our older friends give up the inner-city lifestyle and move out. The thought of leaving has crossed my mind, but the convenience of being so close to the city, medical services, shopping, recreation, trams and trains and varied food offerings makes it as hard to give up, as are the friendships forged over decades.Emma Elsworthy is Climate Editor at Crikey, SmartCompany, and The Mandarin, and writes daily morning newsletter the Worm.

Our fourth quarter conference calls always provide a great opportunity to discuss the past year's developments in the uranium and nuclear fuel markets. It's also a good time to touch on a few annual highlights that demonstrate how well our strategy is performing and to provide some insights into our current expectations for the year ahead. So that's the outline I'll follow today. This past year, we've been consistently talking about the positive market momentum, so I think I can be fairly brief on that side of things. We spent a great deal of time on our calls, in our presentations, and on our webcasts talking about our optimism and positive view of the constructive market conditions we've seen throughout 2023. And we are absolutely maintaining that enthusiasm moving into 2024. Those listening today that tuned in for a few of our calls and presentations prior to 2020, would be very familiar with the phrase positive long-term fundamentals. I say somewhat tongue-in-cheek that we use that message more than just a few times to reinforce our optimism through the lowest points of the market cycle. Back when we initially made that statement, we certainly couldn't forecast the timing of a market transition. But we remained convinced that once the excess uncommitted primary supply and mobile inventories cleared the market, and as demand continued to grow, our industry would recover and our company, would be stronger than ever. So now, as we watch the uranium contracting cycle shift closer to a replacement rate level, I can say with confidence that we have entered the early part of that long-term window, we'd been talking about. And those fundamentals we were referring to, they are even more positive than we had anticipated. On the demand side, we used the term durable at every opportunity as we believe it accurately describes and effectively differentiates today's fundamental demand picture from previous cycles. The previous peaks in our market have typically lasted for weeks, while the valleys have lasted for years. That was the case when the excitement about uranium and nuclear was driven by one or two discrete events. A mine shaft failure, the end of the megatons to megawatts program, a flooded mine in development, Chinese contracting that absorbed significant supply. Those types of events all added speculative, shorter-term, momentary pressure to supply and demand. However, in today's environment, the uranium market is certainly having more than just a moment. Instead, we're seeing full-cycle growth in the near, mid, and long-term with broad interest in nuclear energy like never before. And it's being driven by global scale factors that are widely expected to persist for years to come. Geopolitical tension is prompting governments all over the world, to reevaluate energy security and enact policies to reduce risk and eliminate reliance on unstable jurisdictions. And as they do so, climate change and electron accountability remain top of mind, which truly puts nuclear in the spotlight. There's a growing consensus that there is, no net zero without nuclear, and 28 countries have now signed on to an international declaration that calls for a tripling of nuclear energy capacity by 2050. The EU, U.S., U.K., Canada, France, and Japan, are just some of the jurisdictions, where bipartisan support is translating to political action, with a few already introducing financial incentives to back nuclear development. As a result of this support, we are seeing life extensions, reactor refurbishments, and a call for new builds to provide secure, reliable, and clean base load power. And we have a technological evolution on the horizon as well, with SMRs and advanced reactors extending the use case for nuclear, beyond just electricity, further strengthening the outlook for growing demand. So demand is durable, and growing with more support than ever. So how does that stack up, against the supply side fundamentals? Well, that's where significant uncertainty remains. The geopolitical tensions that are pushing the reevaluation of energy security are also adding negative pressure to supply, resulting impact on mining activity, fuel cycle services, supply chains, and global transportation continues to create significant challenges. Last week we saw a tangible impact on supply, resulting from those challenges when our Kazakh 2.16 partner, Kazatomprom (LON:KAPq), revised their expected 2024 production volumes down in response to limited access to acid and development delays. We're now working with Kazatomprom to determine the impact on our share of 2024 production from JV Inkai. Supply chain challenges combined with ongoing mine depletion, declining and finite secondary supplies, and a decade of underinvestment in exploration and mine capacity amid low market prices has led to what is a very tight market today, something that is expected to persist into the next decade. So considering both demand and supply, I think we can safely reiterate that strong long-term fundamentals is still a message that continues to resonate, creating the full cycle growth, we've been talking about. Looking back at the very difficult supply discipline decisions, we had to make and the strategy we put in place in the context of that persistent, positive long-term view. I can now say it was all to prepare us for today's market, and for the second half of this decade and beyond. We at Cameco have maintained a disciplined approach to managing the financial, contracting and operational facets of our strategy during those tough times. We did what we said we're going to do, which positioned us well to capture full cycle demand with a supply pipeline that was only going to respond to real end-user demand as it evolved. And considering customer fuel requirements into the future, we knew that the focus had to return to the long-term market, because as always, the total volume of requirements, is far greater than what is available in the near-term spot market. It evolved quickly just as we predicted it would, and our patients and our experience are paying off with positive results. We saw a significant improvement in our financial performance metrics in 2023, thanks to higher sales volumes and higher realized prices in our uranium and fuel services segments. This drove improved net earnings, adjusted net earnings and cash from operations, which all more than doubled in 2023, compared to the year before, and with a significant increase in adjusted EBITDA. And our continued discipline and our tried and tested long-term contracting strategy, helped to mitigate risks related to our capital decisions and mining plans. Our strategy is designed to allow us to align production decisions, with our customer needs and the commitments in our contract portfolio and ensures we don't add excess supply and capacity when there's no demand in the market. We understand that to generate full cycle value, we can't be mining on spec. We must build a home for our pounds years ahead of time before we pull them out of the ground in order to avoid having to sell material into a thinly traded and discretionary spot market. That means in today's contracting cycle, we can link the pounds that we previously left in the ground to the long-term contractual commitments that are being negotiated today. And those contracts are being executed in the context of a significantly improved market environment, generating value for Cameco as we deliver into them now and in the years to come. We ended 2023 with a healthy contract book and total long-term commitments of 205 million pounds of uranium with 37 customers worldwide. That total commitment level of over 200 million pounds only represents about 20% of our current reserve, and resource base, providing us with plenty of exposure, to improving demand from our customers, as they look to secure their long-term needs. To deliver on those commitments, we must continue to plan for the sourcing of the uranium we need well ahead of time. In the near and mid-term, we always start with our expected production from MacArthur River, Key Lake, Cigar Lake, and Inkai. We can then draw material from our inventory and with the licensed storage facilities that we operate, we have secured the ability to borrow product under the terms of some of our storage agreements. Additionally, we have the ability to pull forward long-term purchase arrangements that, we put in place in a much lower price environment. Our marketing team can also source material, from market purchases. While those purchases would be more expensive than, our production and other available supply, our strategy and long-term portfolio positions us to benefit when there is increased near-term demand, for scarce nuclear fuel supplies and services. However, when it comes to sourcing for the longer term, based on our existing contract portfolio and the contracting momentum that is building in the market, we do expect to need more than our current annual production volumes. That includes the more than 130 million Tier 1 pounds that we've left in the ground, when we shifted into supply discipline from 2016 to 2022. As a major producer, we don't often discuss our pipeline of reserves and resources. But when we consider that pipeline in the context of the more than 200 million pounds we've committed under long-term contracts that, include escalated prices and escalated floors and ceilings, we have an exposure rate of about 80%. That means we have about 800 million pounds of current in-ground inventory that is not contracted or priced, representing future potential value. That's part of a very deliberate strategy. As a proven and diversified producer, Cameco is well positioned to add long-term value. And, since we are always adding to a contract portfolio that provides upside participation and downside protection, we expect development of future production from that in-ground inventory will be funded by the cash flow from product sales, not from dilutive equity raises, or significant debt leverage. Thanks to our discipline and our improving financial performance, we consider the next steps in our strategy and start to invest in our Tier 1 capacity. We now have an updated Cigar Lake technical report that we expect to release sometime in March, which includes the conversion of over 40 million pounds of our share of indicated resources to probable reserves, extending mine life at Cigar to 2036. And, we're undertaking a study to evaluate the work, timelines and investment required to expand the MacArthur River mine and the Key Lake Mill from 18 million pounds of annual production today, up to the licensed capacity of 25 million pounds, our share being 70%. If we took advantage of all Tier 1 growth opportunities, our annual share of Tier 1 uranium supply, could be about 32 million pounds. But, beyond our Tier 1 assets, we also continue to assess the future need and economic potential of our fully licensed and permitted Tier 2 assets. Those assets remain on care and maintenance today, but they provide another layer of optionality when it comes to sourcing material for long-term commitments. And remember that unlike a declared or untested asset owned by a developer making promises, our Tier 2 assets are demonstrated assets with an operational history and known costs, and they're in the hands of a proven producer, putting them in a much lower risk category. As one of the world's largest producers, we don't realize any benefit from the voluntary public disclosure of our advanced project work at Millennium, [Yaleri] and Kintyre or from our ongoing exploration successes. But there too, we continue to make progress and evaluate future prospects that align with market demand and our long-term contract sourcing requirements. We've provided a bit more background on our exploration framework in our MD&A this year, because it's not widely known that we have discovered numerous Greenfield prospects and deposits over the years. And those discoveries are underlying the very attractive land position on the most prospective trends, all right in our backyard of Northern Saskatchewan, where we have well-established industrial and mine support infrastructure, and where our exploration activities continue. Beyond uranium mining, our contracting success and financial strength is also allowing us to grow and enhance the value of our fuel cycle assets and other investments. Similar to our mining assets, we won't increase fuel services production or capacity until we see customer commitments. Thanks to that disciplined approach, we have the capacity to grow at a time when customers are avoiding Russian supplies and services, and the market has identified a significant need in the conversion and enrichment stages of the fuel cycle. To meet those growing commitments in our Fuel Services segment, we are increasing our 2024 UF6 production at Port Hope to 12,000 tonnes, which would represent a record production level for the facility, exceeding the record production levels we set in both 2022 and again in 2023. We've now contracted 75,000 tonnes of UF6 conversion with 33 customers worldwide, which we expect to underpin the operation of our Port Hope conversion facility for years to come. We also have a 49% interest in global laser enrichment, which holds the exclusive license to deploy a third-generation uranium enrichment technology. Subject to its continued progress towards commercialization, if successful, GLE could have the ability to help meet the evolving enrichment needs of the industry, from re-enriching depleted uranium tails to producing commercial low-enriched uranium, for the global reactor fleet in operation today. To delivery of high-assay, low-enriched uranium for the SMRs and advanced reactors of tomorrow, GLE represents a significant opportunity for Cameco, to participate in every stage of the fuel cycle. We're also excited to have added a 49% share of Westinghouse to our portfolio of investments in 2023. Westinghouse is a well-established and critical business to the nuclear power industry, which gives us more exposure to the light water side of the nuclear fuel cycle, while adding potential growth opportunities related, to their conventional and advanced reactor sales. We expect our share of adjusted EBITDA from Westinghouse in 2024, to be between $445 million and $510 million. And we believe the business is well-positioned for long-term growth, driven by the expected increase in global demand for nuclear power. Over the next five years, we expect Westinghouse's adjusted EBITDA, to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 6% to 10%. But even with the significant acquisition in Westinghouse, we have maintained the capacity for further investments, should value-adding opportunities emerge. Our balance sheet remains strong, with $567 million in cash, approximately $1.8 billion in total debt, and a $1 billion undrawn credit facility. In our Uranium segment, we expect this past year's strong financial performance to continue in 2024. We will continue to transition to our Tier 1 cost structure, and deploy the capital and other expenditures we believe are necessary, to meet our commitments and position the company for continued, sustainable growth. Growth that will be pursued in the same manner that, we approach all aspects of our business - strategic, deliberate, disciplined, and with a focus on generating full-cycle value. And with a continued focus on the environmental, social, and governance side of our business as well, where we are very proud of our track record. We integrate ESG principles and practices into every aspect of our business, from our corporate objectives and our approach to compensation to our overall corporate strategy, risk management, and day-to-day operations. As part of our low-carbon transition plan, we created tailored decarbonization pathways in 2023, for each site we operate to support the achievement of our 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. We also completed an analysis of climate change scenarios at our Northern Saskatchewan and Ontario operations, to better understand how changing climate conditions could impact our employees and our assets in the long-term. I encourage you to read through our annual MD&A where we go beyond just performance highlights. In it, you will see a much more detailed picture of our strategy, how we operate, and importantly, insight into the uranium and nuclear fuel market, a market that is unlike any other. So thank you for your interest today and we would be happy to take any questions.Ralph Profiti: Good morning, Cameco team. Thanks for taking my questions. Tim, in the evaluation of MacArthur River up to 25 million pounds, when will this work be completed? Assuming things being taken into consideration include issues from September 2023, including your supply chains, skilled labor, as well as some of the special technical considerations. Do you see a potential scenario where Tier 2, whether it be U.S. ISR or Rabbit Lake, may be more desirable than MacArthur River production? Because those production centers may not be as constrained.Tim Gitzel: Yes, morning Ralph. Thanks. Nice to hear from you. We are just starting the MacArthur Key evaluation work now. We are seeing a market that we think might need those pounds going forward. Those are probably the best pounds on the planet that are not in production yet. So, we are starting our work on what we need to do to de-bottleneck at the Key Lake Mill. The mine is running well today and we know it can produce at that level. So, we are starting the work. Obviously, we are not going to produce on spec. Grant has said that a 100 times. We produce in the contracts that we have. So, we will get that work going and like I say, we are going after that before we go after any Tier 2, I think, project that we still have in care and maintenance. But don't rule those out either, Ralph, because those are on our batting lineup further down the list. But first, as we said in our quarter here, we are going to look at de-bottlenecking MacArthur and Key. So, we can get those to '25 and then that extension, don't underweight that extension of Cigar Lake to 2036. That is a huge move and it really sets us up well for the future.Ralph Profiti: Okay. Understood. Yes, thanks for that color. I also noticed in the uranium sensitivity table that the leverage to 5% change in uranium to revenue is quite low this year. I am just wondering what is going on with the contract book versus the realized price guidance and why we are seeing that sort of diminished leverage versus previous years. And it seems like this is a function of the contract books, maybe perhaps hitting more of those ceilings, or perhaps even up flexing on the part of customer discretion?Grant Isaac: Yes, I think - it is a great question, Ralph. And let us be really clear that we set a strategy that supports short-term price discovery in order to create long-term value. And what I mean by that, is it is categorically the wrong way to think about a uranium producer, as saving production for the spot market in order, to maximize near-term leverage, to the spot market. And the reason for that, we said over and over again, and people really need to understand this, the spot market is small, it is discretionary, it is non-fundamental, and it is low-quality demand. If Cameco produced and showed up and tried, to sell pounds into the spot market, it would not be discovering higher prices. The opposite would happen. The market would realize that we would be showing up with uncommitted primary production and the market would back up. And do not take my word for it. Look at what happened in the days when Paladin, for example, was a spot market seller or Kazatomprom was a spot market seller. That strategy has been proven to be a colossal failure over and over again. So what matters is the non-discretionary, fundamental, high-quality demand of the term market. But make no mistake, Ralph, we do not miss these market moves. We just capture them and build them into the forward contract book. You have heard me say over and over again, we prefer market-related contracts right now. A move like this in the spot market, which we do not sell into, because we do not want to undermine that move in the spot market, allows us to then price market-related contracts forward on a much more attractive basis than we did before the spot market move. And I will just give you an example. When Uranium pushed over $100 per pound, Cameco does not immediately go, how do we sell into the spot market? We go, how do we translate that kind of spot market quick move into forward value? So a market-related contract that we would write today and give to a utility probably has a floor tucked right up at today's long-term price, escalated, and probably has a ceiling in the 120s, escalated. That is how we capture the value of a spot market move. Those who want to play the spot market show up with uncommitted primary production. They put pressure on it, in a thinly traded market it goes down, and they ride it back down. What we do is, we take those moves we build it into the contract portfolio going forward. It's a strategy that sustains near-term price discovery and helps bring that long-term price back up to a sustainable production economic level. So with all that context, no surprise, contracts that we entered into a number of years ago, where if they were at a $70 ceiling a few years ago, would have been a really attractive ceiling. We might be hitting those ceilings in a market-related today. For example, or if there was some base escalated portion. It is good news that this is occurring. It means the market is going into a security of supply contracting cycle. It means our supply discipline strategy is working. It means the forward value capture is growing. And then, of course, I want to reference the comment Tim made, which, folks, 20% of our portfolio of reserves and resources is contracted. 80% is not. That's 800 million pounds of uranium to be priced in a much better environment now. So, we never miss these moves. We build these moves into long-term contracts, long-term cash flow and earnings. That's what's happening.Andrew Wong: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you just talk about your confidence level on production returning to nameplate in 2024 and just some of the longer-term projects for Cigar and MacArthur? I think previously the messaging was that, those projects may not be looked at until the volumes start getting contracted and the demand was there. So now that work is starting on those projects, does that mean that those volumes are starting to get some contracting activity?Tim Gitzel: Thanks, Andrew, for the question. Yes, so just how confident are we on production for this year? We put out 18 million pound forecast for each of those sites, and we're very confident that we'll make that. We have got some more operating experience at MacArthur and Key every month that goes by. It gives us another view on how it's going, and I'd say the last two months have been very good. I'm looking at Brian Reilly, our production has been very good, very steady. We're working out some of the bottlenecks or kinks that you have with a restart. So, we're really happy with the way things are going there. Same at Cigar. You know, well-established mine. We've been operating there for years. We moved into that new war zone. We're getting that under control. The mill had some hiccups, and they've got that under control. So yes, we're very confident in our forecast for 2024. And going forward, yes, as I said earlier, we won't produce on spec, but we will get those assets ready to go at MacArthur Key, and once Grant and his team have contracts in front of us that call for that production, we will move those forward. We'll move the production up at MacArthur Key. And so, there's a timing thing and things don't just happen overnight. We want to be ready when that happens, and the contracts we sign, those long-term contracts that Grant was referencing earlier, they don't start deliveries for a number of years. So we've got time to get things ready. We've got dry powder, and when the time comes, we'll be ready to go. So, we really like our positioning.Andrew Wong: Okay. Great. And maybe for Grant, the contracting strategy makes a lot of sense. Could you maybe just talk about how the contract book and price sensitivity table would look like, beyond the years that are in that table, maybe into like the late 2020s and early 2030s, where you might get more of that leverage, to the rising price environment that we're seeing today?Tim Gitzel: Yes, absolutely designed for leverage to that rising price environment. I mean, really important to emphasize, we are still in supply discipline. We are not calling the top of the market. This is not peak demand going on in uranium yet. We're in the early stages of this contracting cycle, early stages that suggests it's the right strategy, to be very disciplined with our supply. We're thinking about moving the Tier 1 to full capacity like Tim talked about, but we haven't made that decision yet with respect to MacArthur Key, and we haven't even started talking about the Tier 2s. And if we put that altogether and said, what would our annual capability be, that's about 38 million pounds of annual production. And you see in our guidance table, 22.4. So Cameco is not calling peak demand here, or peak price discovery in the uranium business. We're still in supply discipline. We're still in supply discipline, because we think when we look at the uncovered requirements wedge, a lot of demand, non-discretionary fundamental demand needs to come to the market. We want to be exposed to that. So it isn't about selling out the volumes. It's about placing volumes under terms and conditions that make sense to us today. So that is that market related exposure that I talked about. That is really dramatically improving floors and ceilings that are both escalated by the way. And of course, a long-term price that's now $72 U.S. per pound. And that itself is base escalated if you agree to any of those contracts. So as you see going forward, we would look to move beyond that contract table, which only accounts for about 20% of our volume. In fact, that committed sales table is less than that. It's only about 13% of our volumes, because it's just the next five years. So we have 80% of those volumes that aren't yet sold yet. It's a good thing. Prices are going up. We want that exposure to future prices. And when you think about our reserves and resources that aren't yet priced, that have that pure exposure to the uranium price, those are reserves and resources that are in the hands of a proven producer. And many of those reserves and resources are adjacent to existing infrastructure, and you can take advantage of all those incumbencies. So this is exactly where a responsible uranium producer wants to be. Should be in a market that is entering a security of supply contracting cycle. So absolutely, we love our position. We love that exposure going forward. It would be foolish to say, well, we should just be trying to jam all of our material through $103 spot market, because the spot market wouldn't be $103 if we tried to do that. That would be a really silly strategy. So that exposure going forward, nobody has a better position than we do.Orest Wowkodaw: Hi, good morning. A couple of questions on my end, if I could. First of all, can you give us an idea of what kind of capital was required to bring MacArthur up to $25 and to extend Cigar?Brian Reilly: Yes, sure. Great question. Certainly Cigar Lake extension. We are well advanced. We completed a pre-feasibility study that verified the economic feasibility of the extension. We've converted resources to reserve, so we're well down the track there. We'll produce a technical report next month, as Tim mentioned, with all the details. But what we have now in terms of our share for capital at Cigar Lake extension, somewhere in the $250 million, $300 million range, to extend it up to 2036. So Cigar Lake extension is in good shape, and we'll produce a technical report with all the details. MacArthur Key Expansion, early days, very early days. As Tim mentioned, we've just commenced the assessment in terms of what's required at the mine and an end-to-end study at the mill. So, I would suggest just hang in there. We'll be better positioned later in the year, but still early days for MacArthur Key Expansion.Orest Wowkodaw: Perfect. And then a quick question for Grant, if I could. Just on the committed purchases, I guess you've got 4.7 million pounds committed to acquire this year. Can you give us any kind of idea of how the pricing mechanism works on those contracts? Like does it move with market pricing? Is it fixed? How should we think about that?Grant Isaac: Yes, thanks, Orest. So on Page 51 of the MD&A for folks that are looking, we do have a bit of new disclosure actually on our purchase commitments. In previous markets where the spot was oversupplied and we were in extreme supply discipline. And wanted to be heavily over-contracted. We would put a big purchase number out there, because we wanted the market to know that demand was coming and start cleaning up the front end of the market and discovering better prices. But as we're at this phase of our transition, restoring our Tier 1 cost, bringing production back, we wanted to bring a bit more granularity, between what purchases are we already committed to make, and which ones might we go into the market to buy. And what you see when we cut it that way, is very small exposure to the market. We said up to two million pounds that we might buy in the market, but we might. We don't have to. We have other options in order to source our committed sales. Some of those other options include purchases that we make under a long-term purchase commitment. And I think that's what you're referring to. Generally what happens in those long-term purchase commitments is we'll see a market where we might think the uranium price is low. And when we do, we might find a seller who's willing to fix a price for us, subject to a carry trade for delivery out into the future. But for many of those contracts, we have the ability to take delivery when it makes sense for us. So, we fix the price in a lower pricing environment. We take the delivery when it makes sense to meet our committed sales volumes. It's the best trading margin in the business. So many of those long-term contracting, long-term purchase commitments were made in that $30 uranium market. They've escalated a bit, some of them in more recent years, but well, well short of today's market prices. So this is just part of how we think about sourcing material over the long run. So very small market exposure to be deployed if we want to. And then subject to the purchases that come in from Inkai, the purchases that come in from the long-term purchase program. The final thing on Inkai is always remember, we're never afraid of rising uranium prices. And Inkai is a perfect example. Yes, we'll buy the material from Inkai at a discount to the spot price. Those will be very expensive. But if those are expensive, then the dividend that comes back from Inkai is even bigger. So the economic value of those Tier 1 assets is always ours. And we don't fear when prices go up. We don't miss these markets. We capture that value on the long-term. So very attractive source of supply that really reduces our need to go into the market to purchase. But if we see the opportunity to purchase, we'll stick our nose in there. So if somebody decides they want to try to sell material to the spot market, we might be a buyer.Tim Gitzel: Yes, that's right. We saw that some folks were completely misreading our outlook table in the past. They were taking the overall purchases and they were assuming every one of those was going to be made in the spot market and trying to drive an incorrect narrative about financial distress. And of course, we've never run the company that way. If that were the case, the outlook table would be very different. So, we wanted to put some granularity out there, to lots of sophisticated folks understand what we do, but some don't. And so, we just wanted to make sure we had that granularity and remind folks that actually it's up to two million pounds. We could source it directly in the spot market for immediate delivery. We could draw down our inventory. We could access loans. We could access more of the long term purchases if that made sense for us. We could be engaged in a conversation with a customer to move deliveries around in a year for when production comes in. Ultimately, this is what a responsible uranium producer does.Greg Barnes: Yes. Thank you. Just a couple of questions for me and returning back to Cigar Lake extension. Would that be at the 18 million pound per year range or would it decline into 2036? And is there an extension beyond 2036?Tim Gitzel: Greg, thanks for the question. Our plan would be to remain at 18 million pounds per year to 2036. Is there an extension? We're just working on this one right now. So once we get under there, and you know, we're moving to the west on that. And so as we get out there, who knows? We'll be poking holes and holes all over down there. So, we're hopeful, but we don't have anything to report yet, Greg.Greg Barnes: Okay. Just on the Westinghouse guidance for CAGR of 6% to 10% a year. Does that only include in terms of the AP1000 sales, the ones that have been under contract or under contract currently? Or do you make a forecast of potential AP1000 sales that build into that number as well?Tim Gitzel: Yes, Greg, here's the good news. It's just the ones that you know about, the ones that Westinghouse has announced. So more upside to come as they, we believe, might have a huge opportunity in other markets that, are evaluating that stable, proven AP1000 technology. But this is just capturing, the beginnings of the contracts required, to advance AP1000s in the markets that have already announced it.Grant Isaac: Well, lots of interest remains in the conversion plant at Springfields for the natural conversion line. But Springfields is also a critical infrastructure, for a lot of other ambitions as well. We're continuing to work through that process. Obviously, very attractive conversion prices right now in the market that, put some wind in the sails for a restart. But it's got to be done responsibly. It's no different than the uranium market. You don't start a conversion plant, and then start knocking on people's doors and asking if they want to buy a conversion service, because you're just going to push the conversion price down. You have to do this responsibly and in a disciplined way. And we're just working through that process now.Lawson Winder: Thank you very much, operator. And good morning, Cameco team. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about Westinghouse. And it's fantastic to have the detailed disclosure in the notes. The G&A effectively, the marketing administration and general expense is a little bit of a larger number than I thought. Would you be able to provide any detail on what goes into that, or what are some of the large numbers maybe in that or how that breaks down? And then any guidance for that going forward as well? Thank you.Grant Isaac: Yes. There are elements of the Westinghouse business that are pretty high touch. When we think about the core of the business, which we define as nuclear fuel and operating plant systems, as well as the new build, there are a lot of offices, a lot of engagement and a pretty high touch that goes on advancing those kind of contracts. And so, right now when they're at the stage of developing new markets like they are for VVER fuel or developing new markets like expanding into BWR fuel or examining LEU+ fuel. And even the question that Greg asked earlier about Springfields, you know, this is all captured in increased activity running through that line. And of course, the support required to advance new builds, whether that's AP1000s, AP300s or eVinci. So, a bit of a higher touch business than what Cameco is accustomed to, but totally appropriate given the position that Westinghouse is in and their ability to capture the tailwinds in the nuclear industry as well.Heidi Shockey: Yes, it's Heidi here. I would say that they're a pretty stable business. And maybe I would just add to what Grant said in terms of the other pieces that that's really recognizing the fixed costs. Like that is all the costs that, aren't directly related to operations. So, it's maybe broader than just kind of G&A.Lawson Winder: Thank you very much. Now for my follow-up question, I had actually wanted to ask about the conversion market as well. And Grant, you had expressed some review in the investor call in December during the Investor Day that perhaps prices were sort of getting near a top. But I mean, prices have continued to rise since then. I mean, have you changed your view at all? Do you think prices can continue to rise higher, or are in fact we getting to a level where prices are sort of as high as they might go?Grant Isaac: Yes, well, my comment earlier, Lawson, about Cameco's not calling peak demand, or peak pricing, I was referring to uranium, but perhaps in conversion as well. I mean, this market has not really reckoned yet with a couple of big risks. And one of them is obviously the risk that not only does the legislative efforts to restrict Russian supplies in Western markets, become codified into law, but the risk that there's a Russian retaliation. That would be a very constructive environment for conversion, because remember that Russian enrichment service shows up attached to something. It shows up in a cylinder that already has the uranium, already has the conversion. So that will continue to add pressure, to the conversion side of the business. And then, of course, this market, I don't think really appreciates at how difficult restarting production can be, whether it's a uranium asset, whether it's a conversion asset. I think a lot of folks are just assuming these things are easy and they build in a perfection scenario. So between those two really big risks that, there's a ban on Russian material that the Russians actually react to by saying, okay, well, you can't have it today, as well as the reality that's going to set in, that all these big promises about new supply, whether it's on the uranium side or the conversion side, are just going to take longer. That's further price formation in the industry that needs to come. It's why we don't want to call a top. It's why we don't want to rush and secure all the contracts for conversion that would sell out Port Hope or encourage Westinghouse to do that for Springfield. There's more to come to this market. We've seen this story before. Now's the time to remain patient and let that price discovery unfold.Alexander Pearce: Great. Thank you. Good morning all. So I just wondered if you could build on some of the market commentary you've made and in particular just the changes that you've seen so far this year and particularly what's changed in terms of your discussions with utilities since you updated them because that's been from last week.Grant Isaac: Yes, we've seen a market that has behaved exactly like we told you it was going to, Alex. When the market begins to enter a security of supply cycle, actually the importance of the spot market goes down and the importance of the term market goes up. And look at the data. The spot market was smaller in 2023 than it was in 2022. So utilities focus less on the spot market. They focus more on the term market. Goes back to my earlier point about why we don't try to sell stuff into the spot market. It's thinly traded. It's non-fundamental discretionary demand. So as utilities are shifting over, we're seeing a market that hit about 160 million pounds of term contracting. It might be easy to conclude we're at replacement rate, Alex, but I would just say we're not quite there yet because there were two very, very big contracts that went through the market. One that Cameco had with Ukraine and one that Kazatomprom had with the Chinese. If you back those out and ask on a distributed basis across all markets, are we at replacement rate? The answer is no. And so the good news is we're in the early innings of a security of supply contracting cycle. We haven't yet hit a distributed replacement rate and we've never been at this stage of the cycle at these prices before, which is why we want to continue to have that exposure going forward. But some of the common characteristics, tenors continue to go up. Utilities coming to the market for security of supply are looking for requirements covered on a longer term basis. Tenors are going out. Volumes are going up, not just because more years are being added, but because utilities are taking a bigger bite out of each of their requirements contracts. And then, of course, time frames are going out. There are utilities who, Alex, are really well covered for the rest of this decade. They're now worried about the next decade and they're starting to look to contract into that window as well. So all of that very constructive for a view that the long term demand is building, not peaking, but building. And that what we want to remain is very disciplined to capture as much of that price discovery as we can.Alexander Pearce: Great. Thanks, Grant. And then, Tim, you mentioned in your comments the ability to bring forward some of those purchase agreements if required. Are you able to quantify if indeed that did happen for this year for guidance and how much you've brought forward from future years into this year in these purchases?Grant Isaac: It's Grant again. Our plan in the outlook table was the plan all along on that 4.7 million. So we have that as an option to exercise more of those long term purchase requirements if we want. It's why the disclosure on market purchase is up to 2 million pounds. That would be one of the levers why it's not a hard 2 million pounds because we may not buy it in the spot market. We don't have to, but if it makes sense for us, we will.Brian MacArthur: Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. It goes back to the last question. So in this table, and I appreciate now you've given the breakout, two things. Do you assume that you get your Inkai purchases every year? Because again, you also stated right now we're not sure what we're going to get. Again, those are, as you said, profitable pounds once you do the equity component. If not, how do you balance for that? Because again, the question is you could be getting 4 to 5 million profitable pounds from Inkai. And my third question on that is I can't remember, are you getting 50% or 40% of the joint venture now under that agreement? Thanks.Grant Isaac: Brian, let's just start with yes, the table assumes that the volumes expected from Inkai in 2024 arrive. But of course, as we saw in 2023, there can be sometimes timing differences. We got about two-thirds of Inkai's 2023 volumes in 2023, the remainder early 2024. This is something we can deal with as Cameco because we have other sources of supply. We have other mines. We have our inventory. We have all of the levers we've already been talking about. This is actually a much, much bigger problem for the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle because it's close to 50% of the global production of uranium that isn't arriving when it needs to arrive at Western markets. So for Cameco, it's something we can plan for, something we can deal with. We eventually get those pounds and we can deal with the time issue associated with them. The overarching assumption is yes, we're going to receive them. If we don't, we'll manage.Tim Gitzel: Grant, I'd just add to that that the sharing is 60-40 once you reach the nameplate capacity of 4,000 tonnes per year, which is just over 10 million pounds. We've never hit that peak yet. Over the last number of years, we've basically received as a share of production what we would get at 40% of 10 million, so around 3.2 million pound.Brian MacArthur: Great. Thanks. Just so I can be really clear, you also, as you mentioned, got last year's shipments from Inkai. You presumably have those pounds in inventory and the other ones in the Canadian port. So would you not feel pretty comfortable that you're going to have a lot of Inkai pounds to sell this year because they've already arrived and that's embedded in those numbers?Grant Isaac: Yes. Sorry. I hope my comments weren't viewed as being unconfident. We're very confident that that supply is going to show up. And if there are timing challenges, we deal with it within our inventory, within our other sources of supply. So extreme confidence.Brian MacArthur: Okay. Thank you very much. And one quick last question. CRA, I don't want to go back to this at all because I sort of figured it's hopefully dealt with, but I do see you have to put some more money aside again. So we've done 2017. Does that mean they can do '18 and '19? You might have to put money aside this year? Or a letter of credit aside?Sean Quinn: Sure. We did have the reassessments in 2017 and we put I think $70 million aside, which we expect we'll have to post in the form of a letter of credit. The problem does diminish. The problem with the CRA continues, but the size of the problem diminishes over 2018, 2019, 2020 as the pounds that were sold through our offshore trading structure diminished. So I don't have the exact size of the diminishment in front of me, but it does get smaller as we look forward.Tim Gitzel: Well, thank you, operator, and thank you to everyone who joined today. As Rachelle noted, if you have detailed follow-up questions related to the 2023 results or any questions that we didn't get to today, please send those in to us and we're happy to address them directly. We continue to believe that Cameco remains the best way to invest in the recovery of the nuclear fuel cycle and positive momentum behind nuclear energy. With 35 years of experience in this market, we've built a strong reputation as a proven and reliable supplier with a diversified production portfolio, a portfolio that provides us with the flexibility to work with our customers to ensure they maintain access to our reliable supplies to satisfy their ongoing fuel requirements. The world has put a priority on achieving net zero carbon emissions in the decades to come, and it's become clear that there's no net zero without nuclear. And I would go a step further and say, in fact, there's no nuclear without Cameco and Westinghouse. So it's also becoming clear that there's no net zero without Cameco. We believe we have the right strategy to achieve our vision of energizing the clean air world and we'll do so in a manner that reflects our values. So thanks, everyone, again, for joining us today.

safe,PALM BEACH, Fla., Feb.  21, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FN Media Group News Commentary - According to a report from a RationalStat industry report, the Global Uranium Mining Marketvalue was estimated atUS$ 8,086.6 million in 2023and is expected to rise at a strongCAGR of over 5.0%over the forecast period of 2023-2030. About 66% of the global production of uranium from mines is from Kazakhstan, Canada, and Australia. It also said that the global uranium mining market is expected to reach US$ 11,388.3 million by 2030, with an annual growth rate of more than 5.0%. The uranium mining market is estimated to be 53.0 thousand tons (kt) in 2023. The report added: Uranium mining is the extraction of uranium ore from the ground for use in nuclear power plants and the development of nuclear weapons. Uranium is a radioactive element that occurs naturally in trace amounts in soil, rock, and water. Uranium is primarily used as a fuel in nuclear reactors, where it undergoes nuclear fission to produce energy in the form of heat. Based on the mining method, the open-pit mining segment is the most common method of uranium mining, accounting for over 90% of global uranium production in 2022. Open-pit mining is a relatively simple and inexpensive method of mining, and it is suitable for deposits that are close to the surface. Active mining companies in the markets this week include Stallion Uranium Corp. (TSX-V: STUD) (OTCQB: STLNF), FISSION URANIUM CORP. (OTCQX: FCUUF) (TSX: FCU), Denison Mines Corp (NYSE American: DNN) (TSX: DML), Uranium Energy Corp (NYSE American: UEC), BHP Group Limited (NYSE: BHP).RationalStat continued: Some leading players adopt various strategies in order to reinforce their market share and gain a competitive edge over other competitors in the market. Mergers & acquisitions, partnerships and collaborations, and product launches are some of the strategies followed by industry players. Based on region, the Asia Pacific region is predicted to be the fastest-growing uranium mining market in the next years, owing to the region's increased nuclear power generation. Nuclear power is regarded as a clean energy source because it produces no greenhouse gases when in operation. Countries investing in nuclear energy to cut carbon emissions and battle climate change are boosting the uranium market.Stallion Uranium Corp. (TSX-V: STUD) (OTCQB: STLNF) Completes Largest Airborne Geophysical Survey in Southwestern Athabasca Basin - Survey Area Covered Over 2,200km2, Preliminary Results Reveal Over 560 km of New Conductive Trends - Stallion Uranium Corp. (FSE: HM40) is pleased to announce the preliminary results from the completion of the MobileMTTM airborne geophysical survey (the Survey). The Survey covered the entire 2,200 sq/km of the Atha Energy (CSE: SASK) JV Uranium Project (the Project), a new frontier of exploration in the prolific southwestern Athabasca Basin and part of the largest exploration land package held by Stallion.Stallions strategy to build out the largest exploration land package, taking on a new frontier of exploration in the southwestern Athabasca Basin, has been rewarded with the results of this regional survey, stated Drew Zimmerman, CEO. Utilizing the latest survey technology we have transformed an underexplored land package, uncovering hundreds of kilometers of conductive trends that are highly prospective target areas for uranium mineralization. Not only have we extended known prolific conductive corridors, but we have also been able to uncover completely new zones. We believe the process of identifying, prioritizing, and advancing the best targets from over 2,200sq/km gives our team the potential and probability of finding the next significant uranium discovery.Preliminary Results - The preliminary interpretation of the survey data has changed the landscape in a meaningful way, successfully identifying over 560 km of new conductive trends across the Atha Energy JV Project. This opens a new frontier of exploration in the southwestern Athabasca Basin, as the project area has never had effective exploration. With the completion of the survey, the company has been able to identify and extend new conductive corridors that were previously unknown. These new conductive corridors will be the cornerstone that the next phase of exploration is built on. The survey was able to identify structural complexities, including bends and splays, in the basement geology which suggest favorable conditions for uranium mineralization. These results, along with the advanced 2-D and 3-D inversion modeling, will be used to prioritize the newly identified conductor corridors for the next stages of exploration.Darren Slugoski, VP of Exploration commented, We are incredibly excited to see the quality and number of targets that were identified by the completion of the regional MobileMT survey. The 560 km of conductive corridors identified greatly exceeded our expectations. This survey provides Stallion with a significant number of high priority target areas the company can prioritize and advance towards the drilling.

(TSX: DML) (NYSE American: DNN), as joint-venture partners in the McClean Lake Joint Venture (MLJV), recently announced that the MLJV has approved a restart of uranium mining operations using the joint ventures patented Surface Access Borehole Resource Extraction (SABRE) mining method. Orano Canada owns a 77.5% interest and is the operator of the MLJV and Denison owns a 22.5% interest.Mining is planned to commence at the McClean North deposit in 2025, with 2024 activities expected to focus on preparations necessary to ready the existing SABRE mining site and equipment for continuous commercial operations, as well as the installation of eight pilot holes for the first mining cavities planned for excavation. The approved budget for this work in 2024 is $7 million (100% basis).Approximately 800,000 lbs U3O8 (100% basis) are targeted for production from McClean North in 2025, with approximately 3,000,000 lbs U3O8 (100% basis) identified for potential additional production from a combination of the McClean North and Caribou deposits during the years 2026 to 2030.Uranium Energy Corp (NYSE American: UEC) recently announced that the Company's Board of Directors has approved restarting uranium production at its fully permitted, and past producing, Christensen Ranch In-Situ Recovery ("ISR") operations in Wyoming. The recovered uranium will be processed at the fully operational Irigaray Central Processing Plant ("CPP") with a current licensed capacity of 2.5 million pounds U3O8 per year. The Irigaray CPP is the hub central to four fully permitted ISR projects in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming, including Christensen Ranch.The first production is expected during August of this year and will be funded with existing cash on the Company's balance sheet. As UEC's strategy has been to remain 100% unhedged, produced uranium will be sold at prevailing spot market prices which was $106 per pound U3O8 as of January 15, 2024 as reported by UxC.In the coming months, the Company will provide additional information on the expected volumes for the first year of production. The key focus in the final pre-production phase before the August restart is hiring and training of additional operations personnel to augment UEC's experienced operations team to ensure a successful ramp-up of uranium production. New personnel are anticipated to be hired from local communities such as Buffalo, Gillette, Casper, Kaycee and Wright.BHP Group Limited (NYSE: BHP) has recently announced its second cohort of six companies, chosen from a pool of over 500 applicants, to join the BHP Xplor accelerator program. The accelerator program is designed to support early-stage mineral exploration companies in finding the critical resources needed to support the energy transition.Each company will receive a grant of up to US$500,000 together with access to a network of internal and external industry experts to accelerate its growth and further build out its exploration concepts. The program aims to support development across technical, business and operational facets of the participating companies.BHP Xplor pushes the boundaries of what has conventionally been achievable in the exploration field. Over the span of the six-month program, the six companies will work collaboratively with BHP Xplor to expedite the maturation of their geological concepts to position the projects for commercialisation or partnership.FISSION URANIUM CORP.

safe,The battery will not catch fire or explode in response to punctures or even gunshots, unlike some current batteries that can be unsafe if damaged or exposed to high temperatures, says Chinese startup Betavolt ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Chinese company Betavolt claims to have developed a battery that could power mobile phones that never need to be charged and drones that can fly forever. Photo: Betavolt.tech ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A Chinese startup claims to have developed a new battery that could power smartphones for 50 years without the need for charging. Beijing-based Betavolt said its nuclear battery is the first in the world to realise the miniaturisation of atomic energy, placing 63 nuclear isotopes into a module smaller than a coin, reads an Independent article. The battery works by converting the energy released by decaying isotopes into electricity through a process that was first explored in the 20th century. Terming it as the next-generation battery, the company has said the project already entered the pilot testing stage and will eventually be mass-produced for commercial applications like phones and drones. "Betavolt atomic energy batteries can meet the needs of long-lasting power supply in multiple scenarios, such as aerospace, AI equipment, medical equipment, microprocessors, advanced sensors, small drones and micro-robots," the startup said in a press release. "This new energy innovation will help China gain a leading edge in the new round of the AI technological revolution." Betavolt said its first nuclear battery could deliver 100 microwatts of power and a voltage of 3V while measuring 15x15x5 cubic millimetres. It plans to produce a battery with 1 watt of power by 2025. Their small size means they could be used in series to produce more power, with the company imagining mobile phones that never need to be charged and drones that can fly forever. Its layered design also means it will not catch fire or explode in response to a sudden force, Betavolt claims, while also being capable of working in temperatures ranging from -60 degrees Celsius to 120 degrees Celsius. How it works To create the radioactive battery, Betavolt's scientists used nickel-63, which is a radioactive element, as the energy source and then diamond semiconductors as energy converters. The team developed a single-crystal diamond semiconductor that is just 10 microns thick and then placed a 2-micron-thick nickel-63 sheet between two diamond semiconductor converters. The decay energy of the radioactive source is then converted into an electrical current. Betavolt claims the advantages of its atomic energy batteries are their lightweight, long service life, and high energy density, and they can normally work under extreme temperatures from -60 to 120 degrees Celcius. Due to the modular design, multiple atomic batteries could be connected to provide a higher energy output that could power automotive technology and AI systems, just to name a few. Radiation concerns Nuclear energy, however, also comes with concerns regarding radiation. However, Betavolt addressed this concern, stating the battery is safe as it has no external radiation and is suitable for use in medical devices inside the human body, like pacemakers and cochlea implants. "Atomic energy batteries are environmentally friendly. After the decay period, the 63 isotopes turn into a stable isotope of copper, which is non-radioactive and does not pose any environmental threat or pollution," the company said. It could even be safer, too, as Betavolt states that the BV100 will not catch fire or explode in response to punctures or even gunshots, unlike some current batteries that can be unsafe if damaged or exposed to high temperatures. What tiny-sized nuclear batteries mean Scientists in the Soviet Union and the United States were able to develop the technology for use in spacecraft, underwater systems and remote scientific stations. However, the thermonuclear batteries were both costly and bulky. The quest to miniaturise and commercialise nuclear batteries was taken up under China's 14th Five-Year Plan, designed to strengthen the country's economy between 2021 and 2025, while research institutions in the US and Europe are also working on their development, reads the Independent article. This technology could revolutionise electronics by removing the need for chargers or portable power banks altogether, creating devices that run continuously and whose batteries do not degrade in terms of capacity and lifespan over charging cycles as Li-ion batteries do. Such unlimited power could provide drones that fly continuously, phones that run constantly, and electric cars that don't require recharging.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Chinese company Betavolt claims to have developed a battery that could power mobile phones that never need to be charged and drones that can fly forever.

Beijing-based Betavolt said its nuclear battery is the first in the world to realise the miniaturisation of atomic energy, placing 63 nuclear isotopes into a module smaller than a coin, reads an Independent article. The battery works by converting the energy released by decaying isotopes into electricity through a process that was first explored in the 20th century. Terming it as the next-generation battery, the company has said the project already entered the pilot testing stage and will eventually be mass-produced for commercial applications like phones and drones.

After the decay period, the 63 isotopes turn into a stable isotope of copper, which is non-radioactive and does not pose any environmental threat or pollution," the company said. It could even be safer, too, as Betavolt states that the BV100 will not catch fire or explode in response to punctures or even gunshots, unlike some current batteries that can be unsafe if damaged or exposed to high temperatures. What tiny-sized nuclear batteries mean Scientists in the Soviet Union and the United States were able to develop the technology for use in spacecraft, underwater systems and remote scientific stations. However, the thermonuclear batteries were both costly and bulky. The quest to miniaturise and commercialise nuclear batteries was taken up under China's 14th Five-Year Plan, designed to strengthen the country's economy between 2021 and 2025, while research institutions in the US and Europe are also working on their development, reads the Independent article. This technology could revolutionise electronics by removing the need for chargers or portable power banks altogether, creating devices that run continuously and whose batteries do not degrade in terms of capacity and lifespan over charging cycles as Li-ion batteries do. Such unlimited power could provide drones that fly continuously, phones that run constantly, and electric cars that don't require recharging."This new energy innovation will help China gain a leading edge in the new round of the AI technological revolution." Betavolt said its first nuclear battery could deliver 100 microwatts of power and a voltage of 3V while measuring 15x15x5 cubic millimetres. It plans to produce a battery with 1 watt of power by 2025. Their small size means they could be used in series to produce more power, with the company imagining mobile phones that never need to be charged and drones that can fly forever. Its layered design also means it will not catch fire or explode in response to a sudden force, Betavolt claims, while also being capable of working in temperatures ranging from -60 degrees Celsius to 120 degrees Celsius. How it works To create the radioactive battery, Betavolt's scientists used nickel-63, which is a radioactive element, as the energy source and then diamond semiconductors as energy converters. The team developed a single-crystal diamond semiconductor that is just 10 microns thick and then placed a 2-micron-thick nickel-63 sheet between two diamond semiconductor converters. The decay energy of the radioactive source is then converted into an electrical current. Betavolt claims the advantages of its atomic energy batteries are their lightweight, long service life, and high energy density, and they can normally work under extreme temperatures from -60 to 120 degrees Celcius. Due to the modular design, multiple atomic batteries could be connected to provide a higher energy output that could power automotive technology and AI systems, just to name a few.

safe,The latest details of the proposed Cuffs Run hydroelectric plant can be seen on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission website at elibrary.ferc.gov. Click on Docket Search and enter P-15332 in the Enter Docket Number box to view the preliminary permit application and submitted public comments.The public has through March 31 to comment on York Energy Storage LLCs plan to construct a 1.8-mile-long dam and flood 580 acres in Chanceford Township, York County, to create a hydroelectric facility designed to feed power into the regional grid.The Cuffs Run pumped storage project, named for a Susquehanna River tributary that would become part of the flooded zone, would create a kind of battery. Water pumped uphill from Lake Clarke, the stretch of flat water created by the nearby Safe Harbor Dam, would be held in the newly formed reservoir and then run downhill through turbines to create electricity.Environmental groups see the project as destructive to an as-yet-undisturbed stretch of a river already crowded with hydroelectric plants. The projects developers view the proposed power plant as a key part of the regions transition to renewable energy.Preliminary assessments estimate the projects 1,000-acre total footprint would affect 50 properties, three preserved farms, 2 miles of the Mason-Dixon trail in York County, and hundreds of acres of forest.We feel this is a multicounty issue as to whether we are a community that wants to give up this forest and farmland or fight for it, Lancaster Conservancy CEO Fritz Schroeder said, and we believe it is definitely worth the fight.After public comment closes on April 1, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will review York Energy Storages application and decide whether to grant a preliminary permit. If regulators approve that permit, it will trigger a four-year process of ecological and economic impact studies.The permit application lists more than 20 proposed impact studies, ranging from land surveys to vegetation and wildlife assessments to tax and employment projections, at a total estimated cost of nearly $11 million.Bill McMahon, who runs York Energy Storage with his partner Jan Sockel, has been working on a version of the project since its original proposal in the 1990s. Another attempt stalled in 2011. McMahons current desired timeline would bring the plant online in 2033.The permit application lists an inflation estimate of 3% and a total cost estimate of $2.3 billion, but McMahon said he has since revised the inflation estimate to 4% and raised the total estimated cost to $2.5 billion.If the growth in renewable technology continues to accelerate, solar and wind sources could generate more than the grid can absorb, and that excess energy could be used to pump water at the Cuffs Run plant, McMahon said.In that case, running the water back downhill through the turbines would release energy first generated from solar and wind. That process would be taking advantage of energy that would otherwise be wasted, and that energy could supply the grid at times when solar and wind are not producing, McMahon said.Schroeder said the destruction of carbon-storing, biodiverse forest should also be factored into the projects cost and cited studies that show the organic matter trapped in dam reservoirs generates a significant amount of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. More on the Conservancys objections can be viewed at lancasterconservancy.org/protect-cuffs-run.Federal regulators rejected the permit application, originally submitted in February 2023, multiple times, asking for additional information, particularly about the potential impact on the hydroelectric plant Brookfield Renewable U.S. operates at the Safe Harbor dam.McMahon said he provided Brookfield with a study showing that operating Cuffs Run and Safe Harbor plants at the same time would stabilize water levels in Lake Clarke and make operations more efficient. He added that the study is 30 years old and would be redone if the Cuffs Run project progresses.Brookfield emailed this statement: York Energy Storage has not provided Safe Harbor Water Power Corporation with the information necessary to adequately assess their claims concerning the impacts of the YES Project on our Safe Harbor Project.Republican state Sen. Kristin Phillips-Hill of York joined 17 nonprofit and local government groups in signing a July 2023 letter urging federal regulators to reject York Energy Storages application for a preliminary permit.This project does nothing but ravage pristine and preserved farmland in York County, as well as put historic and popular tourist destinations along the Susquehanna River underwater. This proposal is yet another attempt by out-of-town developers to destroy lives and livelihoods for the benefit of Maryland, which will not generate or stabilize their own power, Phillips-Hill said in an emailed statement on Tuesday.The full list of signers on the July letter includes the Cuffs Run Alliance, Farm & Natural Lands Trust of York County, Lancaster Conservancy, Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association, Susquehanna National Heritage Area, Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Chesapeake Conservancy, Chesapeake Legal Alliance, City of Lancaster, Keystone Trails Association, Lancaster Farmland Trust, Mason-Dixon Trail System, PennFuture, Penns Valley Conservation Association, Waterkeepers Chesapeake, Watershed Alliance of York and WeConservePA.Evgeniadis said community engagement efforts have included reaching out to the Office of Public Participation at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to discuss hosting a public forum in Chanceford Township.
safe,Scope: Using graphs, Roy Spencer demonstrates that his graphic techniques of presenting datasets reveal differences in data rather than hiding them. In another post, Spencer explores why different time periods fit different models better than other time periods. As discussed in two reports, the high cost of wind and solar power has become evident in Europe. Mann v. Steyn is discussed including the view of climatologist Judith Curry.Hide or Reveal? Richard Feynman set a high goal for scientific research when he wrote: The first principle is that you must not fool yourself  and you are the easiest person to fool. Many of those who are motivated by a passionate interest in a topic easily fool themselves by ignoring data that questions their desired result or adjusting the data to give their views the most favorable impact. The graphs presented by Al Gore in the movie The inconvenient truth are an example. He shows graphs indicating that temperatures and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations move together based on Antarctic ice cores. He claims this proves that changes in carbon dioxide concentrations cause temperature changes.Actually, it does not. The graphs just show that there may be a correlation. Certainly, based on experiments, carbon dioxide is absorbed more readily in cold water than warm water, and as water warms CO2 is released. This can be seen in ocean upwelling, which are rich primary producers of aquatic sea life. They bring to the surface cold water that is rich in carbon dioxide, nitrogen and phosphorus promoting phytoplankton which begins the energy base for a complex food chain including providing food for fish, marine mammals, seabirds, and other creatures.Numerous studies have pointed out that Mr. Gore had the timelines wrong to claim causation. In general, temperature changes occurred before CO2 changes, by an average of about 800 years. Al Gore has no explanation for the actual timeline which he hid, probably unintentionally. Al Gore fooled himself on the timeline, thus the causation claim.Since the blogosphere continues to amplify Gavin Schmidts claim that the way John Christy and I plot temperature time series data is some form of trickery, I have come up with a way to demonstrate its superiority. Following a suggestion by Heritage Foundation chief statistician Kevin Dayaratna, I will do this using only climate model data, and not comparing the models to observations. That way, no one can claim I am displaying the data in such a way to make the models look bad.The goal here is to plot multiple temperature time series on a single graph in such a way their different rates of long-term warming (usually measured by linear warming trends) are best reflected by their placement on the graph, without hiding those differences.Lets start with 32 CMIP6 climate model projections of global annual average surface air temperature for the period 1979 through 2100 (Plot A) and for which we have equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) estimates (Ive omitted 2 of the 3 Canadian model simulations, which produce the most warming and are virtually the same).Here, I am using the raw temperatures out of the models (not anomalies). As can be seen in Plot A, there are rather large biases between models which tend to obscure which models warm the most and which warm the least. [graph not shown here]Next, if we plot the departures of each models temperature from the full-period (1979-2100) average, we see in Plot B that the discrepancies between models warming rates are divided between the first and second half of the record, with the warmest models by 2100 having the coolest temperature anomalies in 1979, and the coolest models in 2100 having the warmest temperatures in 1979. Clearly, this isnt much of an improvement, especially if one wants to compare the models early in the record right? [graph no shown here]Finally, I show the method John Christy and I have been using for quite a few years now, which is to align the time series such that their linear trends all intersect in the first year, here 1979 (Plot E). Ive previously discussed why this seems the most logical method, but clearly not everyone is convinced.What we want is a method of graphing where the model differences in long-term warming rates show up as early as possible in the record. For example, imagine you are looking at a specific year, say 1990 we want a way to display the model temperature differences in that year that have some relationship to the models long-term rates of warming.Of course, each model already has a metric of how much warming it produces, through their diagnosed equilibrium (or effective) climate sensitivities, ECS. So, all we have to do is, in each separate year, correlate the model temperature metrics in Plots A, B, C, D, and E with the models ECS values (see plot, below).I hope this is sufficient evidence of the superiority of our way of plotting different time series when the intent is to reveal differences in long-term trends, rather than hide those differences. [Boldface was italics in original]As TWTW has frequently stated, the climate model data is near surface-air data. There are no standards regarding where the temperatures are taken, time of day, instrumentation, or frequency. Even in the US which once was the gold standard, as Anthony Watts and his team have shown, the standards for the US are overwhelmingly ignored. Further, as Tony Heller has shown, the data have been so heavily manipulated by politicized government agencies that the original data has been lost. There is no question that there is a greenhouse effect which keeps the land masses on earth warm enough to support complex life and carbon dioxide (a gas critical for green life which creates food for all complex life) is a secondary greenhouse gas, after water vapor (another gas critical for life on Earth). See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy and Measurement Issues  Surface & Lowering Standards for some of Hellers recent work.When computing temperature trends in the context of global warming we must choose a region (U.S.? global? etc.) and a time period (the last 10 years? 50 years? 100 years?) and a season (summer? winter? annual?). Obviously, we will obtain different temperature trends depending upon our choices. But what significance do these choices have in the context of global warming?Obviously, if we pick the most recent 10 years, such a short period can have a trend heavily influenced by an El Nino at the beginning and a La Nina at the end (thus depressing the trend)  or vice versa.Alternatively, if we go too far back in time (say, before the mid-20th Century), increasing CO2 in the atmosphere cannot have much of an impact on the temperatures before that time. Inclusion of data too far back will just mute the signal we are looking for.One way to investigate this problem is to look at climate model output across many models to see how their warming trends compare to those models diagnosed equilibrium climate sensitivities (ECS). I realize climate models have their own problems, but at least they generate internal variability somewhat like the real world, for instance with El Ninos and La Ninas scattered throughout their time simulations.Ive investigated this for 34 CMIP6 models having data available at the KNMI Climate Explorer website which also has published ECS values. The following plot shows the correlation between the 34 models ECS and their temperature trends through 2023, but with different starting years.The peak correlation occurs around 1945, which is when CO2 emissions began to increase substantially, after World War II. But there is a reason why the correlations start to fall off after that date. [Boldface added]If those models had not differed so much in their aerosol forcing, one could presumable have picked a later starting date than 1945 for meaningful temperature trend computation. Note the differences remain large even by 2015, which is reaching the point of not being useful anyway for trend computations through 2023.The entire exercise demonstrates the absurdity of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its followers to seek an equilibrium climate. As Richard Lindzen has shown, Earth has dozens of climates that are constantly changing that cannot be measured by temperature. In addition, we did not have good measurements of ocean temperatures until the Argo float program which began in 1999.Energy Transition: Western governments are trying to force an energy transition onto their populations that the people clearly do not want for a number of reasons primarily because alternatives to traditional electrical generation do not provide affordable, reliable electricity. In short, politicians trying to enforce such measures are incredibly naive (foolish).Last week, TWTW discussed the views of noted security specialist, Professor emeritus Gwythian Prins of the London School of Economics (and Political Science) on the Net Zero plan of replacing coal, oil, and natural gas with wind and solar creating a national security problem for the UK. His report, Archimedes Fulcrum was published by Net Zero Watch.This week, Net Zero Watch published Retreat from Net Zero is under way by Ross Clark, a lead writer and columnist at the Spectator as well as a frequent contributor to several national newspapers including the Daily Telegraph, Daily Mail and the Express. His concepts are easy to understand, and he addresses many of the failures of new energy. His views may be too optimistic, for the beast may be difficult to kill.Paul Homewood directed us to The Struggle to Achieve Net Zero Emissions  While Balancing Security, Affordability and Sustainability by Morten Springborg of C WorldWide Asset Management, a fund manager based in Copenhagen and registered in the US and UK. It was formerly known as Carnegie Asset Management. The report starts with a quote from a dramatically successful woman from a poor white family in Appalachia (US) which sums the problems of energy transition:Despite rapidly rising investments, the decarbonization of our energy systems continues to progress too slowly. The transition is failing because the chosen strategy is not aligned with the Energy Trilemma constraints of security, affordability, and sustainability. Focusing solely on solar and wind will not get us to the net zero target. Measured in primary energy terms, renewables have very low power density, and therefore, solar and wind should only be used for direct electrification where the energy losses are lowest.In this paper, we will begin describing our predicament today, and in a follow-up paper, we will focus on the solutions: Diversified energy systems, technology, and improved energy efficiency. Advanced nuclear fission, and fusion from the 2030s, as well as nature-based carbon sinks, natural gas, and energy efficiency as described in our White Paper from 2021. We should not blindly pursue short-term CO2 reduction targets, which can only be met at excessively high costs to our societies; the price is long-term decarbonization, and there will be a hockey stick development when the right technologies are available.From Main Street media to academia and Wall Street brokerage research, an unrelenting chant has been heard for years: wind and solar are the cheapest forms of electricity. In more technical terms, solar and wind are claimed to have the lowest levelized cost of energy (LCOE), and therefore transitioning to a renewable-based energy system is not only good for the environment but also good for the economy as it lowers the cost of energy. Politicians, NGOs, and, importantly, more and more dominant green companies have been claiming this so loudly that arguing the opposite has become highly controversial. Canceled off-shore wind auctions, declining share prices of renewable energy companies, and the extremely volatile  and over time  higher electricity prices and degraded grid reliability almost everywhere where wind and solar have achieved meaningful market penetration have gone almost unnoticed by this green agenda.Very simply, as long as alternative sources remain unreliable and expensive, civilization will need traditional sources such as nuclear, hydroelectric, and fossil fuels, which the greens irrationally oppose and invent arguments against.The UN meetings on climate change have become renowned for their platitudes, with national leaders falling over each other to say what disparate straits the world is in, how we must decarbonize ever faster  before returning to their home countries and putting economic development well ahead of their promises to cut emissions. But the president of COP28 in Dubai in December 2023, Sultan Al Jaber, was unusually frank. Al Jaber, who also serves as the chair of Abu Dhabi state oil corporation, ADNOC, which recently announced a $150 billion investment to increase oil production by nearly 50 percent to 5 million barrels a day by 2027, appealed to former Irish President Mary Robinson: show me a road map for the phase out of fossil fuel that allows for social, sustainable developmentunless you want to take the world back into caves.Al Jaber was eviscerated for his comments, yet they were in tune with a silent majority. An analysis by the website Zero Tracker reveals that even countries with net zero targets are heavily resisting pressure to phase out exploration for and development of fossil fuel resources. There are 93 oil-producing countries that have net zero targets, but only six of them have plans to phase out oil. Only five out of 94 gas-producing countries with a net zero target have plans to phase out gas. As for coal-producing countries, only 65 of those with net zero targets have plans to stop production.As always with COP meetings, the event ended with a communiqu promising that the world would try to transition away from fossil fuels  which is a long way from agreeing to phase them out by a certain date, as many activists demanded. After two weeks and several hundred thousands of tonnes [metric tons] of carbon dioxide spewed out by private jets and the like, the 98,000 delegates who had signed up for COP28 had come up with nothing more than an empty promise.In fact, the list of countries with plans to phase out fossil fuels is showing few signs of growing. The new government in New Zealand has just reneged on the previous administrations pledge to do so. In Germany, Federal Economics Minister Robert Habeck recently announced that he may delay the countrys planned phase-out of coal by 2030 because of the energy crisis provoked by the invasion of Ukraine.Clark then goes into details such as fossil fuel use has never been greater, the costs on wind and solar are far greater than promoted, hydrogen power is losing its puff, small nuclear reactors are not appearing as expected, and EVs are running out of juice. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy and Questioning European Green.Mann v. Steyn: The jury trial in a Washington DC court is over, and the jury found in favor of Mr. Mann. A number of commentators have expressed their views. TWTW finds the entire show akin to the Scopes Monkey Trial in 1925 which was claimed by the winning side to prove that human evolution was a false concept. It did not.As with the Scopes trial, in Mann v. Stein physical evidence was never presented. The only expert testimony allowed was by Professor of Statistics and Data Science Abraham Wyner of Warton, University of Pennsylvania. No doubt he is an accomplished statistician, but does he understand the physical evidence required and the quality of that evidence?The expert testimony prepared by climatologist Judith Curry and statistician Stephen McKitrick, both of whom understand the physical evidence required for understanding the problem was not admitted. As with the Scopes Trial, the clear loser in the trial was the scientific method and scientific integrity. The victor was institutionalized science, which may or may not contradict nature, the ultimate judge in natural sciences.I submit this report under D.C. Superior Court Civil Rule 26(a)(2)(B) & (C) as both fact and expert witness to address the subject matter on which I expect to present evidence and to summarize the facts and opinions on which I expect to testify. This report includes my observations and opinions as a lay and expert witness concerning three principal topics: (I) the nature of the scientific and public controversy concerning the Hockey Stick graph; (II) whether the Hockey Stick graph can be regarded as fraudulent; and (III) Michael Manns role in the downward spiral of climate science discourse. I present sections (I) and (III) mostly in my capacity as a fact/lay opinion witness and section (II) in my capacity as an expert witness.Michael Mann claims to be the victim of a Serengeti strategy by political opponents of climate change policies. Mann has arguably been singled out for attacks because he has violated the norms of science: (a) withheld data from scientists who are critical of his work; (b) stifled criticism of his work within the IPCC and by distorting the peer review process; and (c) employed what he calls the Serengeti strategy to attack scientists who disagree with him.Of specific relevance to this lawsuit, Mann has been instrumental in the downward spiral of discourse surrounding climate change, the very thing that he decries in this lawsuit. His loose use of the word fraudulent with regards to research that is critical of his own plus characterizing people that he disagrees with as professional liar for hire, denier, anti-science, among other things, contributes to an anything goes environment for discourse surrounding this controversial and contentious topic.Number of the Week: $4 Trillion. In his report The Struggle to Achieve Net Zero Emissions  While Balancing Security, Affordability and Sustainability Morten Springborg references Statista that over the past 20 years new investment in renewable energy worldwide has been over $4 Trillion. Yet, no one has a demonstration project showing how much it would cost to make renewable energy reliable. As Dolly Parton reportedly said:To get some sense of powerful political agenda influences on global climate and environmental policies, its instructive to revisit the acid rain hysteria of the late 1960s which led quite directly to demonization of carbon dioxide (CO2) as a climate pollutant. Sadly, I admit that I have personal responsibility for initiating that transition of the acid rain hysteria into becoming the more serious global warming scare.Scientists with the European Union on Thursday announced their finding that temperatures over the past 12 months were 1.52 degrees Celsius (2.74 degrees Fahrenheit) higher than the average preindustrial temperatures between the years 1850 and 1900.The material reviewed so far in this paper confirms that there are a large number of factors that affect the earths climate. Many of these are poorly understood by man, and there are some factors that probably havent even been discovered yet.Chinas attitude to coal has been hard to swallow for Europe and other transition advocates but Beijing has made a point of explaining that on its list of priorities, energy security comes before energy transition.From article: It can happen almost anywhere but should be unlikely in Alberta  an emergency alert asking residents to reduce electricity usage to avert rolling blackouts. After all, Alberta has the worlds fourth-largest proven oil reserves and enough proven natural gas to meet Canadas domestic needs for hundreds of years. So, the crisis was self-inflicted, a result of excessive reliance on intermittent renewable energy. Its a wake-up call for Alberta but it should be for the rest of Canada, too.From the abstract: Here, for the first time, physics-based hydrodynamic flood models driven by rainfall and storm surge simultaneously are used to estimate the magnitude and frequency of compound flooding events. We apply this to the particular case of New York City. We find that sea level rise (SLR) alone will increase the TC and ETC compound flooding hazard more significantly than changes in storm climatology as the climate warms. We also project that the return period of destructive Sandy-like compound flooding will increase by up to five times by the end of the century. Our results have strong implications for climate change adaptation in coastal communities.By comparing minimum and maximum proxy temperatures over the Little Ice Age (~1300 to ~1850) and comparing them to minimum and maximum modern daily instrumental measurements since 1900, Neukom, et al. would have us believe that the modern warm period is unique. We have thousands of weather stations, ocean buoys, and ARGO floats around the world today. It is well known that daily temperature extremes often exceed 30C, which is more than 70 times the differences being estimated by Neukom, et al. as shown in figure 5, which is from their paper. These daily extremes are captured in instrumental data, but only seen occasionally, by pure chance, inaccurately, and in a very naturally smoothed way in the proxies. The proxies under sample both the high and low temperatures. Further, accuracy decreases backward in time.[SEPP Comment: The Argo float program began in 1999 and the data for calculation of atmospheric temperature trends started in 1979. Without establishing control periods or calibration periods, we have no basis for comparing current temperature trends with historic temperature trends from various proxies.][SEPP Comment: By the 1970s it was clear for those who studied the participation history of the area that the 1922 Colorado River Compact, dividing up the water between the upper basin and the lower basin (totaling seven states), was based on an unusually wet period.]Back then [before Cyrus McCormick invented the mechanical reaper], farmings efficiency hadnt changed much since the time of the pyramids. A man, using a scythe, could harvest approximately one acre of grain a day. [and approximately 80% of American population was involved in agriculture]. With todays machines, a farmer can harvest up to 100 acres in a day. Small wonder that only 3% of the US population today farms.The U.S. National Science Foundation is investing in new technologies that address the complex challenges in tackling food and nutrition insecurity from population growth, rising diet-related diseases and disparities and climate resilience.Did you know that in the 17thC glaciers relentlessly pushed downslope ruining thousands of acres of farmland and leaving many villages uninhabitable such as La Bois where a government official noted where there are still six houses. all uninhabited save two, in which live some wretched women and childrenAbove and adjoining the village there is a great and horrible glacier of great and incalculable volume which can promise nothing but the destruction of the houses and lands which still remain?With deaths from natural disasters and famine declining, and because fewer people die in warmer temperatures, the case for counting deaths from global warming is poor at best. But dont underestimate the ability of climate alarmists to create fear by exaggerating the data.[SEPP Comment: Will the deaths associated with global warming for a species that evolved in tropical Africa exceed the imaginary deaths from PM 2.5? Will we have more human deaths associated with these causes than humans?]Dezeen moans that Our biggest climate challenge is no longer denial, but despair. And a piece in Nature Mental Health (yes, there really is such a publication) says The mental health effects of weather-related disasters are well characterized, yet less is known about the effect of chronic, slow-onset climate change. Untrue.Empier Wind 2s canceled contract sent shocks further down the supply chain. The day after Equinox and BP announced the cancellation, Sangapore-based Seatrium said its $250 million deal to build a substation for Empire Wind 2 was dead. So too was a contract with Dutch manufacturer Sir for turbine foundations. A contract for rock installation, which stabilizes the sea-floor around marine structures, with Texas-based Great Lakes Dredge & Dock corporation was also terminated. . ..Most of these are jobs that have traditionally existed, such as waste collection, forestry management, water and wider environmental activities. There are also 53500 non-jobs such as consultancy, charities and management.Homewood: For starters, Amazon wont be running their operation on wind power, and consequently wont be drawing renewable resources away from homes and businesses. If they really wanted to go green, they would cut themselves off from the grid, and obtain their electricity direct from wind and solar farms.There are different variations of this technology, but in general, cold water is pumped down the well and circulated back to the surface hundreds of degrees hotter. With the help of a heat exchanger, the hot water is used to drive a turbine that generates electricity without any emissions.[SEPP Comment: Fords official parts catalog for the F-150 Lightning shows that the standard range battery costs $28,556 while the extended pack will set you back $35,960. This excludes any labor costs. According to the post, labor costs will more than double the battery cost.] Billions of taxpayers money will have been wasted. We should draw the lesson from that, as bitter as it might prove. The Government never knows what the industries of the future will be  and should leave it to entrepreneurs and customers to work that out.It probably wont come as any great surprise to learn the Baroness Parminter has zero experience in transport, industrial or economic matters. The Deputy Leader of the Liberal Democrats in the Lords has spent most of her useful life campaigning for animal rights and conservation charities.From the abstract: Not only does this risk locking us into a high overshoot above 1.5C (3), but it will also increase biodiversity loss, imperiling the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (KMGBF) goals.This is not to say California doesnt need to think hard about how it uses water. Roughly a billion gallons of water each day is slurped from the Colorado River to feed the thirst of San Diego and Los Angeles. If the population of California is roughly 40 million, that means each person guzzles 25 gallons each day. Something to think about. How much goes to stupid lawns which people never even use? How much goes to growing food that feeds 49 other states?On the other hand, Manns lawyer seemed to think that his best proof of actual malice lay in the NSF report finding no research misconduct by Mann. Making actual malice provable this way essentially means that members of the public are required to accept an official government party line to avoid exposing themselves to ruinous defamation suits. Maybe, just maybe, that argument could draw interest from the Supreme Court.In a small note of optimism, I suspect that Steyn can get help if he wants it from pro bono lawyers to proceed with appeals. Alternatively, he may decide that his best approach is to leave the United States and not pay the judgment. That is the approach that Mann has taken with the judgment issued against him in Canada for his failed defamation suit against Tim Ball.As the climate continues to change, millions of poor people face increasing challenges in terms of extreme events, health effects, food, water, and livelihood security, migration and forced displacement, loss of cultural identity, and other related risks.Speaking of the dreaded carbon footprint of farming, no sooner are we told to plant micro-gardens to calm our climate anxiety than a story blares Carbon footprint of homegrown food five times greater than those grown conventionally. Yaaaaaah!Congress this week will hold hearings on the permit freeze for new liquefied natural gas (LNG) export projects that President Biden announced two weeks ago. The closer one looks, the more harm this raw political payoff to the climate left will do to U.S. national security and economic interests.The White House has been whispering to its European allies not to worry about its moratoriums impact on LNG supply even as it crows to the climate lobby. Progressives are celebrating because they know the putative pause will shrink investment in LNG. Merely read the plaudits from climate potentates on the White House website.The Biden administration is listening to the calls to break Americas reliance on dirty fossil fuels, Sierra Club executive director Ben Jealous proclaimed. Its undeniable that LNG export projects are simply not in the public interest and we are confident that if this review is done right, that would end the rubber-stamping of these projects. Got that, Mr. President?The Energy Department is required by law to approve permits to export LNG to countries with which the U.S. doesnt have free-trade agreements if they are in the public interest. The department has never rejected a permit. But now the Administration plans to do so by redefining public interest to include the potential impact on the climate.The White House says the pause will only affect a handful of projects that are currently seeking Energy Department permits, but this is dishonest. It will also freeze about a half a dozen projects seeking Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approvals and could halt another dozen or so that have been permitted by previous Presidents.Thats because the Energy Department in December announced that projects not yet operating will have to reapply for permits if its been seven years since they were authorized. So projects in the works could get deep-sixedeven if they have billions of dollars in committed capital and contractual agreements with customers.While the Administration downplays the national-security risks of its self-embargo, U.S. allies worry it will make them more vulnerable to geopolitical disruptions. About 20% of the global LNG supply travels through the Strait of Hormuz. LNG cargoes to Europe are now being diverted from the Red Sea because of Houthi missile attacks.Russian and Iranian proxies could cause LNG prices to spike by attacking one or two large Qatar export facilities. Some countries in Asia might then burn more coal as they did in 2022 when LNG prices shot up. But Europeans are planning to retire coal and nuclear plants in the coming years on the expectation that they will have ample LNG from the U.S.As for Americas economic interests, a single LNG export project will produce about $600 billion in revenue over its lifespan and create thousands of jobs, including in steel manufacturing and frackingno government subsidies required.Venture Globals Gulf Coast CP2 could supply about 5% of the worlds LNG by 2026 and would have a bigger impact on the U.S. economy than any green energy project. It would also reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by 140 million tons a yearabout as much as all container ships in the world produce. But it still needs an Energy Department permit.Remember Nancy Pelosis famous line that Democrats had to pass ObamaCare to learn what was in it? Democrats in Sacramento are now having second thoughts about a law they passed two years ago that would effectively establish a second progressive income tax in California.Democrats last week introduced legislation to repeal a 2022 budget bill that authorized the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to restructure electricity rates by imposing a fixed charge on an income-graduated basis. The budget bills purpose was to reduce the states skyrocketing rates for lower-income people and shift utility costs to higher earners.One culprit is the states aggressive green-energy buildout, which has required batteries to back up intermittent solar and wind. Another is the states net-metering program, which generously compensates households with solar panels for excess power they send to the grid. This has shifted costs for maintaining the grid to homes without solar panels.Lawmakers have also shifted state government costs for wildfire mitigation and climate subsidies to utilities so the politicians can devote more spending to their public-union friends. At the same time the state has mandated that utilities provide discounts to lower-income customers. These discounts get baked into higher rates for all customers.The climate lobby frets that soaring electricity rates will discourage low- and middle-income Californians from buying electric vehicles (though they are also an inducement to install solar panels). Thus, Gov. Gavin Newsom two years ago pressured the Legislature to pass the budget bill to establish the nations first income-based electricity rates.The PUC hasnt finalized the new electric rate structures. But Pacific Gas & Electric Company has floated charging customers fixed fees ranging from $15 a month for those earning less than $28,000 annually and up to $92 a month for those making $180,000 or more. Income-based charges on higher earners will rise as utility costs do.Ten state Senators recently sent a letter urging the PUC to reject utilities proposed income charges. Californians already pay some of the highest electric bills in the nation and should not be forced to arbitrarily pay more to cover for a private utilitys poor business decisions, San Francisco progressive Sen. Scott Wiener declared.Nothey will be forced to pay more to compensate for Sacramentos bad policy decisions. The progressive epiphany in Sacramento is welcome, belated as it may be. Maybe California isnt completely lost.What people want  if it runs counter to the political direction mapped out by the elected dictatorship  is often described crudely as populism  something that is popular with the majority of voting people.As The Guardians Timothy Garton Ash put it:When I see the term populism used, I know the author is referring to a movement the author he or she doesnt like. That is what it does. It signals to the listener that the thing they are deprecating is to be deprecated.Back n the 80s an organization attempting to get a constitutional proposition onto the Californai ballet to force a change in income tax basis and regulations led whit the declaration that no economic activity is of any value save by virtue of being controlled by government, therefore government has an intrinsic right to part of every transaction.Im 69, retired from a fairly demanding technical career. My preference would be to (as the Indians charmingly say go F off now). But it seems I have to learn about this vast subject. Its not simple or easy. I dont enter the fray, as Im not competent enough to make useful comments. Ive my gut feel (which has been pretty reliable IME) about the whole climate thing  its a monstrous fraud. In the end, its driven by human weaknesses  egotism and greed.With his computer-assisted mathematical models and political connections, Song caught the attention of top leaders. He argued that rapid population growth would prevent China from becoming a rich, modern country,The problem with many models, but especially climate and in this case population models, is that they take a single factor and to the exclusion of everything else, assume that this single factor is the only one that matters.  Not just for now, but far into the future.This just came across my feed. This is whats happening in the north Mojave Desert. If this sticks, Id say Mojave Pistachio (a billion dollar operation) will pull out as $30 million per year fee for pumping 15,000 acre-feet isnt going to make a profit (sarc). Ive no sympathy for MP, at all. You had to be here to understand the ruthless tactics this company used to exploit CA water law and try to crush this community  they really do intend to suck all of the water out without any consideration of the 30,000 people who live here.Ive plenty of misgivings about all of this, I dont like some of the language in this court ruling  it smacks of ever-increasing government power. On the other hand, Im one of the small and weak that was being crushed by this heartless corporation. I doubt these fees will ever be used to bring more water into the basin, but Im hoping this is a stake through the heart of this water vampire, And the enviable coming water crisis is at least delayed.FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Carol Thomas-Keefer 650-587-7300 X17 cthomaskeefer@rgs.ca.gov COURT OF APPEALS RULES IN FAVOR OF INDIAN WELLS VALLEY GROUNDWATER AUTHORITY IN FEE CHALLENGE BROUGHT BY DESERT PISTACHIO GROWERFebruary 8, 2024  Ridgecrest, CA  In a groundbreaking published opinion described as having great public importance that could impact thousands of water users throughout the state for years to come, the California Court of Appeals denied a request to avoid paying a fee needed to preserve groundwater resources brought by a farmer that used the water to grow pistachio trees in an arid desert. The court also barred any claims for damages associated with the imposition of the fee and questioned the farmers right to use water in such a seemingly frivolous manner.The dispute arose based on a replenishment fee adopted by the Indian Wells Valley Groundwater Authority (IWVGA). The Authority was formed by Kern County, Inyo County, San Bernardino County, the Indian Wells Valley Water District, and the City of Ridgecrest to address the critical overdraft of the Indian Wells Valley Groundwater Basin, which spans approximately 600 square miles across parts of Kern, Inyo, and San Bernardino Counties. With no significant surface water or importation infrastructure, the basin is the regions sole source of water. The Department of Water Resources has identified the basin as critically overdrafted, with groundwater levels declining since 1945. The IWVGA estimates a loss of groundwater storage of about 25,000 acre-feet per year.Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, the largest landholding by the U.S. Navy globally, is situated within the basin, accounting for a portion of groundwater extraction. The remaining area supports residential and agricultural activities, including the party that brought the lawsuit, Mojave Pistachios, which cultivates pistachios in this arid region. Mojave Pistachio claimed the legal right to use nearly all of the available water to support its nut cultivation.The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) mandates the creation of groundwater sustainability plans. IWVGAs plan explained that the Basin is solely dependent on groundwater; current outflows are about four times the estimated inflows; groundwater levels are dropping by up to 2.5 feet annually; the Basin does not currently have access to imported water; and up to 50 miles of infrastructure must be built to import water. To finance this critical infrastructure, IWVGA determined the need for a fee from those benefiting from the projects. Ordinance No. 03-20, effective January 2021, instituted a Basin replenishment fee of $2,130 per acre-foot. From 2021 to the present, Mojave has continued to pump water from the basin at an alarming rate while failing to pay the fee  claiming instead that payment was unnecessary because the fee was an illegal infringement on their water rights.In a sharply written, published legal opinion, the California Court of Appeals disagreed. The court confirmed the trial courts prior decision to throw out Mojaves legal claims against the fee. In doing so, the court applied the pay first, litigate later rule, which is a principle that requires taxpayers to pay a disputed tax before they can challenge it in court. The pay first rule is important because it allows for the continuation of revenue collection during litigation, ensuring that government operations reliant on such funds are not interrupted.Before today, no court had determined whether the pay first rule applied in cases challenging fees imposed by a groundwater sustainability agency under SGMA. In a first of its kind decision, the court applied the pay first rule to the replenishment fee, stating that any legal challenge to the fee, which is aimed at managing the critically overdrafted groundwater basin, must be preceded by the payment of the fee, even if the fee is contested as violating SGMA or California water law.As the court noted: If groundwater extractors like Mojave can challenge a fee without first paying it, that could defeat SGMAs goal of managing overdrafted groundwater basins. The court also found that Mojave Pistachios could not pursue any damages claims against the Authority based on the fee as these claims had also been waived.In a stunning rebuke of Mojave Pistachios claims about the size of the fee the court noted Benjamin Franklins famous quote: When the wells dry, we know the worth of water. The court reminded them that the fee was not even very high given the costs it intended to pay. The Replenishment Fee . . . is not grossly out of line with the fees charged by other agencies.In the most striking part of the decision the court also questioned whether Mojave Pistachios even had any right to water in the first place. The court noted that groundwater belongs to the state, not any person or entity and that water rights holders have the right to take and use water, but they do not own the water and cannot waste it . The court asked: Is using the Basins limited groundwater to irrigate a water-intensive crop like pistachios in the middle of the high desert a reasonable and beneficial use of water protected under the California Constitution, particularly considering most of those trees were planted less than 10 years ago?With this issue now settled, the Authority will renew its legal motion to require Mojave Pistachios to pay fees for the water that it has improperly used. The Authority will seek to have this matter resolved in the next few months. ### Note: This press release is for informational purposes only and does not reflect any legal advice or opinion on the ongoing legal proceedings
safe,MANILA, Philippines  The long-term nuclear plan outlined by the Department of Energy (DOE) is too long, too late due to the climate emergency, a climate analyst said, suggesting instead the prioritization of building renewable energy facilities.Prioritize renewable energy, primarily solar and wind as the alternative to fossil fuels because solar and wind are ready now and there is no need to wait 10 years, Asian Peoples Movement on Debt and Development (APMDD) senior lead Paolo Pagaduan told The STAR.We have to make sure its safe, that theres no risk of us getting into a disaster. We need to follow each and every rule because if you are rushing because you want it fast, then you might bypass some other requirements, Garin told The STAR.The design and construction also needed to be factored in, particularly the standard materials in building the power plant. Since the Philippines is a member of the IAEA, the construction of nuclear energy facilities must be pursuant to the international guidelines.
safe,Police in Mersin, Turkey, confirmed on Tuesday that they had arrested an unnamed man working at the construction site of the Russian-built Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant in connection with an investigation into the Islamic State.According to a translation of a Mersin police statement by the Turkish outlet Duvar, authorities said that the person in question was an employee at the future nuclear power plant site and had obtained work there using a false identity. The person was identified only by the initials U.A. and allegedly found to be a Russian citizen, though some reports conflict with that information and state that his nationality remains publicly unknown.An aerial view of the Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) construction site as the first unit is planned to deploy after the preparation, pretesting and arriving of the nuclear fuel to the site on Apr. 27, in Mersin, Turkey, on April 19, 2023. (Ercin Erturk/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)Rosatom, Russias state nuclear power company, is in charge of the construction of the Akkuyu facility. Once completed, it will be Turkeys first nuclear power plant. Islamist President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has celebrated the project as elevating Turkeys geopolitical profile by allowing it to enter the club of nuclear-capable states and the plant as boasting state-of-the-art security features.The police announcementof the Islamic State-linked detention on Tuesday included photos of the man being arrested, but no specifics on why, aside from the use of fake identification, he was detained or what kind of criminal charges he may face. It is unclear at press time what the mans job was at the Akkuyu site. Police also did not directly state if the man was believed to be a member of the Islamic State, only that his arrest occurred within the scope of the work carried out by our Intelligence and Counter-Terrorism Branch Directorates against the Islamic State.The arrest has raised alarm in Turkey, which experienced its first terrorist attack attributed to the Islamic State in seven years in late January. Two terrorists opened fire on Catholics congregating for Mass in Istanbuls Santa Maria Church on January 28, killing one person. Eyewitnesses said the low death count appeared to be in part the result of at least one of the guns used in the attack jamming.The Islamic States Amaq news agency confirmed that the attackers belonged to the Sunni jihadist terrorist group, applauding them for havingattacked a gathering of Christian unbelievers during their polytheistic ceremony.Turkish authorities identified the two gunmen as citizens of Russia and Tajikistan and subsequently engaged in police raids against individuals suspected of having played a role in the attack. Turkish police announced on January 30 that they had arrested 47 people as a result of investigations into the church shooting. As of last week, the number of people arrested for alleged ties to the Islamic State in Turkey has risen to 147.Prior to the shooting in January, Turkeys most recent Islamic State terrorist attack occurred on the New Years Eve welcoming 2017. An Islamic State terrorist later identified as Usbek national Abdulkadir Masharipov stormed Istanbuls Reina nightclub during one of its busiest nights and opened first, killing 39 people and injuring dozens of others. Masharipov reportedly confessed to the shooting.In this Wednesday, Jan. 4, 2017, file photo, a man adjusts a victims photograph displayed with floral tributes and Turkish flags, outside the Reina night club following the New Years day attack, in Istanbul. (AP Photo/Emrah Gurel, file)The Reina nightclub attack occurred a little less than six months after the 2016 bombing of Istanbuls Atatrk Airport. Unlike the nightclub shooting, no individual or group ever took responsibility for the attack, later described as a triple suicide bombing, but Turkish police said evidence indicated that it was an Islamic State operation.While Turkey had not experienced any mass-casualty Islamic State terrorist attacks since 2017, Turkish officials consistently described the group as a threat and occasionally announced operations against suspected jihadists. A month before the Istanbul church shooting, the Turkish Interior Ministry announced that it had detained 304 people in a wave of police raids nationwide, all suspected of some association with the Islamic State.The arrest on Tuesday has raised concerns about a potential terrorist attack targeting the nuclear power plant site, which has been plagued by setbacks and controversy for nearly a decade and technically conceived of almost half a century ago. Turkish authorities first issued a license to build a nuclear energy facility at the site in 1976 but reconsidered the project following the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster, according to the Associated Press. Turkey first held a groundbreaking ceremony at the Akkuyu site in 2015 and claimed that Rosatom would complete the project by at the earliest 2022.Shortly after the announcement of construction beginning, the Turkish military shot down a Russian warplane over Syria, chilling relations between the two countries and prompting global concern that Erdogan had inadvertently dragged NATO, of which Turkey is a member, into conflict with Russia. Ankara and Moscow ultimately resolved the tensions  stemming from Russias support of Syrian dictator Bashar Assad, whose regime Erdogan had at one time promised to end  and Erdogan announced the groundbreaking of Akkuyu for a second time in 2018.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan waits for the start of a round table meeting of the North Atlantic Council during a NATO summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, on July 11, 2023. (AP Photo/Mindaugas Kulbis, File)Construction continued quietly, with the exception of protests from anti-nuclear power activists, for years, but 2022 came and went without completion of the plant. In early 2023, Turkey experienced one of the worst natural disasters in its history: a series of earthquakes that killed upwards of 40,000 people near the border with Syria. The earthquakes renewed anxiety surrounding Akkuyu, which is located about 200 miles from the epicenter of the largest of the earthquakes. Authorities insisted, however, that the power plant was being built with protective measures to keep it safe and operational in the face of much larger tremors than those experienced in 2023 in the region.

I would now like to turn the call over to Scott Rowe, Flowserves President and Chief Executive Officer, for his prepared comments.Scott Rowe: Thanks, Jen, and good morning, everyone. Flowserves fourth quarter performance marked a strong finish to a very solid year of improved execution and consistent progress. Our financial and operating performance throughout 2023 supported raising our full year revenue and adjusted EPS guidance 3 different times as we significantly exceeded our original expectations. For the full year, we achieved year-over-year revenue growth of nearly 20%, driven by enhanced backlog conversion and operational improvement while delivering higher adjusted gross and operating margins. As a result, our adjusted earnings per share increased by over 90%, and our operating cash flow improved by over $360 million compared to 2022. Bookings exceeded $4.25 billion for just the second time since 2016, which supported our strong year-end backlog of $2.7 billion. Most importantly, Flowserve entered 2024 well positioned to drive continued momentum and success, and we are well on our way towards achieving our 2027 financial targets that were communicated last September. I want to sincerely thank all of our associates around the world for their efforts and dedication throughout the year. Our commitment to serving our customers and their passion for our business are critical to driving exceptional financial results. Im very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, including our adjusted earnings per share of $0.68, which brought our full year adjusted EPS to $2.10. We are seeing the impact of our improved operating model higher backlog conversion and significantly better financial performance. These improvements drove fourth quarter sales of nearly $1.2 billion and expanded our sequential adjusted operating margins to 10.5%. We also delivered $195 million of operating cash flow during the quarter, which was driven primarily by our earnings and strong working capital performance. This was a clear highlight for us as we are beginning to deliver improvements in our inventory management as our supply chain continues to normalize and lead times shorten. Our markets remain supportive as we delivered over $1 billion in bookings for the eighth consecutive quarter. While our full year 2023 book-to-bill was just below 1.0x, our backlog remains at a very healthy $2.7 billion as we entered 2024. Let me now provide some additional color on our fourth quarter bookings. General market activity remains high, and we generated bookings of $1.04 billion in the quarter. We achieved this level due to the success of our 3D growth strategy, coupled with continued high levels of aftermarket and MRO activity that we captured around the world despite the lack of a major project award. We did obtain a significant number of smaller awards in the $5 million to $10 million range which together totaled roughly $100 million across all industries and regions. Our largest project award was only $9 million in the fourth quarter. We remain disciplined on our project pricing approach and margin expectations. While this strategy may result in some lost incremental awards, we are confident that we will ultimately create more value with this selective bidding approach. Our 3D bookings represented roughly 30% of our total awards during the quarter, where we saw particular strength with LNG, nuclear and water awards. While some of the larger projects we previously expected to be awarded during the fourth quarter were delayed, they remain viable and healthy opportunities for Flowserve in 2024. For full year 2023, our bookings were nearly $4.3 billion. Turning to our aftermarket business. Most of our customers facilities continue to operate with high utilization rates. While their focus remains on reliability, efficiency and emissions reductions, we are positioned well to capture the aftermarket and MRO business associated with this type of work. For the ninth consecutive quarter, we generated over $500 million in aftermarket bookings. For the full year, our aftermarket bookings were nearly $2.3 billion, which were up 5% year-over-year. More importantly, we see the elevated demand for our higher-margin quicker turn aftermarket offerings continuing into 2024. Our overall market outlook for 2024 is very encouraging given the project opportunities and aftermarket trends we are seeing today. We believe the themes of energy security and decarbonization will continue to drive global spending for years to come. At year-end, our total project funnel has increased 13% versus prior year enabling us to remain disciplined and selective in the new project work we pursue. Our oil and gas funnel is up 25% year-over-year, driven primarily by mid and downstream activity in the Middle East, where were we are well positioned to capitalize on the significant investment in the region. Furthermore, our energy transition project funnel also increased nearly 25% year-over-year driven by decarbonization activities in the pursuit of clean energy. We believe we can secure enhanced project bookings in 2024, given the visibility that we have in our forward funnel. Beyond projects, we anticipate our aftermarket and MRO business to remain at elevated levels and support our growth into 2024 and beyond. We continue to see healthy activity levels despite some of the softening consumer trends and economic uncertainty that are highly publicized. Additionally, we are seeing signs of stability in areas that were depressed in 2023 like European chemicals. Our global install base is incredibly large and we have further opportunity to improve our aftermarket capture rates as we go forward. Overall, we believe that our global network of quick response centers combined with our commitment to serve our customers with speed and high levels of service will allow us to grow our aftermarket franchise further in 2024. I will now turn the call over to Amy to address our fourth quarter and full year financial results in greater detail.Amy Schwetz: Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Let me also start by saying how pleased I am with our fourth quarter results, which demonstrated continued operational momentum, disciplined cost management and strong cash generation. For the fourth quarter, we achieved our best quarterly sales level since 2015, an adjusted operating margin of 10.5%, our highest quarter of the year and $0.68 of adjusted earnings per share. Our operating cash flow was also strong at $195 million in the quarter, representing a year-over-year improvement of $125 million. These results continued our recent trend of sequential quarterly improvement across many areas, which led to our outstanding full year 2023 results. Starting with other details in the quarter. Our reported earnings per share were $0.47, which included $0.21 of net adjusted expenses, primarily below the line FX impacts and realignment charges. Improved operating performance drove a 12% increase in revenues over prior year, comprised of FPDs and FCDs growth of 13% and 11%, respectively. We also generated strong top line growth in both original equipment and aftermarket, with revenue increases of 15% and 9%, respectively. Many of our regions contributed to the double-digit sales growth as well, with notable year-over-year improvement in the Middle East and Africa, North America and Europe, of 27%, 14% and 13% respectively. Shifting to margins. We generated adjusted gross margins of 29.8% during the quarter, a 100 basis point increase compared to the prior years fourth quarter despite higher performance-based compensation expense and the modest mix shift to original equipment. The margin improvement was driven by increased sales leverage, benefits from our new operating model and continued traction with operational excellence initiatives and an improving supply chain environment. At a segment level, we are particularly pleased to see FCD realize its highest quarterly adjusted gross margins since 2019. At 32.2%, representing a 310 basis point year-over-year improvement. On a reported basis, fourth quarter consolidated gross margins increased 70 basis points to 29.1%. Despite the net increase in realignment and asset write-downs of $4.1 million, versus prior year. Fourth quarter adjusted SG&A increased $39 million to $230 million compared to last year. The increase was primarily due to $13 million in higher year-over-year performance-based incentive compensation and an increase in bad debt of $6 million as well as some benefits in 2022 that did not recur this year, such as the $9 million legal settlement and a small gain on an asset sale of $4 million. Despite these somewhat discrete items, adjusted SG&A as a percent of sales was 19.7%, driven by solid operating leverage during the quarter. On a reported basis, fourth quarter SG&A increased year-over-year by $41 million to $235 million. In addition to the items just mentioned, our reported amount also includes a net $2 million increase in adjusted items, primarily from realignment expenses. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 10.5%, just 30 basis points lower compared to prior year. While our adjusted gross margins this quarter were essentially equivalent to those of the 2023 third quarter, I am very pleased that the sequential adjusted operating margins expanded by 180 basis points for a nearly 40% sequential incremental. On a reported basis, fourth quarter operating margins decreased 70 basis points year-over-year to 9.4%. Due to higher performance-based incentive compensation, the onetime discrete SG&A items previously discussed and a $6 million increase in adjusted items compared to the prior year, again primarily related to the realignment actions. Our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate of 7.8% was notably lower than expected, primarily due to the release of valuation allowance on certain net foreign deferred tax assets. Our reported rate of 5.6% reflects the items just mentioned as well as the tax impact associated with realignment charges, which we excluded from our adjusted results. Turning to our full year results. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.10, a 91% increase year-over-year. The performance exceeded our latest revised guidance range from October of $1.95 to $2.05 and with nearly 30% above the midpoint of our initial 2023 target range we provided this time a year ago. Our full year 2023 revenues were over $4.3 billion, up nearly 20% compared to the prior year as our backlog conversion cadence significantly improved with our operational performance. On this sales level, we generated adjusted gross margins of 30.1% for the year, modestly exceeding our prior expectations. Importantly, we remain confident in our ability to expand margins further by accelerating our operational excellence initiatives and ongoing product management of our portfolio. Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales was 20.9% for the year, representing our lowest level since 2015. This performance was driven by our focus on cost containment, including the benefits from our recent cost-out program and organizational redesign as well as increasing top line leverage. While we are pleased with the progress we have made to date, we know that the work on this front is never done, and we will remain focused on driving even better results. Our full year adjusted operating margin was 9.5%, a meaningful increase of 330 basis points over the prior year. Both FCD and FPD delivered solid 2023 performance, keeping pace with significant increases in adjusted segment operating margin of roughly 320 and 330 basis points, respectively, to 14% and 12.4%. Looking ahead, we are well positioned towards our longer-term 2027 consolidated adjusted operating margin target of 14% to 16% that we shared at our Analyst Day in September. Our adjusted tax rate of 15.1% for the full year finished below our previous expectations, primarily driven by the release of valuation allowances on specific foreign net deferred tax assets as we believe those benefits will now be realized based on our improving financial results and help mitigate future cash taxes. Turning now to cash flow. We delivered outstanding full year operating cash flow of $326 million, which represented a nearly $366 million year-over-year improvement. In addition to our higher earnings, Im also very pleased that we improved cash from working capital by nearly $240 million, and our cash conversion cycle decreased by roughly 10 days compared to 2022. During the fourth quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $195 million, an increase of $125 million compared to the prior year. The improvement can largely be attributed to our strong working capital performance. Accounts receivable was a modest source of cash this quarter despite our increased revenues, but represented a $77 million improvement compared to the prior year. Collections results have been robust all year. But notably are evidenced by the nearly 7-day reduction in our day sales outstanding year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Inventory also contributed to working capital progress as weve reduced the cash used by over $50 million for both the fourth quarter and the full year compared to the respective periods of 2022. As a percent of sales, we improved our year-end primary working capital by approximately 450 basis points to 27.9% and improved sequentially by 260 basis points as well. We made great strides towards reducing our working capital and investment to our 25% to 27% long-term target and it will remain a major focus area for us going forward. Capital expenditures were $20 million during the quarter, bringing this years free cash flow to $175 million. This year-over-year improvement exceeds $100 million and resulted in a free cash flow to adjusted net income conversion of 194%. Other significant uses of cash in the fourth quarter included $26 million for dividends and a $10 million term loan reduction. Turning to our 2024 outlook. We expect to continue building on our operating momentum to deliver full year revenue growth of 4% to 6%, with adjusted earnings per share between $2.40 to $2.60, both consistent with the qualitative guidance we provided at our September Analyst Day. At the midpoint, our 2024 adjusted earnings guidance represents a roughly 20% increase over last year. As Scott mentioned, our markets continue to remain active, and we expect to generate a full year book-to-bill ratio over 1x, building backlog to spur multiyear revenue growth. We also expect net interest expense in the range of $60 million to $65 million and an adjusted tax rate of approximately 20%. Our adjusted targets exclude expected realignment expenses of approximately $30 million as well as other potential items that may occur during the year, such as below-the-line foreign currency effects and the impact of other discrete items. Including the potential realignment spending, we expect our reported EPS to be in the range of $2.25 to $2.45 per share. Similar to last year, we will work to minimize top line reduction as we move from the sequentially strong last quarter of the year to the first quarter. That said, we would anticipate our general trend of seasonality and earnings will continue in 2024, with the first quarter being our lowest earnings quarter of the year and the fourth quarter being the strongest. We intend to further drive value creation through our capital allocation approach. As we weigh opportunities to allocate capital, we are guided by our enduring framework to deploy excess cash to the highest long-term return while remaining impartial as to how value is created. Our Board has authorized a 5% increase to our dividend to $0.21 per share. Additionally, the Board also replenished our authorized share repurchase capacity to $300 million. As we indicated at the Analyst Day, we view share repurchases to offset equity compensation as a commitment and with the increased capacity of the new plan, we also can act opportunistically. That said, we believe there are ample opportunities to invest in the business, both through internal programs and inorganic growth. We expect capital expenditures between $75 million and $85 million this year, and we are well positioned to pursue M&A opportunities to further expand our portfolio of flow control offerings to better support and accelerate our 3D strategy. We are most interested in targets that provide the opportunity to leverage our scale and that can be effectively integrated with our broader business. Financial discipline and economic returns are table stakes. So the returns on any acquisition would be in excess of our average cost of capital as well as the margin and cash EPS accretive. Through it all, our capital allocation approach is designed to maintain our investment-grade rating, and we intend to reduce our term loan by $60 million this year. I am proud of the strong foundation we established during 2023 and feel confident that we can drive continued margin and earnings per share growth, while deploying capital to deliver long-term shareholder value as we progress towards our longer-term targets. I fully expect 2024 to be a great start on that journey. Let me now return the call to Scott.Scott Rowe: Great. Thank you, Amy. Let me now offer a few comments on our 3D strategy. which, as we discussed at our September Analyst Day, is directly aligned with the market environment that we see today and in the future. The strategy is intended to drive accelerated growth for years to come. While we are well suited to serve our customer base today, we are continuing to invest in product and service offerings, including through potential inorganic opportunities that further build our portfolio to support diverse markets in the new emerging sources of energy. Let me start with Diversified where our bookings remain very healthy in 2023 as we continue to apply our portfolio into served end markets that present an above-average growth profile. Our vacuum pump products are a great example of our efforts and represent a significant component of the diversification pillar. Our focus to grow our vacuum products in general industrial applications has delivered outsized growth over the last several years. In the fourth quarter, we were selected to supply dry vacuum pumps for a state-of-the-art marine solvents production facility in Europe that will support the circular economy. The site will convert biomass waste into 1,000 metric tons of non-toxic solvents annually to be utilized in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, electronics and other applications. Moving to decarbonize. We produced another quarter of strong bookings led by nuclear and LNG awards. We remain excited about the nuclear outlook as countries around the globe are focused on providing clean and reliable energy within their borders. We continue to be very optimistic on the nuclear outlook as countries begin to develop investment plans that have nuclear energy output tripling by 2050. Our strong portfolio of nuclear pumps, valves and seals are well positioned to meet this growing demand, including life extensions on existing assets and the building of new nuclear power facilities in Asia and Europe. New energy applications are another key driver behind our decarbonized initiative. Flowserve was recently selected to supply our specialty ball valves to support the production of liquid green hydrogen in the United States. This project is expected to produce nearly 11,000 tons of hydrogen to enable operations for one of the worlds largest e-commerce companies. Lastly, on digitize. We believe our ability to digitize our solutions and leverage our large installed base and aftermarket capabilities will enable Flowserve to be better equipped to provide true solutions for our customers. We believe our offering is at an inflection point of growth, and we have significant visibility to new installations. We now have over 80 customer locations using Red Raven (NASDAQ:RAVN) technology with almost 2,100 assets instrumented. We remain committed to adding value to our customers with this digital offering by instrumenting pumps and valves to monitor, predict and ultimately better optimize the full flow loop. Flowserve have recently partnered with three European-based petrochemical facilities to increase reliability and efficiency with our Red Raven technology. We are pleased to continue expanding our IoT presence in petrochemicals, an industry where we are seeing an increasing level of acceptance, providing us with an opportunity to offer more of our solutions portfolio and capabilities to help solve our customers toughest flow control challenges. In conclusion, Im extremely pleased with our progress in 2023. The new organization design is driving enhanced execution, improved accountability and is allowing us to operate with speed. This new design better supports our 3D strategy and will allow Flowserve to further our advantage in securing the market opportunities in front of us. Im confident in our ability to maintain the momentum created in 2023 and continue driving improvements in 2024 and beyond. The trajectory to our longer-term financial goals outlined at our Analyst Day begins with the delivery of our 2024 targets, including 4% to 6% revenue growth, more than 100 basis points adjusted operating margin improvement and roughly 20% adjusted EPS growth at the midpoint of our guidance. Finally, I am pleased that our efforts and strategy continue to be recognized by third-party organizations. In recent weeks, Flowserve was named by the Newsweek as one of Americas most responsible companies and we are named in Forbes list of most successful mid-cap companies in 2024. The financial and operational performance we delivered last year creates a solid foundation to build upon, and I am excited about the opportunities for Flowserve in 2024. We have substantially improved our ability to execute and serve our customers, and Im confident that this progress will carry into 2024 as we expect to deliver another significant year of improved financial results. We are fully focused this year on profitably converting our near-record $2.7 billion backlog, continuing our pursuit of outsized growth driven by our 3D strategy, and driving higher operating margins through further operational improvements. We remain committed to driving long-term value for our associates, customers and shareholders. Operator, this concludes our prepared remarks and we would now like to open the call to questions.Nathan Jones: Im going to start with the questions on the bookings outlook. I think, Amy, in your prepared remarks, you talked about a book-to-bill above 1. Scott, you talked about growth in the pipeline. I think the book-to-bill above 1 kind of implies mid to high single-digit bookings growth. So  just any more color you can give us on how that splits out between projects and aftermarket? What kind of projects are in the pipeline and the confidence that those will convert to orders this year?Scott Rowe: Sure. Yes. Its a really good question, Nathan. Let me start with aftermarket and then Ill go to kind of traditional end markets, and Ill touch on projects as well. On the aftermarket side, we saw tremendous growth in 2023. We delivered about 5% for the full Flowserve and we expect that to continue. And so when we look at utilization rates and we look at kind of whats happening with the customer installations, we see that, that aftermarket work will continue as we go forward. And then secondly, we believe theres an ability to drive our capture rate up. Were  we dont disclose what that rate is. But what Ill say is we know we have opportunities to do better there. And in the Analyst Day, we outlined some of those opportunities, both on the pump side and the valve side. And so we believe weve got kind of market share or capture rate opportunities on top of what well say is a very constructive environment for our aftermarket business. So we see something similar to 2023 in terms of growing that side of the business. And then like the Analyst Day or within the Analyst Day, we talked about our traditional end markets, and we showed kind of some like more GDP-type results at this 3% to 5% growth for those end markets. And again, when we look at our model, nothing has changed there. And so we see reasonably good growth on the traditional end markets across the board. And then where we see really exciting growth is in the new energy and the decarbonization side. And so thats where we see that outsized growth above that kind of 3% to 5%. And we had a really good year in 2023 across all aspects of our business in terms of bookings growth with the exception of large projects. And so when we look at our project funnel, what we see is the project funnel overall is up 13%. Our oil and gas funnel is up 25%, and that decarbonization of new energy is up 25%. And so that gives us a lot of confidence on our project outlook and making sure that we can acquire and win awards that makes sense on our margins and value creation. And so Id say, overall, we feel really good about where we are in terms of the overall market and the outlook. And I think we can  at this point, we believe that we can deliver certainly above 1.0 on our book-to-bill and drive to that 5% growth target that we put out in the Analyst Day.Nathan Jones: One follow-up on orders and specifically, the oil and gas pipeline being up 25%. Thats obviously still your biggest end market. And so thats 1 that could move the needle. And probably where the large projects are as well. Does this above 1.0 include the conversion of any large projects? Or would those be kind of gravy on top and whats your confidence that they actually get awarded in 24.Scott Rowe: Yes. The project market in oil and gas has stacked up pretty substantially. Its primarily delivered  or primarily in the Middle East. And I was there 3 weeks ago  and quite frankly, I was overwhelmed with the amount of work thats out there and the spending thats happening. Now obviously, things could change that  but I would say with Saudis 2030 vision with what we see in the rest of the region across countries like the UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, the activity is substantial. And so to your question directly, theres a long list of large projects out there. If we get two or three of those, that would be gravy to compare to what were talking about, but I would say there are a couple of those projects that are kind of more moderate size that are embedded in our growth projections. But again, we feel good about it. Weve been very selective, specifically in 2023 in terms of what we want to win. Weve been very disciplined in that approach. And I feel really good that were going to start to win some work, but when work that makes sense from a margin perspective and value creation perspective.Mike Halloran: Maybe we just follow-up on the comment you just made there. Certainly, understand the diligence behind project selection and where you want to win and focus on the margins. But when you take a step back, how would you describe the overall competitive landscape right now, given the amount of opportunity out there, you see a little bit more diligence from some of the competitor base or just a little bit more logical pricing mechanisms? Or is it still pretty project by project? Any thought on that side?Scott Rowe: Sure. If we compare it to  lets go to 2 years ago when folks were very, very hungry for work. The environment is substantially better than that. But what Ill say is the project environment is always attractive. Everybody wants to bid and participate in it. And so it remains somewhat challenging. And so through our selected bidding approach, what were looking at is customers we know we can work with, customers where we know that we can deliver the margin expectations that we signed up for in the bidding phase. And then were also looking for making sure that we can get the aftermarket associated with the work there. And so I think thats probably the biggest change for us is really getting a more holistic look at what we wanted to work or what we want to work on geographically, but then also with the customers in supporting that aftermarket. And then when we think about the competitive landscape, everybody is substantially fuller in terms of capacity than what we saw 2 years ago. We are seeing discipline improve pretty substantially, but every now and then, well get a surprise by somebody that doesnt kind of stay in that disciplined approach. And well just accept that and move on and make sure that we can win work thats more suitable to the margin expectations that we deserve.Mike Halloran: Great. Makes sense. And then good to see the cash generation this quarter. Could you maybe talk to the 24 expectations that layer it as well usage of that cash, the buyback authorization [indiscernible] certainly here in these remarks around it. Is there any more intent there to be opportunistic? And how do you see the M&A landscape with the cash generation?Amy Schwetz: Sure. So Id start with our expectations continue to continue to generate nice levels of cash as we move into 2024. At the Analyst Day, we talked about kind of a guiding principal between 80% and 100% free cash flow conversion, I think well be at the low end or slightly below that in 2024, just given some of the realignment activities that we expect to continue to occur. In terms of capital allocation, I think that what we wanted to do with this most recent action with the Board is to really just increase the opportunity set that we have out there modest dividend increase, acknowledging that we had not had an increase in our dividend level since early in 2020. And then again, at the Analyst Day, we had recommitted to the practice of share buybacks to offset equity dilution. Weve not done that in the last couple of years. So we want the opportunity to be able to do that. So thats probably a little bit of catch-up this year. I will say, overall, I think that our bias, which needs to be tested each time we have the opportunity is to invest those dollars either in internal growth or inorganic growth to boost really our top line, find opportunities that are accretive to margins and EPS and ultimately grow earnings for our shareholders. But I think that with the actions the Board took this year, we have an opportunity to have a full suite of options available to us as we make our way into 2024.Sabrina Abrams: So, some of your competitors have talked about seeing 100 bps to 200 bps of better margin backlog relative to whats shipping through the P&L today. Is that a fair framework for what Flowserve is shipping in 2024 relative to its P&L?Amy Schwetz: I would say we definitely see improvement in the pricing of our backlog, and some of that is obviously dependent on mix that you currently have in our backlog. But I think that we see that margin in backlog as a real tailwind for us going into 2024.Sabrina Abrams: Got it. And as a follow-up, I guess I am thinking about the different components of the margins. So, you have better pricing in the backlog. There is the mix benefit from aftermarket outgrowing OE and some incremental benefit from the restructuring program. So, if you could talk about maybe the different components, the good guys and bad guys and the margin bridge for 2024. Just want to understand the components of the 100 bps of expansion that you guys are guiding to?Amy Schwetz: Sure. So, I will start by saying we are confident in our ability to expand margins by the 100 basis points or more. And as we think about our guidance range, I would say our ability to move towards the high end of that range would likely mean margin expansion above that 100 basis points versus volume growth, given that we saw sales volume growth of nearly 20% in 2023. So, where we are at in terms of puts and takes, neutral from a  to a slightly positive on price-cost from a material inflation standpoint, and you have already touched on the margin in backlog, which we see as a positive. And we do have the structural cost savings from both the org redesign that we put in place and the activities that are taking shape with respect to op excellence. In terms of whats working against us in 2024, I would start with labor inflation is something that will begin to take hold kind of late in the first quarter and really start to show up in the second quarter of the year. And then although we do have a nice backlog of aftermarket mix, I think the mix of project work is going to be something that we will be monitoring and watching closely in terms of margin expectations in 2024. And I would start with what Scott has described as a large funnel of FPD large project work that we will have available for us in 2024. And although those will be at margins better than what we saw  than what we saw kind of 18 months, 24 months, 36 months ago, and those are still lower than our aftermarket more run rate work. And secondarily, on the FCD slide, that backlog is actually right now skewed more towards project work or OE work than aftermarket. That backlog is about 300 basis points more OE this year at this time than it was last year. So, thats the other piece of project mix that we are looking at.Joe Giordano: Hey. On LNG, obviously, a lot going on with what the President has been saying about LNG export and things like that. Is that globally fungible to you guys? Like do you care where terminals are built? Like if we do less here, or is it just going to have to be somewhere else and you will be there?Scott Rowe: Yes. I would say our LNG work is more outside of the U.S. than in the U.S. And so we have got substantial bookings and opportunities in the Middle East. We have got some work on the books for Latin America, Africa. We have got a round two in Canada that we expect. And so I think we still feel good about the outlook of LNG. I wont get into the politics of this, but we think natural gas is an incredible transition source of energy, and we believe its going to be a part of the mix for a long time to come. I think the U.S. exporting permit hold will potentially have an impact on our kind of 2025 business, but 2024 work in the U.S. has already been funded and already been approved. And so it wont have an impact on what we see in 2024. And we will continue to migrate more of our products and services into cryogenic applications to support LNG because we are big believers in this over the next 10 years to 15 years.Joe Giordano: Just on that point on cryo, obviously, the land acquisition didnt work out. You bought technology  you bought R&D from Chart  like where are you with cryo kind of pumping applications? Is there more you need to do maybe an update there? And kind of related to that is, on your 3D, is there like fundamentally  are margins basically the same there as in more established markets for you guys now, or is that a gap you still need to be closed? Thanks.Scott Rowe: Yes. I will answer that one first because its easy. The 3D and certainly, the energy transition margin expectations are basically in line with the rest of the portfolio. And then back to cryogenic applications, I would say the bow portfolio is more rounded out than the pumps at this point. And so we have got control valves. We have isolation valves that can all do cryogenic, both LNG and hydrogen. There are opportunities, though, to grow that pretty substantially. And what we liked about Velan is they were better positioned with some of their technology and products than we were. And so continued M&A work on expanding that cryogenic portfolio in valves will continue to happen in 2024 and beyond. And then on the pumps side, we have got kind of two things. The acquisition that we did with Chart was really around hydrogen distribution, but we can take that technology and know-how and imply it into LNG and cryogenic applications. And so we are in the very late stages of developing a full cryogenic pump offering. And that, what we really like about that is it can be used for liquefaction transportation and into the re-gas application. And so by the  certainly, by kind of mid-year, late year, we will have a full kind of cryogenic pumping solution that will serve  that can be potentially used in  what we used in LNG but potentially used in hydrogen as well.Deane Dray: I would like to circle back on the comments regarding the mix of bookings this quarter, really interesting that no big orders, which kind of gives you a strong sense of the underlying demand that you are seeing, but I would love to hear some commentary. You called out both some project delays as well as selectivity. Can you just kind of give us directionally how much of an impact were the delays versus selectivity. And then maybe just  I dont know if there is any other factors that would have kept the larger orders to a minimum this quarter, but just size for us, the impact of it.Scott Rowe: Yes. So, in Q4, we had visibility to, lets call it, two or three awards, more on the pump side than the valve side, that did get delayed. And some of that was delayed into Q1 and some of it is going to be delayed probably the back half of the year. And as you know, you followed our business a long time. There is lots of reasons for delays. Project timing is incredibly hard to predict. But what I would say is those opportunities did not get canceled. They didnt get turned off. They might be slightly smaller, a little bit different than what we anticipated, but we are confident that they go forward in 2024. We are also confident given the selectivity that those will deliver the margins that we deserve as we go forward. And then I would just say on the selectivity side and turning things off, I think that was a trend predominantly throughout the whole year. There wasnt something major that we kind of missed out on in Q4. Its more about just putting the right resources upfront and doing the work thats required to prepare for these large tenders. And so when something comes out, its we are pulling the entire team. There is usually anywhere from 10 to 30 people that are working on these. And we have just been really selective at the front end and directing our resources to things that we think make more sense economically and can support that customer through the life cycle of their asset. So, I would say the Q4 was probably more a little bit of slip out than being selective, but again, we feel really good about what we are seeing in 2024 on the projects.Deane Dray: Thats great color. And just whats the balancing act that you have to do when the higher you ratchet up selectivity, then the downside is you missed kind of building the installed base and your ability to capture aftermarket. And look, the winners curse on these bigger deals is that there is margin pressure. So, there is a balancing act, but maybe you can just share with us some of the mechanics.Scott Rowe: It is a delicate balancing act Deane. And I will just say, between Amy and myself and Lamar Duhon, leads our Pumps division, thats probably the single biggest topic that we have with him and his team. And its not easy because we do know when you get the installed base, its pulling our seal business through, its pulling parts through, its pulling service through. And so we are actively pursuing installed base. At the same time, we are now modeling that out and looking at it on a returns basis. And so we can more accurately predict, like is that customer going to give us the aftermarket, or do they go out and bid some of that aftermarket. And so we can kind of model in what that probability of success looks like on the aftermarket and make much better decisions about where we will populate the installed base and where we wont. And so I would say we have improved dramatically in the last year about what we should pursue and where we shouldnt, but continuing to have a robust installed base and continuing to drive aftermarket support is important. And then the other thing I would say is we are also now with our aftermarket franchise and some of our business processes there that continue to improve on speed in winning, we are starting to win aftermarket work for third-party equipment. And so thats something we steered away from probably 4 years or 5 years ago. We are not openly going out and targeting our competitive aftermarket. But with our presence there, with our ability to drive speed and serve our customers in a timely manner, we are starting to see more and more work on stuff thats not necessarily our original equipment.Amy Schwetz: And I might just put an exclamation point on that from a portfolio perspective because we have committed to the long-term targets in terms of both revenue growth and margin expansion. And what we are trying to do is expand our installed base within the constraints as those  as that margin expansion and volume growth paradigm. So, I think as Scott pointed out, we are in a better position than we have ever been to do that. But as you can imagine, as a finance person, I absolutely love the aftermarket capture rate strategy and trying to be more aggressive about going after that higher margin business.Deane Dray: Alright. I appreciate all that insight. And just one other question, and its for Amy, thats really impressive free cash flow this quarter. Just where do you stand now on the whole releasing of buffer inventory? You gave lots of specifics about how much of each of the components of working capital improved, I would be interested in hearing a bit more about what we are seeing on these releases of buffer inventory now with the supply chain is normalizing. So, how much more do you have to go there? Thanks.Amy Schwetz: Yes. So, I will start. I think that 2024 from a working capital perspective was a journey. We saw collections throughout 2024 or 2023, excuse me, be quite strong. We were pleased with the way the organization collaborated with that to make sure that we got those where we wanted them to be. And really, the third quarter and the fourth quarter we had an opportunity to set ourselves up for inventory reduction by the end of the year, and that was partially sales volume, partially our planning processes getting better. If I were to put this in baseball terms, I think we are still in the, call it, the fourth innings of inventory reduction. I think we can continue to get smarter with that and our improvement of planning processes is really playing a key role in that. I think we are going to continue to make progress on that within 2024, but we have made it clear to the organization that we have also committed to growth. And so we have to be very smart about how we reduce that inventory over time and where and how we do that. So, I feel like we are striking the right balance, but we are going to march methodically towards that 25% to 27% working capital target.Unidentified Analyst: Hi there. Well, this is James on for Saree. Thanks for taking questions. So, I just wanted to kind of go back on the margins in the backlogs. So, I think you said the margins are coming at higher levels. But I think you said the orders are still not at the 2019 margin levels. So, where does that stand now? And what is the missing gap here since the demand seems strong. Thank you.Amy Schwetz: Yes. So, I would probably stop short of saying that we are not at 2019 margin levels yet in backlog. I think along the way, we are making progress from an operational excellence standpoint. We are working smarter at our facilities. And frankly, we are playing in different markets than we did in 2019 as we look at the growth of those 3D and energy transition markets. So, I certainly think that the margins in backlog today are a tailwind for us going into 2024. But we are going to continue to do the things that we need to do to improve that as we convert backlog into revenue. And thats really around making the most of these structural cost savings that we have in place and embedding operational excellence into each and every one of our facilities and processes. And then really ramping up our activities with respect to product management and using that as a lever, I think that becomes a lever more in the back half of 2024 than it is in the front half, but I expect that to be an area that we continue to progress and build momentum as we make our way through the year.Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks for the color. And I kind of wanted to ask on the FCD. I think the margins here expanded nicely and kind of reached the long-term target of the segment. So, can you kind of talk about the drivers here, kind of add more color here? And how should we think about the margin for FCD going into 2024? Thank you.Amy Schwetz: Yes. FCD has been a great story from a margin expansion standpoint in 2023. And how they ended the year was actually right in line with what our expectations were for them in 2023. I think as we move into 2024, we will see that moderate a bit with volume in the first quarter of the year and continue to make their way up sequentially again. The real headwind that FCD is going to have in 2024 is around mix. And in that they are now more focused in their backlog towards project versus aftermarket. There is about a 300 basis point shift there in terms of the makeup of backlog. So, that aftermarket strength we talk about in mix is really occurring on the FPD side. So, I would imagine that initially during 2024, we will see that margin expansion more on the FPD side than on FCD.Scott Rowe: Yes. And I would just add overall on margins. We had communicated earlier in the year that we were striving to get to 30% gross margins for the portfolio. We did that a little bit earlier than we expected. And so we feel really good about that margin trajection as we go forward. And as Amy said, its going to come more on the pumps side in 2024 than on the FCD side, but we still see nice progression forward and very much on the trajectory alignment towards our 2027 goals.We encourage you to use comments to engage with other users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other.

safe,Kenya targets to begin the construction of its first nuclear power plant in 2027. This is even as the country seeks to further diversify its energy generation amid rising demand and push for zero-carbon energy.It is now emerging that the country is ready to fully adopt nuclear applications as it gears up to operationalise its first nuclear power plant by 2035. A site has already been identified along the Coastal belt and feasibility studies are underway.At the recently concluded COP28, Nuclear Regulatory Authority (KNRA) officials said that with robust regulation, capacity building and borrowing of best practices from partners like the International Atomic Energy Agency and the US Nuclear Energy Commission, Kenya was all set to go nuclear.KNRA Director for Partnerships and Public Awareness Edward Mayaka noted the commitments given by governments, industry, civil organisations, and other stakeholders, saying contrary to popular opinion, nuclear is a safe bet in environmental protection.Nuclear energy offers several advantages in the context of addressing climate change. Unlike fossil fuels, nuclear power plants generate electricity through a process that produces virtually no direct carbon emissions. This characteristic alone makes nuclear energy an attractive option for countries striving to reduce their carbon footprint, said Mr Mayaka.Besides KNRAs regulatory role of protecting lives and the environment from harmful effects of nuclear and radiation, the authority hosts the chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear risk mitigation center at its national laboratory in Oloolua, Kajiado County, serving eastern Africa.In the past, three nuclear accidents have influenced the discontinuation of nuclear power: the 1979 Three Mile Island partial nuclear meltdown in the United States, the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Russia, and the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan.Due to these incidences, several countries have initiated a nuclear power phase-out, citing safety concerns. But in recent times, several countries formerly opposed to opening nuclear programmes or planning phase-outs have reversed course due to climate concerns and energy independence.As of 2021, Japan planned to restart 30 reactors by 2030. Also, according to research, the impacts of the nuclear shut-downs on the power generation mix have significantly set back emissions reduction goals in these countries.A recent study of the impacts of the German and Japanese phase-outs concludes that by continuing to operate their nuclear plants, "these two countries could have prevented 28,000 air pollution-induced deaths and 2,400 Metric tonnesof CO2 emissions between 2011 and 2017.Theres renewed interest in nuclear. We recently launched a postgraduate course in nuclear and radiation safety, which will go a long way in building Kenyas and Africas capacity to go nuclear, he said.The KNRA officials urged nuclear skeptics to embrace it, saying nuclear power plants have a cost advantage besides a remarkable track record of reliability and stability. They provide a steady source of electricity, which can be critical for countries looking to build resilient energy infrastructures capable of withstanding impacts of climate change, he said.According to the International Energy Agency, the global renewable energy supply from solar, wind, hydro, geothermal and ocean rose last year by eight per cent, meaning that the share of these technologies in total global energy supply rose by 0.4 per cent points to 5.5 per cent. Most countries, especially in the Global South, rely on hydroelectric power without diversifying electricity sources.
safe,Ive never been a Reddit user myself, but Im at least familiar with famous subreddits like r/Showerthoughts, where users have mini epiphanies or ask other netizens questions theyve been pondering about. Recently, Ive had a recurring shower thought of my own: why dont things that are alive, like the human body, go bad? We refrigerate food to keep it safe to eat, and we cook it to a temperature that kills germs. But our bodies, and those of most animals and plants living around the world, are definitely in the infamous food safety Danger Zone: 40140 degrees Fahrenheit. And animals like humans are full of almost comically high levels of many kinds of bacteria. Whats stopping us from becoming toxic, like cookie dough left at room temperature?I know what youre thinking. The bodys natural processes arent what would cause it to go bad or not, like old leftovers in the fridge. But these processes do remove the material chemical waste products made by bodily visitors like bacteria, as well as living and dead viruses and other disease-causing invaders. In a typical healthy persons body, everything that leaves the body must do so through one of these natural pathways, so they necessarily play a role.And to kill those germs in the first place, we have the immune system. As an example, a respiratory virus is repelled in multiple stages. The typical flu virus is 100+ times larger than an atom, while bacteria are ten times larger still. Our mouths and noses allow us to breathe in what we wanttiny oxygen molecules and other similarly sized particles that are part of regular airwhile physically obstructing some of the chunky bits like viruses, bacteria, and pollen. Then inside the body, the immune system finds, flags, and destroys invaders.That immune defense system is, it turns out, the bulk of the answer to my question. When we cook foods to a safe temperature, or keep them refrigerated, were building a defense system using temperature as a barrier: fewer germs can find and settle in food that is at one temperature extreme or the other. And in the body, where those temperature barriers are not an option if we want to keep being alive, our germs are fought off in realtime by roaming cells and coordinated mechanisms like inflammation. Inflammation opens a superhighway for immune cells to speed in and start picking off germs one by one.And while the immune system may be the most directly responsible defense, it cant work by itself. Everything else, from our electrolyte balance to the mitochondria, plays a part in supporting the entire body so that the immune cells can work effectively. One frightening example of this is necrosis, which is when body tissues die. For people with diabetes, which can inflame and restrict blood vessels and cause circulatory problems, theres often a higher risk of necrosis.But why do cells need blood flow in the first place? How does the flow of blood keep our tissues alive, and the restriction of blood cause them to wither? This goes back to the mitochondria. Body cells need oxygen in order to produce the energy used by the mitochondria, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This is called cellular respiration, and while Ive focused on the human body in this piece, animals as well as plants rely on cellular respiration. In this chemical reaction, cells take oxygen molecules and break them up to use them in other configurations. Blood also brings fresh fluid that can replenish tissue dehydration can cause cells to die.In asking myself how the human body doesnt go bad, I was engaging in some flawed high-level thinking, because the body is not homogeneous. We think of the body and the self in terms of one discrete person at a time, but the coordinated actions of trillions of cells, and the trillions of good bacteria that live in symbiosis with the human body, are constantly peeling the fingertips of invasive germs and disease off the ramparts. The reason living things dont go bad is that theyre filled to the brim with defenses. We continue to live by staving off the mechanisms of death.Caroline Delbert is a writer, avid reader, and contributing editor at Pop Mech. She's also an enthusiast of just about everything.

safe,A new tech ideology is ascendant online. Introducing effective accelerationism, the pseudonymous user Beff Jezos tweeted, rather grandly, in May 2022. E/acc  pronounced ee-ack  is a direct product [of the] tech Twitter schizosphere, he wrote. We hope you join us in this new endeavour.The reaction from Jezoss peers was a mix of positive, critical, and perplexed. What the f*** is e/acc, posted multiple users. Accelerationism is unfortunately now just a buzzword, sighed political scientist Samo Burja, referring to a related concept popularized around 2017. I guess unavoidable for Twitter subcultures? These [people] are absolutely bonkers, grumbled Timnit Gebru, an artificial intelligence researcher and activist who frequently criticizes the tech industry. Their fanaticism + god complex is exhausting.Despite the criticism, e/acc persists, and is growing, in the tech hive mind. E/accs founders believe that the tech world has become captive to a monoculture. If it becomes paralyzed by a fear of the future, it will never produce meaningful benefits. Instead, e/acc encourages more ideas, more growth, more competition, more action. Whether youre building a family, a startup, a spaceship, a robot, or better energy policy, just build, writes one anonymous poster. Do something hard. Do it for everyone who comes next. Thats it. Existence will take care of the rest.Jezos admits that his initial announcement was a bit of a shitpost. And e/accs perceived lack of clarity  what, exactly, are they advocating for?  makes it tempting to dismiss it. Nevertheless, it has since caught the attention of a growing number of tech figures: venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, YCombinator president Garry Tan, Notion co-founder Chris Prucha, Intercom co-founder Ciaran Lee, and science investor and former U.S. state official Jim ONeill, some of whom add e/acc to their online display names and bios as a sign of solidarity.If e/acc isnt entirely sure yet what it is for, it does know what its against. One of its chief adversaries is AI safety, a field concerned with the risks of developing AI too quickly. Another, closely related, adversary is effective altruism, a utilitarian movement that aims to do the most good in the world. Even e/accs name is a jab against EA. Whereas AI safetyists follow the precautionary principle in their thinking about AI  emphasizing risk avoidance over action  effective accelerationists preach blazing forward into the unknown, arguing that we will only learn by doing.But these debates dont explain why e/acc became suddenly popular among a wider set of technologists, many of whom arent involved with artificial intelligence. E/accs significance lies in its counterbalancing force not just to AI safety, but to widespread public concerns about the risks posed by the tech industry at large. Effective accelerationists worry that these concerns have become so entrenched that they threaten to extinguish the light of tech itself.In March 2023, the Future of Life Institute published an open letter calling for artificial intelligence labs, such as OpenAI and Google AI, to immediately pause the development of technology more powerful than GPT-4 for at least six months. If such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, the letter stated, governments should step in and institute a moratorium. The letter also called for new systems of auditing, certification, monitoring, and regulation as AI develops.The letter was initially signed by over a thousand people, many of whom were not just concerned citizens but AI technologists themselves, including Yoshua Bengio, a pioneer of artificial intelligence research; Elon Musk, one of OpenAIs original co-founders (though he has not been involved since 2018); and Emad Mostaque, founder of Stability AI. Another statement, warning of the risk of extinction from AI, was published by the Center for AI Safety in May. It was signed by AI leaders at OpenAI, Anthropic, and DeepMind, as well as senior executives from Google and Microsoft.Artificial intelligence is a rare domain where technologists themselves are being proactively cautious about their own power before any demonstrable harm has been done. The moral panic now comes from within  a stark deviation from how technological revolutions historically influence society, as scholar Carlota Perez documents in her seminal 2002 book Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital.Perez looked at major technological innovations in the industrial age  including steam and railway, steel and electricity, oil and automobiles, and digital communication  and noticed that they follow a pattern. There is the initial big bang event that signifies a major technical breakthrough, which goes largely unnoticed at the time. Technologists, however, recognize its potential and build upon this breakthrough for decades, until it attracts wider adoption and interest. Financial capital then takes over from technologists to continue driving its development, which creates a speculative public frenzy, a financial bubble, and collapse, followed by a period of reflection and reconciliation as the technology is finally stabilized and absorbed into our social norms.While Perez suggests that this cycle occurs roughly every fifty years, if we squint a bit, we can see it play out with several more-recent technological breakthroughs, such as cloud computing and smartphones  which together drove the Web 2.0 startup boom  and cryptocurrency. In each case, technologists are generally advocates, not detractors, of the opportunities they see before the rest of the world catches on.Even when financial capital is not so involved, technologists have historically been fiercely protective of their right to build and distribute their work. Open-source programmers in the late 1990s and early 2000s were adamant that we should not restrict how their free and public code could be used, nor hold programmers liable for users decisions. Cryptographic code was once considered a form of munitions in the United States, subject to tightly controlled export laws; it was technologists who advocated for the right to share this code across national borders. When it comes to artificial intelligence, on the other hand, some technologists are skipping ahead to reflecting on its harms before the impact is clear.Its not that tech has never had a community concerned about the risks and ethics of artificial intelligence; they just werent the ones driving its development. AI safety has been a cottage research field for decades, championed by rationalists  an Internet community that prioritizes logical thought and eliminating cognitive bias  and effective altruists. The Machine Intelligence Research Institute, co-founded by AI researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky, began focusing on these risks in 2005. Overcoming Bias, a blog started by Yudkowsky and economist Robin Hanson the following year, was the predecessor to the forum LessWrong, which became a watering hole for people concerned about AIs impact on society.Such efforts were widely recognized and even supported by those in tech, but seemingly more from a place of symbolic goodwill  the way a prominent financier might support the arts  than serious engagement. AI safety research, and its underlying rationalist community, was a comforting reminder to wealthy entrepreneurs that tech was not just a shallow way to make money through startups, but a thoughtful, intellectual place with its own philosophical culture.Since late 2022, however, when the explosive success of OpenAIs ChatGPT made the potential of artificial intelligence suddenly visible to the public, what was once a niche subculture became an unlikely public face of the controversy over AI development. Parties previously unaffiliated with the AI safetyists suddenly became their bedfellows, such as Tristan Harris, a former Google employee and self-described tech ethicist who had made a name for himself by raising concerns about the harms of social media. These cautionary positions have now spread to a wider set of startup founders and engineers.For OpenAI and other large corporate labs, this position may be partly strategic: some onlookers grumble that these labs are working to achieve regulatory capture, courting favor with government. If nothing else, their leaders have likely learned from the wave of backlash against social media executives that its better to preemptively establish relationships with policymakers than to be brash. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, testified before the Senate last spring that we want to work with the government to prevent [problems] from happening.Among a wider set of technologists, the appeal of AI safety might reflect a cognitive tendency to overly formalize social problems. AIs risks are especially frightening for those who find comfort in predicting human behavior with math rather than lived experience. Calculating these risks and designing theoretical governance structures to avoid them is itself a form of nerd sniping, visible in other places among the likes of rationalists and crypto-governance enthusiasts.Or, perhaps, wanting to be regulated is a subconscious way for tech to reassure itself about its central importance in the world, which distracts from an otherwise uneasy lull in the industry. AI is the crown jewel of the tech industry at a time when the golden age of software startups has passed. Venture capital funding crashed from its frothy peak in 2022, marking a new and grueling era for startup founders. AI is a critical morale boost to rally techs spirits; being important enough to warrant regulatory action means its relevance wont fade anytime soon.Regardless of motivations, its this anomalous behavior of tech leaders to worry about their own work that effective accelerationists are reacting to. They find it strange and disheartening to see their fellow technologists so timid and docile in the face of a major new development.Instead, e/accs exhort their peers to pluck up and find the courage to embrace unfamiliar territory  a stance that is often interpreted by others as reckless. Grimes, the futuristic-chic musician who also traverses tech circles, cautioned e/accs founders to be more thoughtful about how they express themselves. You are freaking people out, she stated in a Twitter Space discussion last March. [Its] causing people to panic at non-profits and agitate for government regulation. I think thats the kind of thing you need to be careful about and mindful of. Powerful people are watching this.While effective accelerationists can be juvenile, letting their love of memes overshadow their substance, its founders, in their serious moments, dont advocate for willful ignorance of risks. Both Beff Jezos and Bayeslord, another pseudonymous founder, have repeatedly stated that they support efforts to align AI with human welfare  they just dont want fear to be the primary guide of technological innovation. From now on I dont want to see a single tweet about how e/acc doesnt want people to work on alignment, Bayeslord declared. On the contrary, we think reliability engineering is valuable work. However, we also want the apocalyptoids and the power hungry to lose.Effective accelerationists dont want us all to stop caring. Just the opposite: they wish that everyone cared more. They dont want to be known for bleating platitudes about a better future, then airily waving away the details. Rather, their moral vision is one where more people  including and especially those who consider themselves hands-off today  actively engage with emerging technology and identify concrete plans for its development and stewardship, rather than reflexively backing away from what they dont understand. Discussing the risks and opportunities in front of us intelligently, e/accs believe, is a sign of a flourishing civil society.E/accs nemesis is not the political left, with its proclivity toward regulation. One Twitter poll asking effective accelerationists how they self-identified politically  an informal poll, but perhaps a meaningful one, given how close-knit and online the movement is so far  was split roughly evenly between left and right. The previous culture war was between left and right, Jezos says. Now acceleration is the only option, degrowth is death.Rather than use well-trod political labels, e/acc wants to be the alternative to what they call decels, for decelerationists: proponents of a passive, overly cautious approach to the future. Back when disruption was a buzzword, tech was united against this timid mindset, which it saw as the default outsider position, of those trapped in their miserable 9-to-5 cubicle jobs who could only think in terms of red tape and bureaucracy. As effective accelerationists see it, in recent years the decel attitude has crept into tech itself, and nowhere more clearly than in debates about artificial intelligence.If decels had a face in tech, it would be Big Tech employees, the defanged, corporatized version of the hackers and outcasts who once inspired the tech industry, now imprisoned on motivational posters aimed at self-loathing managers. This, perhaps, is something that e/accs and some tech critics can agree upon: Settling for a middling Big Tech job  chasing lavish promotions instead of making history  represents a failure to realize the promises of tech and what it sought to accomplish, which those on the frontier now want to recapture.It was the tech backlash of the 2010s that tore a hole through techs image as it previously saw itself: a burgeoning industry composed of startups and their financiers, whose members would grind away writing code on their MacBooks and attending YCombinators demo days, whose hardest decision every year was whether to go to Burning Man. Though a founders life was filled with highs and lows, the cycle of tech seemed stable and predictable. Most importantly, tech was beloved by the outside world, who gleefully consumed stories of young founders and their mythical overnight successes.What went wrong? While tech believed it was changing the world for the better, PayPal co-founder and venture capitalist Peter Thiel warned in his 2014 book Zero to One that this era was marked by indefinite optimism. In contrast to the definite optimist, who not only articulates a vision for the future but plans and works to make it better, the indefinite optimist believes the future will be better, but he doesnt know how exactly. He expects to profit from the future but sees no reason to design it concretely.Published at the height of techs infatuation with startup disruption, Thiels comments proved to be several steps ahead of the rest of the tech industry. While Thiel generally approved of startups as a vehicle for definite optimists to realize their goals, he criticized the incrementalist attitude that he saw creeping into Silicon Valley. Founders from this era busily copied the methodology from Eric Riess 2011 book The Lean Startup that emphasized iterating upon customer feedback to find the right fit between product and market. They adopted YCombinators Make something people want motto as canon, and pitched their companies to investors within the familiar framework of Im building X for Y: eBay for space (Airbnb), Uber for trucking (Convoy) and so on. Thiel was skeptical of this trend. He challenged founders to build solutions based on what they wanted to happen, rather than hamfistedly plastering a layer of software onto every problem in sight.Silicon Valleys indefinite optimism was equally foreshadowed by Marc Andreessens 2011 article Why Software Is Eating the World. While the phrase is remembered as a prediction of how founders from this era would become enormously wealthy, it also captures how their success was due to riding the wave of digitization, rather than leading with definite optimism. Techs love of digital disruption became a running joke: whether health care, local business, or agriculture, it seemed every outmoded industry could be magically transformed by the pixie dust of software. The subsequent graveyard of startups from this period reveals a lack of understanding by founders of how these industries actually worked, and of the complex social and political forces that shape them.Beyond startups, techs sunny navet extended to its relationship to society, creating resentment. There was the story of Patrick McConlogue, a software programmer living in New York, who attracted ire in 2013 when he published a Medium post explaining that he had offered Leo, a homeless man, a choice between either $100 in cash or three JavaScript books and a laptop, as well as an hour of McConlogues time every day to teach him how to code. Leo chose the latter, and McConlogue kept his promise and taught him how to code. They even built a ridesharing app together. But two years later, Leo was still homeless, overwhelmed by the attention hed received, and no longer coding. Though McConlogues attempts were earnest, he had applied a one-size-fits-all solution and hoped for the best. When he did not succeed, there was no backup plan.It was techs indefinite optimism that prevented it from heeding the signs of discontent swirling about, clinging to the industry like San Franciscos fog. There were the rising rents; the commuter protests; the murmurs about how techs biggest accomplishments were creating a crisis of attention, loneliness, and political strife  all easily dismissed by tech workers, whose experience had taught them that even against long odds they could only ever win, until they hit a snag in the fall of 2016.The outcome of the U.S. presidential election not only shocked legislators, who set about searching for answers from tech companies they believed were partly to blame for Donald Trumps victory; it also marked the turnover of the Obama administration, which had enthusiastically supported techs optimism. The world had called techs bluff, and it turned out that behind the cheerful promises of a better future there was no real vision that would assuage the betrayal that many felt.Those in tech burrowed underground to lick their wounds. As the smoke cleared, they began having private conversations with trusted peers and friends. They struggled to reconcile the sudden surge of anger from outsiders with their own internal sense of self. Over the next few years, tech experienced a profound loss of identity, followed by a search for meaning.Founders and engineers are not typically known for their innate interest in non-technical topics like philosophy and history, but they turned now to these pursuits to make sense of their predicament. Snapchat founder and CEO Evan Spiegel, who had previously made headlines for a series of boorish emails he had sent as an undergraduate to his Stanford fraternity brothers, now stood in front of the French-American Foundation in 2017 and spoke about Alexis de Tocqueville, who, as Spiegel put it, believed that the newspaper was one of the most important tools for helping democracy overcome individualism.Ultimately, everyone in tech was trying to answer the same question, posed for millennia by those unlucky souls who find themselves suddenly in exile: How, now, shall we live? If the brash, unchecked ambition that had defined tech for decades was no longer something to be proud of, how should technologists find meaning in their work today?The varying answers to this question scattered tech workers into different factions. Many were alarmed and remorseful about the harm they had caused  to Americas social fabric, teenage mental health, and the future of the country. They now faced difficult questions from friends and family about the transgressions of their employers, and resolved to shepherd what they saw as a more responsible approach to technology, examining the effects of misinformation, algorithmic bias, and lack of content moderation. Tristan Harris, the ex-Google tech ethicist, became a vocal advocate for addressing the negative effects of social media, featuring prominently in the 2020 Netflix documentary The Social Dilemma.Others blamed the American managerial class, whose appendages were tangled in a secular monoculture that had lost its moral and spiritual purpose. They found solace in the philosophical writings of Nick Land and a pseudonymous blogger named Mencius Moldbug, who expounded upon the idea that progressive liberal democracy is becoming an all-powerful bureaucratic oligarchy, the solution to which is a return to monarchy and traditional values. This was the beginning of the neoreactionary movement, which grew into the New Right today, and whose members, and associated figures in tech like Peter Thiel, backed anti-establishment candidates like J.D.Vance and Blake Masters in the 2022 elections.Still others felt that the problem was that America no longer valued technological progress and innovation. They read economist Tyler Cowens 2011 book The Great Stagnation, which warned that the American economy had begun to plateau. In 2019, Cowen and Stripe co-founder Patrick Collison published an Atlantic article titled We Need a New Science of Progress, by which they meant a study of the combination of economic, technological, scientific, cultural, and organizational advancement that has transformed our lives and raised standards of living over the past couple of centuries. Their efforts fostered a movement, sometimes called progress studies or just progress, as well as its cousin movement abundance, whose proponents focus on removing institutional roadblocks to innovation  particularly through an economic and policy lens  such as the development of clean energy, building more housing and public works, and funding scientific research.Others saw poor governance of San Francisco  which had attracted media attention for its crime, dirtiness, and political infighting  as a sign of how tech had underutilized its influence, falling out of step with its environment. The San Francisco School Board and district attorney elections became hotly contested battles as tech workers organized to support candidates who aligned with their values. Garry Tan, the YCombinator president who grew up in a working-class Bay Area immigrant family, devoted himself to improving San Franciscos living conditions, organizing recall campaigns, and supporting the launch of GrowSF, a political action committee founded by tech workers that focuses on reducing homelessness and improving public safety and services.While each of these tribes has a different underlying philosophy and agenda, they are united by an embrace of definite, rather than indefinite, approaches. Instead of the incrementalist, software eating the world approach to disruption, these tech tribes are now focused on bringing about tangible, meaningful change. They also tend to have greater humility toward what they realize they dont know. They are more likely to consult and build relationships with subject matter experts, policymakers, and researchers to inform their understanding of industries beyond their own. They are no longer afraid to get their hands dirty learning about climate science or housing materials, or approaching politicians, in order to achieve their goals.For example, in techs indefinite era, Googles parent company Alphabet launched Sidewalk Labs as an urban innovation company, which touted a project in Toronto featuring buzzy smart-city technology including sensors and touchscreens to help residents visualize energy usage and traffic patterns. The project never materialized. In todays definite era, wealthy tech patrons want to back San Franciscos GrowSF, which prioritizes outcomes over ideologies and whose plans for the city read more like a sensible agenda than a sci-fi novel: build homeless shelters, construct subway tunnels and bike lanes, and elect politicians who can get it all done.Another example of the shift  or the need for it  can be seen in the work of Jennifer Pahlka. Serving as U.S. Deputy Chief Technology Officer in the Obama administration, founder of Code for America, and creator of the United States Digital Service, Pahlka was one of the most visible faces of techs relationship to government in the 2010s. Code for America connects software engineers and designers with city governments to build web applications; the United States Digital Service is a government tech unit that consults federal agencies on how to improve their digital services, founded partly as a response to the disastrous technical rollout of Healthcare.gov in 2013.But digital tech alone was never a solution. In her 2023 book, Recoding America: Why Government Is Failing in the Digital Age and How We Can Do Better, Pahlka argues that people in government chronically undervalue the challenge of implementation of new digital projects, simply outsourcing them to software contractors and expecting that they mindlessly follow orders, rather than take part in the design process itself. Although government must adapt to an increasingly digital world, Pahlka writes, the heart of the adaptation isnt mobile apps, cloud computing, or even artificial intelligence. Instead, we have to examine and challenge the underlying structures, assumptions, and values that drive the larger system of government in which the bureaucracy of implementation operates.There was a time when indefinite optimists believed in disruption and move fast and break things. Now definite optimists believe in progress and acceleration. In the abstract, the two sets of concepts seem indistinguishable from one another. The difference is in strategy and tactics, and it is a more grounded focus on building for the future that effective accelerationists preach.Definite optimists strive for concrete goals, but e/acc is not, at least in its current form, a prescriptive movement with an agenda. Instead, e/acc is best understood as a cultural mirror, or what Jezos calls a meta philosophy. It reflects a shift in sentiment across many subcultures of builders, all of whom think tech has more to offer the world than overfunded software startups filled with free snacks and ping pong tables.Jezos himself was, he says, a theoretical physicist with a graduate degree who joined a Big Tech company to work on machine learning. After three years, he quit, disgusted with the lifestyle. So much of what is broken with big tech is because it selects for pure status-seekers rather than builders, he tweeted. Jezos sold his car, moved back in with his parents to save money, and eventually took out a personal loan to start a company, buying $100,000 worth of GPUs and building an army of workstations in his home.It was while Jezos was working in Big Tech that he created a pseudonymous Twitter account and found others to talk to. In the early days of the Covid pandemic, confined to their homes, he and a handful of other accounts began having late-night discussions on Twitter Spaces  a voice-only conversation app  about where the world was going. Like Jezos, many of them also worked in Big Tech and were frustrated by the milquetoast ambitions of their organizations. And like Jezos, they tweeted as a way to vent, while using pseudonyms to avoid repercussions at work. (Against his will, Jezoss real identity was revealed by Forbes in December.) E/acc emerged from these conversations as a philosophy for builders to express how they feel about their role in society and what theyre contributing to civilization, and how they can feel happy with their day-to-day lives, Jezos explained in an interview on the Moment of Zen podcast. It was an antidote to the shame and embarrassment that lingered from the tech backlash, a way to take back the spirit of tech.E/acc was cooked up when some Big Tech engineers were very talented but crushed by top-down bureaucracy, Beff reminisced on a Twitter Space last March. On a subsequent Space, he added: Theres a pervasive mind virus in a lot of Big Tech organizations that causes a lot of engineers working on powerful tech to have self-hatred. Its not healthy at all. They kind of get depressed because the whole system tells them that they are bad. I was thinking, lets make an ideology where the engineers and builders are heroes.E/acc is a litmus test for whether someone is a corporate wagie, mindlessly collecting paychecks at a Big Tech company or overfunded startup, or whether the person believes that tech, at its best, is not merely another industry like finance or fashion but a safe haven for people from all backgrounds to build the future they envision, free from cynical naysayers.Having descended down the other side of the backlash, tech is now preoccupied with solving problems in the physical world with a more sophisticated toolkit than before. There is an influx of founders starting deep tech companies, which tackle complex technical and scientific challenges in areas such as nuclear energy, aerospace, and biotech  all unthinkable in the previous era, when the mention of anything non-software sent investors running in the other direction. Whats more, the new founders now come from a different talent pool, bringing deep expertise from hard scientific and engineering backgrounds.And this activity isnt just restricted to startups anymore, either. Tech now understands the role that policy can play in helping  or hindering  them to build faster, across an array of issues. The Institute for Progress, a tech-minded D.C. policy think tank, is partnering with the National Science Foundation to design and test new ways to fund research and innovation. Founders working in and around artificial intelligence travel to D.C. to meet with policymakers, from Amjad Masad seeking to demonstrate the positive and pragmatic side of AI through his software-creation platform Replit, to Clem Delangue advocating for transparency, openness, and distribution of value and power with AI developer-tool company Hugging Face.We are also seeing techs ethos attract like-minded people from other sectors, even if they dont have backgrounds in startups. Ezra Klein of the New York Times and Derek Thompson of the Atlantic are two of the most prominent voices advocating for abundance. Dartmouth economics professor Heidi Williams leads the Institute for Progresss science policy efforts. Frontier, a $1billion initiative started by Stripe to kickstart the carbon removal market, relies upon a panel of advisors and technical reviewers from industry, research, and academia.The newest generation of technologists knows they wont derive long-term satisfaction from building a trivial product feature and selling it to a Big Tech company for a few hundred million dollars. They want to rekindle the torch of tech from before the glut and frivolity of the startup frenzy, the part thats still acceptable to memorialize in Hollywood biopics about Nikola Tesla and Alan Turing. And they realize now that accomplishing this will require them to expand their own skills and knowledge, instead of believing that software alone will save (or eat) the world.Not all of their efforts are associated with effective accelerationism itself, but they grew from the same psychological place that drove Beff Jezos and his peers to ruminate about the purpose of tech during the pandemic. There is a groundswell of excitement in tech, still rising, that feels like a palate cleanser to the doom and gloom of the post-backlash era. E/acc may not offer the roadmap that definite optimists need, but it signals a shift in tech culture that is long overdue.
risk,In an online video from Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation, a cartoon simulation shows a tsunami wiping out one of their future nuclear power stations and cutting off power. What happens next? Not much: The reactor quietly shuts itself down. It cools off just by sitting there, no moving parts or fluids, no operator actions, says the reassuring video. Weve designed a reactor that is inherently safe no matter the events.The Seattle-based Ultra Safe and dozens of other companies like it are at the forefront of a global nuclear energy revival. As the world urgently needs to wean itself off fossil fuels, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and get the planets temperature under control, policymakers, companies and researchers are reexamining nuclear energy as a green alternative that can help bolster the power produced by renewables like wind and solar. Today the industry is emerging from a period of stagnation, with a promise to double or triple its capacity by 2050.That revival is undergirded by two hot technology trends. Companies like Ultra Safe are aiming to build small modular reactors (SMRs) designed to be just a fraction of the size of former plants, to reduce both building costs and the scope of possible disasters. And many are aiming to utilize new technologies designed to make meltdown accidents impossible and to create less long-lived waste.But the surge in interest is not without controversy. As with everything in the nuclear landscape, debate rages about whether society actually needs nuclear to tackle climate change, and whether the new systems are as shiny as they seem  with reasonable arguments for and against every promise and risk. Some say the new technologies could offer a fantastic solution to our energy woes; others say nuclear is beset with so many environmental, social and economic problems that it is best abandoned in favor of other ways to meet the globes energy demands.The next few years will decide what course nuclear power takes in the worlds energy future. This is a moment of truth, says Francesca Giovannini, a nuclear policy expert at the Harvard Kennedy School. Over the next few decades, nuclear power is either going to make it, or that industry is fundamentally done for. ... Its 50/50 how this goes.Nuclear power poses some obvious risks  meltdown accidents, nuclear fuel being diverted to weapons programs, environmental issues posed by mining for uranium, the problems of storing nuclear waste. Against a backdrop of such concerns, alongside shifting economics of energy production, nuclear power production started to level off in the early 2000s and even dipped briefly after the Fukushima power plant accident of 2011. Some nations, most notably Germany, decided to shutter their nuclear programs entirely. But global nuclear power production is now starting to inch upward again.Today, nuclear plants produce about 10 percent of global electricity, making nuclear the second largest source of non-fossil-fuel energy after hydropower. There are about 440 nuclear power plants in operation globally; another 60 or so are now being built, and around 100 are on order or planned.Most Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios for keeping the world below 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming include some kind of increase in nuclear power capacity. In the International Energy Agencys (IEA) pathway to net zero, global nuclear power production doubles over 2022 levels by 2050. A key reason for this is that nuclear is seen as a good way to provide consistent baseload power to prop up more variable renewable sources of energy like wind or solar. Without nuclear, advocates say, we would need to build far more wind and solar power plants to ensure reliable supplies, doubling or tripling costs over power networks that include nuclear.Nuclear has plenty of advantages: It produces no carbon emissions (and, counterintuitively, releases less radioactive uranium and other elements into the environment than burning coal does). It takes up a lot less land than renewables, a not insignificant consideration. If the goal is to decarbonize quickly and with as little social pain as possible, nuclear is essential, says Kai Vetter, a nuclear physicist at the University of California, Berkeley.At the UNs Convention on Climate Change meeting in Dubai in December 2023, more than 20 nations signed a declaration to triple nuclear capacity by 2050. And cash is flowing into this effort. In 2020, the US Department of Energy (DOE) notably gave $160 million for two demonstration plants to get up and running by 2027. And in 2022, the European Union declared that some nuclear projects could call themselves green in the same way as renewables, opening the door to environmental financing mechanisms.But as with almost every issue relating to nuclear power, the arguments in favor of nuclear have their detractors. Public policy expert M.V. Ramana at the University of British Columbia is one of many, for example, who say that baseload power is an outdated concept. A smart, diverse and flexible electric grid, they argue, can assure a reliable power supply by shunting power among sources and storage facilities.Most scenarios for global net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 include a role for nuclear power. Here, projections from the International Energy Agency forecast that the total amount of power from nuclear will need to grow by 2050 to meet needs (left). But because the worlds total energy demand is expected to rise significantly, nuclears share of all power generation may actually fall (right).Then theres the question of safety. The grand total of lives lost from all nuclear power generation to date, while hard to quantify, is certainly far lower than the number of people killed by air pollution related to the burning of fossil fuels; a recent paper by NASA scientists concluded that nuclear power saved roughly 1.8 million lives from 1971 to 2009 thanks to avoided air pollution. By some accounts nuclear power has also proved less deadly than wind power, which has been linked to drownings at offshore wind farm sites and helicopter collisions with turbines.But fatality is arguably a blunt way to measure the impacts of the nuclear industry, which also include the risk of accidents contaminating large tracts of land, plus numerous other effects related to such things as mining and waste storage. Ramana has documented how the burden of these last issues falls disproportionately on Indigenous and disempowered communities, working against the goals of social justice. Nuclear power, he writes, does not fit with any idea of a responsible and cleaner energy system.If we are to pursue nuclear power at the scale called for by the IEA, it will take a herculean effort. The IEAs pathway requires the world to ramp up from building five big nuclear plants per year to 20 per year over the next decade. Big plants typically cost billions of dollars and come with big financial risks. Westinghouse Electric Company, for example, recently filed for bankruptcy in the face of billions of dollars of cost overruns during the construction of four nuclear plants in the United States.One plan for reducing those epic and prohibitive costs is to build small modular reactors, ranging from reactors that can be shipped on a truck and produce a couple of hundred megawatts, to tiny single-megawatt sizes that are more akin to hefty diesel generators. The modules could be pre-built in a factory and shipped to a site for installation. All this should make these reactors less frightening prospects for investors (though the end price per unit of electricity might wind up higher than that from a larger nuclear power plant).A handful of SMRs are already in operation in Russia, China and India. Dozens more are in development. Canada has a national SMR action plan, and as of 2021 there were 10 SMR proposals under review (including one from Ultra Safe).But so far, the promise of enticingly low costs for SMR builds hasnt materialized, says Granger Morgan, a physicist and codirector of the Center for Climate and Energy Decision Making at Carnegie Mellon. Morgan has crunched the numbers for nuclear in the US and was disappointed. I thought SMRs were going to hold much more promise, but we cant make the numbers wash, he says.That message was hammered home in November 2023 when the company NuScale scrapped its high-profile advanced plans to build an underground SMR in Idaho in the face of cost hikes. Would it be nice to have nuclear? Yes absolutely, says Morgan. Will it be affordable? Thats very much an open question.Others argue that small isnt always beautiful. While smaller plants present a smaller risk from smaller potential accidents, this strategy also means more plants overall, which means more facilities to protect against theft and terrorism. You have way more fissile material dispersed; you will have to secure way more infrastructure, says Giovannini. I mean, that becomes a mess.While some are focusing on making nuclear plants smaller, theres a parallel movement to make them safer and more efficient. The next generation of reactor designs  Generation IV, in the industrys lingo  includes a suite of six major reactor families, all very different from todays standard, each with many possible variants under development. Much of the attention (particularly in the US) has been focused on three of these: high-temperature gas-cooled, molten salt and sodium-cooled.The ideas behind these technologies, and even some early-stage power plants, have been around for decades. But the new variants of these old ideas combine novel fuels and designs, promising to be safer, more efficient and environmentally friendly. Theyre doing all kinds of whizz-bang, high-tech stuff, says Morgan, who has no doubt that newer reactors can be made safer than old ones.Most existing reactors are water-cooled uranium systems, which were chosen as the dominant technology largely as a quirk of history. Like all reactor types, they have their pros and cons. They need high pressures to stop their coolant waters from boiling off at typical operating temperatures around 300 degrees Celsius. And they are designed to work with relatively slow-moving neutrons  the subatomic particles that collide with nuclear fuel to initiate nuclear fission. Slow-moving neutrons are more likely to interact with fuel particles, but systems that use them are also limited in the kinds of fuels they can use. Catastrophe can strike if the fission reaction runs amok or the reactor gets too hot and the core melts down, as happened at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima, spewing radiation into the environment.Standard water-cooled reactor designs are vulnerable to catastrophic failures leading to explosions and the meltdown of the reactor core, as happened in 1986 to the Chernobyl reactor shown here. Newer designs may be less vulnerable to this type of unsafe meltdown, advocates say.The latest models of water-cooled reactors (sometimes called Gen III Plus, including many SMRs) use new design tricks to reduce the number of safety systems that require human intervention, aiming to stop accidents in their tracks automatically. Gen IV reactors, though, use entirely different coolant materials, are usually designed to operate at higher, more efficient temperatures, and often use faster-speed neutrons that can convert the most prevalent natural isotopes of uranium into usable fuel, or even feed on nuclear waste.High-temperature gas-cooled reactors, for example, run at temperatures up to 950C, making them 20 to 33 percent more thermally efficient than water-cooled reactors. Since the core materials used in these reactors are typically stable up to 1,600C, which is hotter than lava, theres a large margin of safety. The reactor in Ultra Safes video is an SMR that falls into this category; its small size helps, too, with passive cooling. Ultra Safe also makes their own fuel pellets, encased in a bespoke material that they say retains radioactive materials even in extreme conditions. Theyre hoping to build their first commercial micro-reactor in Canada.In molten salt reactors, both fuel and coolant are already liquid. So meltdowns, in the traditional sense, are impossible. And liquid-sodium-cooled reactors have a built-in safety feature: If they heat up, the liquid sodium expands and allows more neutrons to escape through the gaps between atoms, so the reaction (which is driven by neutrons) naturally winds down. The US Department of Energy has funded the US company TerraPower (which has Bill Gates as a major investor) to build a demonstration plant of its sodium-cooled Natrium reactor in Wyoming by 2030.Waste is one area where the new designs really see some significant improvements, says Giovannini. None of the reactors have entirely solved the problem of nuclear waste, but they do provide some significant solutions in terms of quantity, she says. The spent fuel from traditional light water reactors needs to be buried in special repositories for hundreds of thousands of years, because of the production of long-lived radioactive byproducts. Some Gen IV reactors, on the other hand, can transform spent fuel into more fissile isotopes and use it for further fission reactions. This can improve efficiency and produce waste that need only be stored for hundreds of years.Not everyone, though, thinks all these systems are as shiny as they seem. In 2021, the Union of Concerned Scientists published a report entitled Advanced Isnt Always Better, in which they highlighted issues with safety, sustainability and nuclear proliferation. They concluded that nearly all the Gen IV reactor types fail to provide significant enough improvements over [light water reactors] to justify their considerable risks.The report was criticized by some for being ideologically antinuclear, says Giovannini. But, she says, it was very fair to point out that new tech comes with new worries. Liquid salt, the report pointed out, is corrosive; liquid sodium metal can burst into flame when in contact with water or air. High-temperature gas-cooled reactors, the report concluded, while tolerant of high temperatures, are far from meltdown-proof, as some claim.Many of these Gen IV systems offer another key benefit: Their higher temperatures can provide not just electricity but also useful heat. This could be used in many industrial processes, such as the production of steel, cement and fertilizer, which currently burn a lot of fossil fuels in their furnaces.That heat is pretty much for free, says Vetter, who sees a particular utility for nuclear heat in desalination, getting clean drinking water out of saltwater as is done at the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant in California. Indeed, X-energy, a leading US Gen IV nuclear company funded by the DOE, has partnered with Dow chemical company to build its first high-temperature gas-cooled reactor at a Dow chemical production site by 2030. Morgan, though, thinks that most industries will balk at the set-up costs.Even if Gen IV reactors turn out to be technically superior, though, it may be decades before they can be thoroughly tested, passed by regulators and built at commercial scale. With little time to spare in the fight against climate change, the world might be better off simply ramping up old reactor designs that are already proven, says Esam Hussein, a retired nuclear engineer from the University of Regina, Canada. We have the operating experience, we have the regulatory framework, he says. If the goal is to fight climate change, why dont you go with the devil you know?In response to why we need a devil at all, many are quick to point out that no energy solution is problem-free, including renewables. Giovannini says she agrees with the nuclear industrys criticism that we have jumped on renewables in a very uncritical way. Wind and solar require electronics and battery banks to store their energy; these in turn need elements like lithium and cobalt that can come with environmental and social justice issues from mining. Nothing is 100 percent safe, says Vetter.It is hard for many to swallow data, assurances and statistics about nuclear, given its history and the huge amounts of money at stake. I think the nuclear industry is selling a bunch of bullshit most of the time, says Giovannini, who has been critical of how the industry deals with public concerns. But her own main worry about nuclear is theyre moving too slow. If companies like Ultra Safe, X-Energy, TerraPower and others are going to help fight climate change with Gen IV technologies and fleets of small reactors, she and others say, theyre going to have to ramp up fast.Editors note: This story was updated on March 20, 2024, to change a name: Granger Morgan was referred to as Granger instead of Morgan in one reference.

Please see our full guidelines for more information.In an online video from Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation, a cartoon simulation shows a tsunami wiping out one of their future nuclear power stations and cutting off power. What happens next? Not much: The reactor quietly shuts itself down. It cools off just by sitting there, no moving parts or fluids, no operator actions, says the reassuring video. Weve designed a reactor that is inherently safe no matter the events.The Seattle-based Ultra Safe and dozens of other companies like it are at the forefront of a global nuclear energy revival. As the world urgently needs to wean itself off fossil fuels, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and get the planets temperature under control, policymakers, companies and researchers are reexamining nuclear energy as a green alternative that can help bolster the power produced by renewables like wind and solar. Today the industry is emerging from a period of stagnation, with a promise to double or triple its capacity by 2050.That revival is undergirded by two hot technology trends. Companies like Ultra Safe are aiming to build small modular reactors (SMRs) designed to be just a fraction of the size of former plants, to reduce both building costs and the scope of possible disasters. And many are aiming to utilize new technologies designed to make meltdown accidents impossible and to create less long-lived waste.But the surge in interest is not without controversy. As with everything in the nuclear landscape, debate rages about whether society actually needs nuclear to tackle climate change, and whether the new systems are as shiny as they seem  with reasonable arguments for and against every promise and risk. Some say the new technologies could offer a fantastic solution to our energy woes; others say nuclear is beset with so many environmental, social and economic problems that it is best abandoned in favor of other ways to meet the globes energy demands.The next few years will decide what course nuclear power takes in the worlds energy future. This is a moment of truth, says Francesca Giovannini, a nuclear policy expert at the Harvard Kennedy School. Over the next few decades, nuclear power is either going to make it, or that industry is fundamentally done for. ... Its 50/50 how this goes.Nuclear power poses some obvious risks  meltdown accidents, nuclear fuel being diverted to weapons programs, environmental issues posed by mining for uranium, the problems of storing nuclear waste. Against a backdrop of such concerns, alongside shifting economics of energy production, nuclear power production started to level off in the early 2000s and even dipped briefly after the Fukushima power plant accident of 2011. Some nations, most notably Germany, decided to shutter their nuclear programs entirely. But global nuclear power production is now starting to inch upward again.Today, nuclear plants produce about 10 percent of global electricity, making nuclear the second largest source of non-fossil-fuel energy after hydropower. There are about 440 nuclear power plants in operation globally; another 60 or so are now being built, and around 100 are on order or planned.Most Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios for keeping the world below 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming include some kind of increase in nuclear power capacity. In the International Energy Agencys (IEA) pathway to net zero, global nuclear power production doubles over 2022 levels by 2050. A key reason for this is that nuclear is seen as a good way to provide consistent baseload power to prop up more variable renewable sources of energy like wind or solar. Without nuclear, advocates say, we would need to build far more wind and solar power plants to ensure reliable supplies, doubling or tripling costs over power networks that include nuclear.Nuclear has plenty of advantages: It produces no carbon emissions (and, counterintuitively, releases less radioactive uranium and other elements into the environment than burning coal does). It takes up a lot less land than renewables, a not insignificant consideration. If the goal is to decarbonize quickly and with as little social pain as possible, nuclear is essential, says Kai Vetter, a nuclear physicist at the University of California, Berkeley.At the UNs Convention on Climate Change meeting in Dubai in December 2023, more than 20 nations signed a declaration to triple nuclear capacity by 2050. And cash is flowing into this effort. In 2020, the US Department of Energy (DOE) notably gave $160 million for two demonstration plants to get up and running by 2027. And in 2022, the European Union declared that some nuclear projects could call themselves green in the same way as renewables, opening the door to environmental financing mechanisms.But as with almost every issue relating to nuclear power, the arguments in favor of nuclear have their detractors. Public policy expert M.V. Ramana at the University of British Columbia is one of many, for example, who say that baseload power is an outdated concept. A smart, diverse and flexible electric grid, they argue, can assure a reliable power supply by shunting power among sources and storage facilities.Then theres the question of safety. The grand total of lives lost from all nuclear power generation to date, while hard to quantify, is certainly far lower than the number of people killed by air pollution related to the burning of fossil fuels; a recent paper by NASA scientists concluded that nuclear power saved roughly 1.8 million lives from 1971 to 2009 thanks to avoided air pollution. By some accounts nuclear power has also proved less deadly than wind power, which has been linked to drownings at offshore wind farm sites and helicopter collisions with turbines.But fatality is arguably a blunt way to measure the impacts of the nuclear industry, which also include the risk of accidents contaminating large tracts of land, plus numerous other effects related to such things as mining and waste storage. Ramana has documented how the burden of these last issues falls disproportionately on Indigenous and disempowered communities, working against the goals of social justice. Nuclear power, he writes, does not fit with any idea of a responsible and cleaner energy system.If we are to pursue nuclear power at the scale called for by the IEA, it will take a herculean effort. The IEAs pathway requires the world to ramp up from building five big nuclear plants per year to 20 per year over the next decade. Big plants typically cost billions of dollars and come with big financial risks. Westinghouse Electric Company, for example, recently filed for bankruptcy in the face of billions of dollars of cost overruns during the construction of four nuclear plants in the United States.One plan for reducing those epic and prohibitive costs is to build small modular reactors, ranging from reactors that can be shipped on a truck and produce a couple of hundred megawatts, to tiny single-megawatt sizes that are more akin to hefty diesel generators. The modules could be pre-built in a factory and shipped to a site for installation. All this should make these reactors less frightening prospects for investors (though the end price per unit of electricity might wind up higher than that from a larger nuclear power plant).A handful of SMRs are already in operation in Russia, China and India. Dozens more are in development. Canada has a national SMR action plan, and as of 2021 there were 10 SMR proposals under review (including one from Ultra Safe).But so far, the promise of enticingly low costs for SMR builds hasnt materialized, says Granger Morgan, a physicist and codirector of the Center for Climate and Energy Decision Making at Carnegie Mellon. Morgan has crunched the numbers for nuclear in the US and was disappointed. I thought SMRs were going to hold much more promise, but we cant make the numbers wash, he says.That message was hammered home in November 2023 when the company NuScale scrapped its high-profile advanced plans to build an underground SMR in Idaho in the face of cost hikes. Would it be nice to have nuclear? Yes absolutely, says Morgan. Will it be affordable? Thats very much an open question.Others argue that small isnt always beautiful. While smaller plants present a smaller risk from smaller potential accidents, this strategy also means more plants overall, which means more facilities to protect against theft and terrorism. You have way more fissile material dispersed; you will have to secure way more infrastructure, says Giovannini. I mean, that becomes a mess.While some are focusing on making nuclear plants smaller, theres a parallel movement to make them safer and more efficient. The next generation of reactor designs  Generation IV, in the industrys lingo  includes a suite of six major reactor families, all very different from todays standard, each with many possible variants under development. Much of the attention (particularly in the US) has been focused on three of these: high-temperature gas-cooled, molten salt and sodium-cooled.The ideas behind these technologies, and even some early-stage power plants, have been around for decades. But the new variants of these old ideas combine novel fuels and designs, promising to be safer, more efficient and environmentally friendly.

risk,Notwithstanding justified concerns about aspiring nuclear powers such as Iran, it is worth remembering that there still are only nine countries with nuclear weapons, far less than the two dozen that John F. Kennedy predicted there would be by the 1970s. When nuclear non-proliferation is prioritized, it works.CAMBRIDGE  Preparations are already underway at the United Nations for the 2026 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which was originally signed in 1968. Many expect a contentious event. Some countries are having second thoughts about the principle of non-proliferation, because they wonder if Russia would have invaded Ukraine in 2022 if the latter had kept the nuclear weapons it inherited from the Soviet Union. Such counterfactuals, in turn, have renewed others fears of nuclear proliferation.These concerns are not new, of course. In my memoir, A Life in the American Century, I revisit an equally contentious period in the 1970s, when I was in charge of US President Jimmy Carters non-proliferation policy. Following the 1973 oil crisis, the conventional wisdom was that the world was running out of oil and needed to turn to nuclear energy. However, it was also widely  and wrongly  believed that the world was running out of uranium and therefore would have to rely instead on reprocessed plutonium (a byproduct of the uranium used in nuclear reactors).According to some forecasts at the time, as many as 46 countries would be reprocessing plutonium by 1990. The problem, of course, was that plutonium is a weapons-usable material. A world awash in the trade of plutonium would be at much greater risk of nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism.Please enter your email address and click on the reset-password button.

risk,The campaign is already appearing in more than 2,200 locations in city building lifts and lobbies in Sydney and Melbourne, and on animated digital billboards in airport lounges at Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne Airport.The campaign by the CEC follows an intense push by the federal Coalition, amplified and often widely supported in mainstream media, to bring a halt to the rollout of large scale renewables, and keep coal fired power stations open until some sort of nuclear option becomes available.The Coalitions chief advisors admit that nuclear, which apart from its extremely high costs, is inflexible and has poor ramping rates, to respond in changes of demand or supply, is effectively not comparable with a grid supplied larger by wind and solar, which needs fast and flexible capacity to support it.In effect, because the grid is morphing from a system built around centralised baseload principles to a more distributed system based around wind, solar and flexibility, the two technologies  nuclear and renewables  are effectively incompatible.I agree with the Clean Energy Council that the Australian opposition plan to build nuclear on decommissioned coal sites is not the best solution  though given 25+ years of failure to make renewables useful, their advocacy for more green energy is absurd.Nuclear might be affordable in the long run, but financing high up-front costs is not something financially stretched energy consumers could easily absorb. Building low cost brown coal plants or refurbishing old plants would be a much better strategy for lowering end user energy prices.Dont get me wrong, Im a fan of nuclear, and there are plenty of remote sites in Australia where nuclear would be the cheaper option. But ignoring our vast remaining reserves of brown coal does not make economic sense.Brown coal does not have value as a saleable commodity, because unlike black coal, brown coal cannot be transported economically. Brown coal has lower energy density than black coal, and when stored for transport has a distressing tendency to spontaneously combust. Brown coals only value comes from digging it up then immediately shovelling it into an adjacent coal power plant.Given the success of the first French nuclear program, which was able to proceed without lawfare by and by, Australia could copy that approach. South Korea seems to have a reasonable approach currently, and should be willing to sell advice.Or the Finns whove just paid the price for getting up to pace. What are the Greenies afraid of dropping the nuke ban if solar and wind plus dispatchability 24/7/365 with FCAS is cheapest? As if we didnt know deniers.Thanks, Eric.  It seems to me the only necessary government role in planning, permitting, constructing, operating, and monitoring nuclear energy plants is to keep frivolous lawsuits from interfering in the process.  Larger energy companies should be willing to fund the project, as long as the critical path to remunerative production is not artificially prolonged.  Sure, consumers would probably pay an enhanced fee in the payback years, but the price would settle down and the steady energy supply would be worth it.I agree nuclear is reliable and affordable, my complaint is in many cases for Australia brown coal would deliver lower prices. Australias manufacturing industry shrivelled since the 1950s because of energy prices, only by removing obstacles to the cheapest possible energy can we begin the road to recovery.Once Melbourne had car plants  for   majors Holden, Ford but also Nissan, Volkswagen Toyota ( when it was small), Renault. They built there own bulk carriers in SA  with some subsidy . The national airline  was supported with a policy of  having  50% of the  passengers on all routes. Many of the big mining companies  route  sales through low tax Singapore  so only leave Australia with the pittance of royalties ( made to look generous by the share volume.If the brown coal deposits are near the point of demand and the losses and costs of transmission dont overcome the savings of coal plants relative to nuclear, then it makes economic sense to exploit the coal reserves as you recommend.So, the greenies recognize that a zero carbon, everlasting energy supply is a threat to their intermittent, and NOT renewable energy scheme is a threat? Damn, I have to give them more credit than I have in the past. Sun is effective less than 12 hours a day, planet wide. It has to be at the proper angle in order to even work. You can only use it while the sun is shining effectively. Wind? It is either there or it is not.It is ENERGY INTENSIVE to make solar arrays and wind farms. They have a short lifetime, after which they cannot be recycled, but must be replaced, not to mention the ongoing maintenance to keep them running, and the death of wildlife as a result of them functioning.Somehow, they think there is no cost to digging the minerals needed to support these schemes, and they forget that their renewable energy is not used to build these monstrosities. It is the very energy source that they seek to replace that is required to build them. Lets see solar energy companies use only solar energy to make their panels and wind farm companies use only wind power to build and install them. If that becomes fact, I will start believing. I am not holding my breath, however.Number one whining that nuclear isnt flexible enough to backup wind and solar is absurd. A proper energy source doesnt require copious backup. Wind and solar does therefore it is not a suitable energy source.There is no need to make this more complicated. It is not complicated at all, we need a constant, reliable source of energy at a reasonable cost, it is as simple as that. Wind and solar arent constant, arent reliable and arent affordable.Australia has vast reserves of black and brown coal, natural gas and uranium ore and has been first second or third in global exports of all the above in recent years yet all the above are in some way restricted or banned from use locally.At present the country is on course for a big energy crunch and whichever party happens to be in power at the time will have to decide to lift whichever of those current restrictions on local use will get them in least trouble electorally.Yes.  The smaller reactors are perfect for Australian baseload  with its   wide apart population centres  like Perth Brisbane  etc and  the  15 mill in the SE  part of the country with an existing gridThe 8 February announcement detailed the intention to deploy four Westinghouse AP300 SMRs at the site, a technology previously selected by Great British Nuclear (GBN) in October. These are expected to be up and running by the 2030s, providing 1.5 GW of power, or enough to power up to two million homes.Tis Saturday so demand is a little lower than week days but all Australian regions have experienced negative wholesale price today.  All regions, apart from Tasmania, experienced economic offloading of WDGs.A coal power plant must run all the time because one cannot fire up a boiler and have it running on a now basis. The same for natural gas power stations unless they are the small on/off systems, jet engine style.The current mentality is that there must be subsidies for these wonderful renewables, one for building and another for running even when they dont produce anything. How much in subsidies the tax payer is paying for this renewable wonder thing is seldom if ever publicly available.My limited opinion is that many people, who are easily persuaded against nuclear, look at nuclear power as some form of stand by generation. Hence it is a very high cost. These same people do not know or if the know, what the subsidies to the renewable this is do not include that in the cost of renewables. Its not the VIBE.Brown coal exists mainly in Victoria. Leigh Creek coal is sub bituminous black coal, incorrectly called brown coal. The Leigh Creel coal also can spontaneously combust, but mainly at the coal field not at the power station storage site.Top up power is the extra that is generated by some fluffy thing such as renewables, (wind and solar), battery, and pumped hydro. It in theory is there to fill in the gap between base load and actual demand at a specific time zone.If the various political parties were actually intelligent, sorry mistake there, there would be a complete removal of all subsidies from all forms of renewable power sources, including domestic solar panels and the extensive transmission line needed. Also, no subsidies for domestic feed in traffic or home solar batteries.I have forgotten much of the geology and coal composition as I was working at Leigh Creek a long time ago. The main thing I do remember is both coals were moist and this was partly for the reason of the combustion.Simply they are not high quality thermal coals. Furnace burners must be designed specifically for these colas to get the correct heat and also fuel mix. Fuel mix is an issue, as in the Port Augusta Power station as there needed to be a fine line between coal and over burden to balance the burner flame.So the obvious conclusion here is that the warmunists really dont give a you-know-what about CO2  they just want to remake the modern world to their preferences by centralizing government control over our lives.A recent fact check by the ABC claimed there were 4 countries that were 100% renewable. The industrial powerhouses known as Albania, Nepal, Bhutan and Paraguay (I think) are as near as dammit 100% renewable because they are entirely reliant on hydro, which is perhaps a little irrelevant for most of Australia.I see AGL is moaning that nuclear is a distraction, and nukes cant be sited at coal generating stations because the sites will be repurposed for something else. They cant bear to have the subsidised cash-cow, high priced intermittent renewables, replaced.Modern SMRs are much cheaper than old large nuclear reactors.  One company has an estimated price of USD1.4 bn for two 500MW units Some of the designs which have received Governmental design approval in the USA and Canada have the ability to wrap up and down at a rate of 3% to 5% per minute from 25% capacity.
risk,The UK government revealed plans on Monday to boost Britains nuclear sector, for energy and defense, including massive investments in the future workforce and in its submarine program, which London views as its vital at-sea deterrent.UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has announced a package of public and private investment which is expected to cover the needs of Britains growing nuclear energy industry and to create 40,000 new jobs by 2030.The British government plans to partner with defense companies BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce and Babcock, as well as with French energy giant EDF, to invest more than 763 million ($961 million) by the end of the decade in the relevant skills, jobs and education, it said in a statement.Last year, the UK unveiled a plan to build eight new reactors and new-type small modular reactors by 2050, in an effort to produce 24 gigawatts of electricity, enough to provide a quarter of the countrys needs.The government also announced a commitment to invest up to 300 million ($379 million) in the production of the HALEU fuel required for new high-tech reactors, which is currently only commercially produced in Russia.Meeting the UKs ambitious nuclear targets will require a huge ramp up in all parts of the workforce, from engineering to construction, Tom Greatrex, Chief Executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said, commenting on the new investment plan.The major development initiative comes as the UK authorities work to ensure there will also be enough nuclear-energy-focused workers for the construction and maintenance of its fleet of submarines, which the UK considers vital for its national security, as they are the core of its continuous at-sea nuclear deterrent.Britain is set to expand its submarine industry, boosting its fleet under the AUKUS security pact. AUKUS (Australia, UK and US) was established in 2021. Under the pacts Pillar 1, the US and UK pledged to help Australia acquire nuclear-powered submarines, while Pillar 2 is a broader technology-sharing agreement.On Monday, the British Ministry of Defence published the Defence Nuclear Enterprise Command Paper, in which it underscores the need to sustain Britains nuclear deterrent in a period of heightened risk and volatility that is likely to last beyond the 2030s.
risk,He warned that failure to do so would be a major setback for energy transition. In a pointed criticism, Grossi told the FT that the refusal of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to fund new reactors puts them out of step with the wishes of their shareholders.(Image: Microsoft Bing AI via DALL-E 3)Grossi added that there has been a sea-change in attitudes towards nuclear energy and climate change. He said Russias invasion of Ukraine has pushed energy security to the top of priorities for policy makers globally. At the COP28 global climate meeting in the UAE last December the heads of 22 countriescalled for a triple scale expansionof nuclear energy by 2050.Grossi isnt alone in his advocacy for change at by development banks. The FT reported thatWilliam Magwood, the head of the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency, said he is also adding his voice to Grossis lobbying effort.Magwood told the FT that hes aware of efforts to create a separate nuclear development bank to fund new reactors. However, he also said he thinks that creating new nuclear development program offices in existing banks is a more likely outcome.Not everyone with ideas about global funding of nuclear energy thinks the multi-lateral banks are up to the task. In a post on Linked in,Daniel Dean, Chairman ofInternational Bank for Nuclear Infrastructure(IBNI), wrote;It may be difficult for European Investment Bank and other multilaterals to be effective in supporting nuclear given shareholder/governance issues, capitalization, expertise, standards, competition, etc. that are all unique to nuclear finance.Some of Deans views may be related to the policies of the Asian Development Bank. The FT reported that it does not finance nuclear energy projects due to low public acceptance, risks of nuclear proliferation, safety issues, and high investment costs.In the US the FT reported thatRep. Patrick McHenry(R-NC), who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, told the FT that US funding of nuclear energy is critical to meet the competitive threat of exports of reactors from Russia and China especially to developing nations.In February, McHenry and the Chairman of the Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion Subcommittee, French Hill (R-AR),reintroducedtheInternational Nuclear Energy Financing Act. This legislation, first introduced in 2021, would bring back financing for nuclear power at the World Bank and other international financial institutions. (Bill Text PDF file) (Committee backgrounder white paper)The International Nuclear Energy Financing Act would require the United States Executive Director at the World Bank to advocate and vote for financial assistance for nuclear energy. The bill would also permit U.S. representatives at other international financial institutions  including regional development banks for Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America  to push for nuclear projects. Taken together, the multilateral development banks can commit over $100 billion in annual financing.On the Senate side, in January 2023 U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV), Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources (ENR) Committee, and Jim Risch (R-ID), Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, reintroduced theInternational Nuclear Energy Act of 2023(INEA)S.826.Initially introduced in the 117thCongress, the bipartisan legislation promotes engagement with ally and partner nations to develop a civil nuclear export strategy and offset China and Russias growing influence on international nuclear energy development.(NucNet) In an interview a spokesman for theEuropean Investment Banktold the wire service that nuclear energy projects  potentially including research and development of small modular reactors (SMRs)  can be eligible for financing because they can be bankable under strict economic assessment criteriaIts true that we havent financed greenfield nuclear power generation in more than three decades. There are various reasons for that: any project that we finance must be bankable, meaning that we apply strict economic assessment criteria, the EIB spokesperson said.Each project is assessed on its own merits, depending on economic and financial viability, environmental viability, and technical viability. Europe needs to be present in those technologies, which can be relevant in meeting the Paris climate goals.According toGeorge Borovas, head of the global nuclear practice of international law firm Hunton Andrews Kurth, solving the significant differences between EU members states relating to new nuclear development would be the biggest challenge to any EIB vision to support SMR projects in Europe.Just like all major infrastructure projects, nuclear power presents many benefits that are long-term and sovereign in nature. These benefits are not necessarily captured in the economics of one project and may require sovereign support in the form of direct funding.Borovas said the support of organizations like the EIB, the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the proposed International Bank for Nuclear Infrastructure and export credit agencies, would signal that an individual project has been properly de-risked allowing for commercial investors to consider investment.Addressing climate change, energy security and sustainable development requires nuclear power. For the EU and its member states, now is the time to show their support in any form that is necessary to make these projects a reality, quickly.Last month, Czech finance ministerZbynek Stanjurasaid the country could look to EIB funding for new nuclear construction. Stanjura said changes in the energy mix, including an increased role for nuclear power were one of the strategic areas that would now not be covered by state funds.Earlier this week, a 12-nation European Nuclear Alliance* said momentum in the EU in favor of nuclear energy must now be converted into a comprehensive framework for nuclear development, exploring essential policies including financing. The alliance called for the formation of a working group on financing for new nuclear. The group would explore financing instruments such as support from the EIB or the EUs Innovation Fund to support the deployment of large-scale reactors and SMR technologies.Yves Desbazeille, director-general of Brussels-based industry group nucleareurope, told NucNet the demand for decarbonized electricity is expected to grow significantly over the next decades and the EU needs to ensure that it is providing adequate financing for the development of European net-zero sources of energy,The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC ) has directed the staff to publish aproposedrule anddraftguidance to establish a licensing process for commercial nuclear power plants that is risk- informed, performance-based, and technology-inclusive.The NRC is proposing a rule that will transform the way the agency reviews new reactor applications, while continuing to fulfill our mission to assure the safety of the public, saidNRC Chair Christopher Hanson.This proposed rule leverages significantly more risk insights than our existing regulatory framework in making safety determinations. Applicants can use our existing regulations today, but this proposed rule will provide future nuclear developers a clear, additional pathway for licensing.The proposed rule, to be published in the Federal Register in about six months, will create a new Part 53 section under the NRCs regulations (10 Code of Federal Regulations) as an alternative to the existing, large light water reactor licensing approaches under Parts 50 and 52.The rule, in meeting the requirements of theNuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act, will give plant designers and plant operators flexibility in determining how their nuclear power plant will meet safety criteria. The law was passed by Congress in 2019.The legislation directs the NRC to develop a licensing process for advanced nuclear reactors within two years and to complete a technology-inclusive licensing framework for optional use by advanced reactor designers by 2027. This move is vital sincedozens of companies and research institutionsare developing advanced reactor designs, including molten salt reactors, liquid-metal-cooled reactors and high-temperature gas reactors.The rule sets out criteria in areas including reactor siting requirements; analyzing potential accidents; defining safety functions; categorizing structures, systems, and components; addressing construction and manufacturing requirements; providing defense in depth; and protecting the public and plant workers during normal operations.NucNetreportedthat in astaff requirements memorandum(SRM) (ML24064A039) made public on March 4th, the Commission directed staff to incorporate several changes to a March 2023 draft proposal within six months of the SRMs issuance. The Commission also sent the staff back to the drawing board on several issues saying more work is needed on them.In adetailed assessmentof the commissions action published March 4th, analysts at the Breakthrough Institute, which wrote acritical reviewof the earlier NRC draft of Part 53, wrote, There is still a lot of work to do to form the NRC staffs draft and the Commissions direction into a viable rule. While the SRM provides a lot of information on the Commissions decision, it will take some time to complete an in-depth review of the 1,300+ pages in theSRM package.Part 53 is meant to offer a voluntary alternative to advanced nuclear applicants under a framework that would be technology-inclusive, meaning it is applicable to all reactor technologies. The framework would also be risk-informed, which means using information from risk assessments to focus safety analyses on important issues, and performance-based to ensure plants are regulated based on how they perform and not just how they are designed.The staffs effort to craft the proposed rule began in 2020. The staff conducted extensive public engagement with 21 rounds of public review and comment on preliminary rule language. The staff held 24 public meetings with stakeholders as well as 16 public meetings with NRCs independent advisory group, the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards. The staff will seek feedback from the public when it issues the proposed rule and draft guidance later this year.(DataCenterDynamics) Amazon Web Services (AWS)has acquiredTalen Energys data center campus which is located adjacent to a nuclear power station in Pennsylvania. As part of the March 4th deal, Talen will supply AWS with electric power via a 10-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) from the Susquehanna reactor site.Talen announced it has sold its 960MW Cumulus data center campus for $650 million to a major cloud service provider which Talen identified as Amazon. S&P Global Market Intelligencereportedadditional financial details of the acquisition.The company broke ground for the data center in 2021 and completed the first 48MW, 300,000 square foothyperscale facilityearly last year. The 1,200-acre data center campus gets its power from theSusquehanna Steam Electric Station(SSES).Hyperscale data centers are massive business-critical facilities designed to efficiently support robust, scalable applications and are often associated with big data-producing companies such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, IBM, and Microsoft among others.What further distinguishes hyperscale data centers is the volume of data, compute, and storage services they process. In asurvey, 93% of hyperscale companies expect to have 40 GigaBytes per second (Gbps) or faster network connections. In the same survey, 51% of respondents report that the bandwidth needed to manage vast volumes of data is an increasing challenge.Talen said AWS aims to develop a 960MW data center campus. The cloud company has minimum contractual power commitments that ramp up in 120MW increments over several years. The cloud provider also has two 10-year extension options, tied to nuclear license renewalsCommissioned in 1983 for energy company PPL, the 2,494MW Susquehanna Steam Electric Station is one of the largest nuclear power plants in the US. Its current owner,Talen Energy, was founded in 2015 after the competitive power generation business of PPL Corporation was spun off and combined with competitive generation businesses owned by private equity firmRiverstone Holdings.Riverstone Holdings LLC is an asset management firm that invests in the private markets primarily within energy, power and infrastructure. Since inception, it has raised over $40 billion of capital to invest.Talen Energy formed Cumulus Growth in 2020 to invest in opportunities created by the convergence of digital infrastructure and power and had two separate businesses; Cumulus Data, focused on hyperscale data centers; and Cumulus Coin, focused on digital currency mining. The crypto facility, also located at the Pennsylvania site, is not involved in the sale to Amazon.(WNN) On March 4th Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi witnessed the start of fuel loading at the 500 MWe PrototypeFast Breeder Reactor at Kalpakkamin Tamil Nadu. Fast breeder reactors form the second stage of Indias three-stage nuclear program. (Detailed Technical Image in Research Gate)The Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) has been developed by BHAVINI (Bharatiya Nabhikiya Vidyut Nigam Limited), a government enterprise under the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) which was set up in 2003 to focus on fast breeder reactors. Construction of the PFBR began in 2004, with an original expected completion date of 2010.India has adopted a three-stage nuclear power program, with the long-term goal of deploying a thorium-based closed nuclear fuel cycle. The first stage involves the use of pressurized heavy water reactors (PHWRs), fuelled by natural uranium, and light water reactors. The second stage involves reprocessing used fuel from the first stage to recover the plutonium to fuel FBRs. In stage 3, Advanced Heavy Water Reactors (AHWRs) will burn thorium-plutonium fuels and breed fissile uranium-233.The PFBR will initially use a core of uranium-plutonium mixed oxide (MOX) fuel, surrounded by a uranium-238 blanket, with plans to use a blanket of uranium and thorium to breed plutonium and U-233 for use as driver fuels for AHWRs.The DAE describes the PFBR as an advanced third generation reactor with inherent passive safety features which, since it recycles material recovered from used fuel from the first stage of the program, offers great advantage in terms of significant reduction in nuclear waste generated, thereby avoiding the need for large geological disposal facilities.In January, Modi formally dedicated the Demonstration Fast Reactor Fuel Reprocessing Plant at the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (ICGAR) in Kalpakkam, a precursor to large-scale plants for the reprocessing of fast reactor fuel, and in February, he visited the Kakrapar plant in Gujarat for the dedication of the first two Indian-designed and built 700 MWe PHWRs. The second of those units  Kakrapar 4  was connected to the grid just days later.The UK Government hasannouncedthat Great British Nuclear (GBN) will buy the Wylfa and Oldbury sites for new nuclear projects in a 160m deal with current owners Hitachi. The announcements, made in the Chancellors budget, also includes the launch of the next phase of GBNs Small Modular Reactor technology selection process.The Horizon Project was to develop two UK 1350 MW Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (ABWRs) at Wylfa Newydd to expand Hitachis nuclear business in the UK. The firm pulled out in January 2019. At the time it said, the project lacked economic rationality as a private company because it was clear that further time was needed to decide on a financing structure for the project, and the conditions for building and operating the nuclear power plants.At one time the UK government offered to take a significant equity stake in the project. However, Hitachi was reportedly spooked by the governments insistence on a fixed price contract without compensation for cost increases and schedule delays. The cancellation of the project punched a 2,700 MW hole in the governments then 19GW plan for new nuclear power plants.GBN is launching the next phase of Great British Nuclears Small Modular Reactor technology selection process. The six eligible companies will now be able toaccess tender documentation, allowing them to bid for potentially multi-billion-pound technology development contracts.Eligible bidders will have until June 2024 to submit their proposals. Successful bidders technologies will be allocated sites and incorporated into projects, and bidders will receive funding to develop their technology. The government promised to make the contract awards before the end of 2024. Successful bidders technologies will be allocated sites and incorporated into projects, and bidders will receive funding to develop their technology.Asannouncedin October 2023, the companies invited to tender are: EDF Energy, GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy International LLC, Holtec Britain Limited, NuScale Power, Rolls-Royce SMR and Westinghouse Electric Company UK Limited. Rolls-Royce has been particularly vocal about delays in the SMR program promoting itself as the home town team for the contract awards. Holtec recently announced a teaming arrangement with South Koreas Hyundai to pursue the contract.If you have an experience or insight to share or have learned something from a conference or seminar, your peers and colleagues on Energy Central want to hear about it.

risk,The pandemic highlighted issues surrounding supply chain resiliency, or the ability of a series of producers and logistics firms to withstand exogenous shocks (e.g., armed conflict, natural disaster). The challenges included panic buying and hoarding, factory closures, shortages of materials and labor, shipping delays and trade protectionism. Consider the difficulty in finding cleaning supplies, personal protective equipment and baby formula.Business leaders and policymakers are clarifying an array of U.S.-based manufacturing opportunities. Cost comparisons have increasingly favored local manufacturing when factoring automation, labor cost comparisons, government incentives and transportation costs. This is impacting an array of industries: defense and aerospace, automotive, electronics, machinery, chemicals, food and beverage, textiles, metals, plastics and rubber, and wood and paper products.Advanced techniques have made possible enhancements in automation, precision, speed, digitization, customization and sustainability. U.S.-based technology enhancements under the term Manufacturing 4.0 are changing the ways business leaders explore procurement opportunities. The technologies include artificial intelligence, robotics and automation, the Internet of Things (IoT), big data and analytics, digital simulation and sustainable production.Policy is an essential aspect of the macro-context within which economic, geopolitical, social and environmental trends impact tech development. As firms write their growth strategy, for both inorganic and organic growth, they evaluate financial returns (i.e., internal rate of return, net present value) for new product investment. This must reflect expectations regarding the future of policy and technology.Opportunity spaces develop, in part, because of technology and policy shifts. Industrial policy can preference those industries deemed a national strategic interest. Areas such as regulation, subsidies, procurement, direct investments and trade policy (i.e., tariffs) affect the capacity of manufacturers to compete for raw materials, employees, customers and private investment. Recent developments (paywall) in U.S. industrial policy have included proposed investments in Greentech, semiconductors and infrastructure.Industrial policy is written to balance social concerns, national security and economic dynamism. Priorities include job creation, wage levels and domestic resiliency. The Whitehouse has developed a comprehensive list of Critical & Emerging Technologies. The list includes advanced computing, advanced engineering materials, advanced gas turbines, advanced and networked sensing and signature management, advanced nuclear energy, autonomous systems, biotechnologies, communication and networking technologies, directed energy, financial technologies, human-machine interfaces, hypersonics, semiconductors and microelectronics, and space technologies and systems.The investment and procurement programs help advance projects by mobilizing public dollars, which catalyze private investment. For example, NASA recently joined us at the University of Richmond to discuss innovation advancements in aerospace technologies, and how the NASA Technology Transform Program helps private citizens commercialize new productsfrom optics to propulsion, and from deep tech to applications in consumer goods.Within the policy context, numerous stakeholders engage in technology development through research. It spans the breadth of engineering (e.g., mechanical, electrical, materials, geological) and combinations of technologies have proven compelling areas of opportunity. These combinations provide new ways to solve problems and extend benefits to target customers. This is applicable for both incremental improvements for existing products, as well as the creation of disruptive new products.For example, AI and blockchain combinations. Dr. Swati Sachan and I recently co-authored Can the Responsible Use of Generative AI be Governed by Blockchains Decentralization and Immutability? as well as No. 1 of the 20 Hot Small Business Trends Todays Leaders are Watching.Emerging areas of innovation through combination include the commercialization of quantum computing applied to both manufacturing and energy. Computational power is being applied for weather modeling and trade route estimation, related risk management, optimization of blended power grids (i.e., small modular reactors, solar and conventional generation) and applications of hydrogen fuel cells. The Financial Times claims that (paywall) the yield curve has yet to deliver a recession because the real curve has only just inverted. And according to Forbes, The yield curve continues to flash a recession warning.First, find emerging revenue opportunities. This includes identifying patterns of new demand, particularly counter-cyclical demand where product development can be enhanced through tech combinations. Generative AI is showing the capacity to enhance R&D initiatives.Second, understand the cost implications. Consider onshore manufacturing as a lower-cost, lower-risk option. The "higher for longer" economic context means related hurdle rates have increased. Advance only the most promising, synergistic product development initiatives.Third, leverage U.S. industrial policy that strengthens innovation and supply chain resilience. Demonstrate commitments to localized manufacturing, built to export products, ESOP plans for employee ownership, partnerships that advance related entrepreneurship and the utilization of incentives to locate in disadvantaged communities (e.g., opportunity zones and enterprise zones).
risk,This was immediately dismissed by Premier Roger Cook, and environmentalists pointed to disasters such as the 2011 accident at the uranium-powered Fukushima nuclear plant as evidence of its inherent danger.However, industry observers say the public often attaches the risks of nuclear power to uranium mining  despite them being separate issues and a viable uranium mining trade could be established if it undertook some reputational repair work.
risk,In Georgia, demand for industrial power is surging to record highs, with the projection of new electricity use for the next decade now 17 times what it was only recently. Arizona Public Service, the largest utility in that state, is also struggling to keep up, projecting it will be out of transmission capacity before the end of the decade absent major upgrades. In Northern Virginia, the equivalent of several new large nuclear power plants are needed to serve all the new data centers planned and under construction. Texas, where electricity shortages are already routine on hot summer days, faces the same dilemma. The soaring demand is forcing electricity providers to scramble to try to squeeze more juice out of America's aging power grid while pushing commercial customers to go to extraordinary lengths to lock down their energy supply needs, such as by helping build their new power plants. When you look at the numbers, it is staggering, said Jason Shaw, chairman of the Georgia Public Service Commission, which regulates electricity. It makes you scratch your head and wonder how we ended up in this situation. How were the projections that far off? This has created a challenge like we have never seen before. The administration of President Joe Biden claims it has made easing the grid bottleneck a priority. Even if this were true, federal powers are limited and the whole process is politically fraught, at best. Building new transmission lines and transfer stations involves huge land acquisitions, exhaustive environmental reviews and negotiations with multiple partners to determine who should pay what costs.Thanks to your generous support, we are building the infrastructure of human freedom and actively donating our technology to independent publishers, authors and home schooling organizations.

Regulators are worried that residential ratepayers could be stuck with the bill for costly upgrades. Climate activists are also concerned that the surging demand for power could stifle the transition to cleaner energy, especially as utility executives continue to lobby government authorities to delay the retirement of fossil fuel plants and bring more online to keep supply stable.Rapid AI innovations driving surge in demand for electricity A major factor behind the skyrocketing demand is the rapid innovation in artificial intelligence, which is driving the construction of large warehouses of computing infrastructure that require exponentially more power than traditional data centers. Tech mogul Elon Musk has even warned that the U.S. could run out of electricity and transformers for AI by 2025. AI is also part of a huge scale-up in cloud computing. Tech firms like Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta and Microsoft are scouring the nation for sites for new data centers, and many lesser-known firms are also on the hunt. (Related: Rosemount, Minnesota trying to establish 15-minute city with the help of Zuckerberg's Meta.) But these same tech giants are also exploring ways in which AI can help make the grid operate more efficiently, such as by developing platforms that, during times of peak power demand, "can shift compute tasks and their associated energy consumption to the times and places where carbon-free energy is available on the grid," said Google in a statement.

Climate activists are also concerned that the surging demand for power could stifle the transition to cleaner energy, especially as utility executives continue to lobby government authorities to delay the retirement of fossil fuel plants and bring more online to keep supply stable.Rapid AI innovations driving surge in demand for electricity A major factor behind the skyrocketing demand is the rapid innovation in artificial intelligence, which is driving the construction of large warehouses of computing infrastructure that require exponentially more power than traditional data centers. Tech mogul Elon Musk has even warned that the U.S. could run out of electricity and transformers for AI by 2025. AI is also part of a huge scale-up in cloud computing. Tech firms like Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta and Microsoft are scouring the nation for sites for new data centers, and many lesser-known firms are also on the hunt. (Related: Rosemount, Minnesota trying to establish 15-minute city with the help of Zuckerberg's Meta.) But these same tech giants are also exploring ways in which AI can help make the grid operate more efficiently, such as by developing platforms that, during times of peak power demand, "can shift compute tasks and their associated energy consumption to the times and places where carbon-free energy is available on the grid," said Google in a statement.

risk,The AI boom is in full swing, with Microsoft and OpenAI teaming up to build a $100 billion AI supercomputer, Amazon planning to spend $150 billion on data centers, and Meta planning to install 50,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs by the end of 2024. These are mind-boggling projects, and with powerful GPU hardware at the heart of them, you can be sure that the power bills will be astronomical.Governments and big tech are aware of the "AI power issue" and are looking at nuclear energy as a potential solution. US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm spoke with Axiom to confirm that it plans to accelerate discussions with companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon to host "small nuclear plants" next to their massive data centers.Nuclear power for data centers is not an outlandish idea. Last year, we reported on Microsoft hiring a Principal Program Manager of Nuclear Technology to implement a Small Modular Reactor (SMR) and microreactor energy strategy.Small Modular Reactor (SMR) technology involves compact and transportable plug-and-play reactors; however, these reactors could still be years away from real-world applications. "How do you bring down that cost so that utilities are willing to take on the risk of SMRs?" Jennifer Granholm said.Building nuclear reactors next to every significant AI data center might sound reactionary. However, nuclear energy is currently the only "clean" energy that can provide the power required by modern AI data centers.Kosta is a veteran gaming journalist that cut his teeth on well-respected Aussie publications like PC PowerPlay and HYPER back when articles were printed on paper.

risk,HOUSTON, Texas  In a video message projected onto massive screens in a packed conference hall, Sultan al-Jaber, the president of the COP28 climate conference held in the United Arab Emirates last year, graciously accepted a leadership award from one of the worlds biggest energy industry conventions.Al-Jaber, who when not running UN climate summits is also the CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, faced criticism from environmental groups for inviting major oil and gas companies to participate in the international climate negotiations. He also faced scrutiny for his comments that its not necessary to eliminate fossil fuels to meet the Paris Agreement target of limiting warming this century to less than 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) by the end of the century. But here in Houston, before a much friendlier crowd, he remained defiant.If the world is going to meet its climate goals, every stakeholder has to act, al-Jaber said, with a model of a wind turbine on his desk. Everyone had a seat at the table, everyone was invited to contribute, and everyone did contribute.It is no exaggeration to say that [al-Jaber] helped the global community chart pathways to a sustainable future, said Daniel Yergin, the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning oil history The Prize and the founder of CERAWeek.While only a sliver of the size of the last climate meeting  more than 8,000 delegates were at CERAWeek compared to more than 80,000 attendees at COP28  the conference represents some of the most powerful companies in the world with trillions of dollars at their disposal to shape the future of global energy and the climate. The theme this year was Multidimensional Energy Transition: Markets, climate, technology and geopolitics.The unwieldy title is an example of how the convention has grown in scope since it started in 1981 and how the industries it represents have begun to redefine their roles in a world constrained by rising average temperatures, yet still primarily dependent on fossil fuels. What was once a low-key meeting of oil and gas executives and analysts to talk frankly and cut deals has become a slick news-making tech conference where attendees are well fed and, after hours, well lubricated by sponsors. Think of it as Davos for the oil and gas set, hosted in the energy capital of the US.Twenty years ago you could not have a conversation here about climate change. Full stop, Mark Brownstein, senior vice president for energy transition at the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), who has attended the conference for decades, told Vox.By now everyone at CERAWeek has gotten the memo on global warming and understood the assignment, at least in rhetoric. The worlds largest energy firms have come to a general consensus that the world is shifting toward clean energy  but that fossil fuels are still going to be necessary for the foreseeable future. These truths are not in conflict, said Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm. The momentum of the clean energy transition is undeniable, even as we are the largest producer of oil and gas in the world.Every talk and panel discussion nodded to the energy transition, toward carbon management, efficiency, and clean tech. When it comes to energy sources  wind, solar, hydropower, natural gas, oil, hydrogen, coal, nuclear, geothermal, and even fusion  CERAWeek has truly embraced diversity, equity, and inclusion.But even with greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere reaching levels not seen in eons and after the hottest year humans have ever measured, the fossil fuel industry whose products are driving climate change sees a bright future for itself. After all, despite the extraordinary expansion of clean energy generation, fossil fuels have only lost a small share of the global energy mix and are still expecting more growth.The majors believe that technologies like carbon capture and storage will allow them to continue selling their wares as emissions regulations ratchet down, and that power-devouring technologies like artificial intelligence and growing markets in developing countries will continue to raise demand. By some estimates, data center electricity use is on track to more than double by 2026. Coal, oil, and natural gas consumption are at or near record highs in many parts of the world and their emissions are currently on track to grow through 2050, according to the Energy Information Administration. The world is hungry for BTUs and watts, and the energy industry is eager to serve them.But that optimism hasnt been matched with urgency on climate change, and the industry has a long history of slowing progress. While the language has changed more recently, the oil and gas industry has spent decades thwarting action on climate change, with lobbying, litigation, and misinformation. Exxons own scientists produced accurate internal forecasts of rising average temperatures as early as the 1970s while the company published full-page ads in newspapers casting doubt on warming into the late 1990s.Russias ongoing invasion of Ukraine has also put energy security back on the front burner. For some countries, energy security today matters more than climate change tomorrow, leading them to prioritize secure sources, including fossil fuels in some cases. (Energy security wasnt the only echo of the war  CERAWeek also helpfully reminded participants in its registration form not to attend if they are subject to sanctions.)So while appetites for cleaner energy sources are growing, the stalwarts of the global energy industry have made it clear they arent letting go of the fuels that powered their rise. As these companies have grudgingly come to acknowledge climate change, many concerned about global warming have also begun to grapple with the likelihood that fossil fuels arent fading away anytime soon. And while most energy companies do envision reducing their greenhouse gas emissions, the current pace is nowhere near fast enough to bend the curve to meet climate goals. The future for the global energy industry is not just brighter, but hotter.Across the skybridge from the hotel in the neighboring convention center, CERAWeek hosts what it calls Innovation Agora, where tech entrepreneurs and energy startups pitch their solutions to climate change in glass-walled booths under purple lights. It was once the kids table of the conference when it launched in 2017 but has since evolved into a parallel production, a clear reflection of clean energys massive growth and immense potential.The fossil fuel industry talks less about competition between conventional sources and renewables and more about collaboration between the molecule and the electron solution set, as Exxons Woods described it. The molecules are the hydrocarbons of coal, oil, and gas and increasingly, hydrogen, while the electrons are those generated by solar panels and wind turbines.Unsurprisingly, the molecule companies have their eyes set on the technologies that play to their strengths. Hydrogen, a gas most commonly produced by reforming methane, fits well into the fossil fuel industrys existing refining, pipeline, storage, and retail infrastructure. Geothermal, which harnesses heat from beneath the Earths surface, draws on the sectors expertise in geology and drilling. Carbon capture  from smokestacks, from the ocean, from the air  gives fossil fuels a way to zero out their emissions, at least on paper, extending them a lifeline in a world where emissions must ratchet down. In the US, the Biden administration has set a target of cutting national greenhouse gas emissions in half compared to 2005 levels by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions by 2050.US government incentives are sweetening the deal for cleaner energy technologies. The trio of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act have mobilized billions of dollars to research, build, and deploy low-emissions energy systems and the products that enable them. Unlike past legislative attempts to tackle climate change, these laws are almost all incentives, with no restrictions or caps on greenhouse gases baked in.As for the villains, the energy industry as well as environmental groups found a common adversary in methane. Its about 30 times more powerful than carbon dioxide when it comes to trapping heat in the atmosphere. Its the dominant component of natural gas, so producers do have an incentive to limit its leaks since its a salable product. At COP28, dozens of oil and gas firms committed to ending their methane pollution by 2050. Simply reducing methane output by 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030 could avert 0.2C of warming (0.36F) by 2050. But methane is colorless and odorless, making it hard to detect where its escaping, and estimates of its emissions vary widely.These concerns have fertilized the growth of the carbon accounting and verification business. Context Labs, one of the companies presenting at the Agora, has developed software so companies can track emissions across their facilities, sometimes down to individual pieces of hardware like generators or furnaces. The goal is to give companies actionable information about where they need to cut pollution, how they can route their operations to be more carbon efficient, and what assets will be at risk when emissions regulations get stricter.Not everyone is ready to take these companies at their word, though. The Environmental Defense Fund launched a satellite to track global methane emissions just a few days before CERAWeek began and advertised it on the streets of Houston. EDF plans to publish its findings publicly to spur polluters to act.There were still points of friction at the oil-soaked conference, as explained by Amin Nasser, president and CEO of Saudi Aramco. Its not just the worlds largest oil company, with nearly four times the market capitalization of ExxonMobil; its the fourth-mightiest of all companies, shaping economies around the world. And as a mostly state-run enterprise under an autocratic regime, Saudi Aramco isnt as swayed by activists or shareholders as a fully investor-owned company like Exxon.The first is that alternatives to hydrocarbons like wind and solar energy have received decades of research and development and billions of dollars in investment, but still hold single-digit market shares. Second, reducing the carbon intensity of fossil fuels  particularly through energy efficiency and switching from coal and oil to natural gas  has delivered greater greenhouse gas emissions reductions than the rise of clean energy. Third is that many alternative energy strategies like electric vehicles are unaffordable for a majority of people around the world. That ties into the fourth point, that most of global energy demand growth in the coming years will occur in developing countries. But despite representing 85 percent of the worlds population, these countries receive a tiny fraction of clean energy investment.Nasser concluded with his fifth point: that the energy transition strategy of replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy needs a reset. We should abandon the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas and instead invest in them adequately, reflecting realistic demand assumptions, Nasser said to widespread applause. We should ramp up our effort to reduce carbon emissions, improve efficiency and introduce lower carbon solutions. And we should phase in new energy sources and technologies when they are genuinely ready, economically competitive, and with the right infrastructure.Many activists and other in the energy industry disagree with Nassers assessment. However, his comments echo the ongoing rifts at COP meetings between major fossil fuel-producing countries that became rich off oil and those often poorer countries facing the immediate effects of climate change like sea level rise, who want to see fossil fuel consumption zeroed out. Its led to long, tortuous negotiations over language like phase down versus phase out and unabated emissions from fossil fuels.But while many zero-carbon technologies are still expensive, so too are the systems required to keep burning coal, oil, and gas in a world where emissions must halt by the middle of the century to meet climate targets. Some of the cheapest carbon capture technologies to date still cost about $40 per metric ton of carbon dioxide, adding up to billions of dollars to capture any meaningful share of the 37.4 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emitted last year.The US, now the worlds largest oil producer and natural gas exporter, is also in an awkward spot. While pledging to reduce its own emissions, the US is anticipating more fossil fuel exports and financing import facilities in other countries. That includes a doubling of liquefied natural gas shipments abroad by 2030, despite the White Houses pause on new export terminals. The whole world needs to transition away from fossil fuels, but in the meantime, we still have to support our friends and allies in their energy needs, John Podesta, the White House climate adviser who also leads climate diplomacy, told reporters.Now in an election year, the Biden administration is trying to walk the line between taking credit for low gasoline prices and facilitating more fossil fuel extraction as it faces a challenger who wants to ramp up coal, oil, and natural gas, potentially adding another 4 billion metric tons by 2030 to the USs already massive greenhouse gas emissions tally.All the while, the era of low interest rates that drove the massive expansion of both renewables and natural gas in the US in the past decade is ending just as the country needs a massive new buildout of energy production and infrastructure. Financing expenses are getting higher while permitting time and costs remain an obstacle, slowing down the shift to cleaner energy. So while the threats from climate change are more apparent than ever, its getting harder to wield the tools to keep it in check, and that means the fuels of the industrial revolution will continue to light the road ahead, for a while at least.At Vox, we believe that clarity is power, and that power shouldnt only be available to those who can afford to pay.

But the banking industry is pushing back, arguing that the rule will have knock-on consequences which will ultimately be worse for consumers. If credit card users aren't deterred from paying late by a high fee, then they may miss more payments, resulting in lower credit scores and reduced access to credit, the Bank Policy Institute argues.In 1997, Gregg Hymowitz and a couple of colleagues from Goldman Sachs launched EnTrust Capital with 125 clients and $750 million in assets. Today, EnTrust has grown into a firm with $18.7 billion in assets, and Hymowitz himself is worth $1.7 billion between his 80% stake in EnTrust, his personal investments in EnTrust funds and other assets.

But which actors in the crowd made the most money last year?Margot Robbie and Ryan Goslingthe stars of Barbie, which is nominated for eight Oscarsare ranked No. 2 and No. 4 respectively on this years top 10 based solely on their estimated earnings from box office, video on-demand and the movies first streaming window. Their total compensation for starring in the cultural phenomenon will be considerably higher.In total, the 10 highest-paid stars combined to earn $449 million in 2023. They come almost exclusively from movies, rather than television, thanks in part to the writers and actors strikes that shut down Hollywood for half the year and delayed (or shortened) a number of TV seasons, and partially due to the now decades-long precedent that top movie stars can command up to $20 million up front for a single movie plus a percentage of its profits.At the top of the list? None other than 57-year-old funnyman Adam Sandler, who earned an estimated $73 million last year (after paying fees to his agent, manager and lawyer). Since signing his first $250 million four-picture deal with Netflix in 2014, Sandler has starred in eight movies for the streaming giant and produced several more through his Happy Madison production company. The majority of his back catalog of comedies are now licensed on the platform as well. In the first six months of 2023 alone, Netflix subscribers spent more than 500 million hours watching Sandlers movies.WHY IT MATTERS Beyond the hefty salaries, whats truly been earned by this years highest-paid stars is greater power within the industry, particularly the ability to negotiate for even more favorable deal terms on their next project. In an industry where pay can rise or fall based on each performance, this list represents a snapshot of who has the most leverage in Hollywood in 2024.The University of Iowa womens basketball game against Ohio State University over the weekendin which Iowa's Caitlin Clark broke the all-time NCAA scoring recordwas the most-watched regular season women's basketball game in 25 years, according to Fox:5.18 million: The average number of viewers watched the men's Michigan State-Arizona game on Thanksgiving, the only regular season college basketball game this season that had a higher viewership than the Iowa women's game, according to Sports Media WatchCongress has quite a lot on its to-do list, including a number of potential changes that could affect federal taxes for 2023.

risk,Matthew Szydagis, 41, has spent the last two years toiling in a laboratory deep beneath the University of Albany campus, blasting bits of lithium with ion beams to test the nature of its fission reactions.The physics professor discovered that lithium, commonly used in cellphone batteries used in phones, cars, and other technologies, only becomes fissionable when hit by the ions  and stabilizes when the beams stop.The concept is to have fission that you can turn on and turn off, Szydagis told The Post. Thats what really creates the incredible safety factor and makes it completely different from standard nuclear power.All of our nuclear power plants were created after the Manhattan Project and after the bomb. So the only way we knew how to make nuclear energy was to take the same technology and same ideas from bombs, Szydagis said, explaining that uranium has remained the standard fuel in nuclear plants throughout their history.Szydagis model could also potentially negate the dangers of uranium waste created from standard nuclear reactors. Unlike uranium, which can take almost a billion years to no longer be radioactive, fissioned lithium takes a matter of hours, minutes, worst case days or weeks to become safe.Though only tested on small samples so far, if Szydagis lithium-based model scales as he expects it would have the potential to replace uranium in reactors across the world  and possibly eliminate the public safety fears that have prevented the clean energy source from powering the entire planet.The beauty of nuclear power  any nuclear power, my idea as well as traditional uranium-based plants  is that they can be built with nearly zero carbon footprint and run with nearly zero CO2 output, he said.Szydagis believes that a climate change cataclysm has already begun and estimates that New York City will be underwater by 2100 if nothing is done to prevent it. However, if successful, his lithium-based nuclear energy could have an enormous impact on keeping future generations safe.Ill put it very bluntly  someone sitting in New York may not end up underwater anymore in 50 years if his idea succeeds, he explained. So I would say thats a pretty big impact: to not have Manhattan become the next lost city of Atlantis.Dark matter hunters spend their time creating neutrons to throw at detectors  something the University of Albanys subterranean particle collider is uniquely equipped for  and during such experimentation with his team Szydagis struck on the lithium idea.The process remains in its early stages. Szydagis has a patent pending and is looking for funding to expand the size of his experiments, which he will then write up into a paper for peer review and then look at further expansion.Im not claiming any new physics. Im not saying Ive got some crackpot zero point energy or some magical thing that doesnt actually exist  Im doing bread and butter, nuclear fission thats been understood for many, many decades.

risk,The largest uranium producer in the United States is ramping up work just south of Grand Canyon National Park on a long-contested project that comes as global instability and growing demand drive uranium prices higher.The Biden administration and dozens of other countries have pledged to triple the capacity of nuclear power worldwide in their battle against climate change, and policy changes are being adopted by some to lessen Russia's influence over the supply chain.But as the U.S. pursues its nuclear power potential, environmentalists and Native American leaders remain fearful of the consequences for communities near mining and milling sites in the West and are demanding more regulatory oversight.The new mining at Pinyon Plain Mine near the Grand Canyon is happening within the boundaries of the Baaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukv National Monument that was designated in August by President Joe Biden. The work was allowed to move forward since Energy Fuels Inc. had valid existing rights.The mine will cover 6.8 hectares (16.8 acres) and operate for just a few years, producing about 907,000 kilograms (about 2 million pounds) of uranium  enough to power the state of Arizona for at least a year with carbon-free electricity, he said.Energy Fuels, which also is prepping two more mines in Colorado and Wyoming, was awarded a contract in 2022 to sell $18.5 million in uranium concentrates to the U.S. government to help establish the nation's strategic reserve for when supplies might be disrupted.Amid the growing appetite for uranium, a coalition of Native Americans testified before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in late February, asking the panel to pressure the U.S. government to overhaul outdated mining laws and prevent further exploitation of marginalized communities.Carletta Tilousi, who served for years on the Havasupai Tribal Council, said she and others have written countless letters to state and federal agencies and have sat through hours of meetings with regulators and lawmakers. Her tribe's reservation lies in a gorge off the Grand Canyon.Numerous legal challenges aimed at stopping the Pinyon Plain Mine repeatedly have been rejected by the courts, and top officials in the Biden administration are reticent to weigh in beyond speaking generally about efforts to improve consultation with Native American tribes.It's just the latest battle over energy development and sacred lands, as tribes in Nevada and Arizona are fighting the federal government over the mining of lithium and the siting of renewable energy transmission lines.The Havasupai are concerned mining could affect water supplies, wildlife, plants and geology throughout the Colorado Plateau, and the Colorado River flowing through the Grand Canyon and its tributaries are vital to millions of people across the West.The Pinyon Plain Mine, formerly known as the Canyon Mine, was permitted in 1984. With existing rights, it was grandfathered into legal operation despite a 20-year moratorium placed on uranium mining in the Grand Canyon region by the Obama administration in 2012.The U.S. Forest Service in 2012 reaffirmed an environmental impact statement that had been prepared for the mine years earlier, and state regulators signed off on air and aquifer protection permitting within the last two years.Using nuclear power to reach emissions goals is a hard sell in the western U.S. From the Navajo Nation to Ute Mountain Ute and Oglala Lakota homelands, tribal communities have deep-seated distrust of uranium companies and the federal government as abandoned mines and related contamination have yet to be cleaned up.Teracita Keyanna with the Red Water Pond Road Community Association got choked up while testifying before the human rights commission in Washington, D.C., saying federal regulators proposed keeping onsite soil contaminated by past operations in New Mexico rather than removing it."It's really unfair that we have to deal with this and my children have to deal with this and later on, my grandchildren have to deal with this," she said. "Why is the government just feeling like we're disposable. We're not."Congresswoman Cori Bush of Missouri said during a congressional meeting in January that lawmakers can't talk about expanding nuclear energy in the U.S. without first dealing with the effects that nuclear waste has had on minority communities. In Bush's district in St. Louis, waste was left behind from the uranium refining required by the top-secret Manhattan Project.
risk,An African woman prepares traditional injera bread in her home in Berhale, Ethiopia. Climate alarmists anti-fossil fuel mania would keep those like her in the Third World from ever enjoying the modernity of electricity and thereby keep them cooking and heating their homes by burning wood and dried dung. Reliance on those methods exposes her and millions of others around the world to harmful fumes, leading to serious health issues, such as lung disease, blindness, and premature death. (Photo: Roberto Moiola/Sysaworld/ Moment/Getty Images)We all want a future where humans can thrive in a clean environment. But as the eye-opening documentary Climate the Movie: The Cold Truth reveals, while we hear dire warnings that we must rapidly eliminate fossil fuels to avoid a climate catastrophe, we are manufacturing a humanitarian crisis of our own.That means maintaining an energy mix that can handle natures curveballs. It means maximizing our options, not banning entire categories of energy the world still needs. But as environmentalists seek to ban fossil fuels, they are raising the price of electricity for some and depriving others in emerging economies of that valuable resource.The movie aired on YouTube the same week that the Environmental Protection Agency issued final regulations requiring 70% of new cars sold to be hybrid or battery-powered electric by 2032. But that raises costs and inconveniences households for no gain, because banning fossil fuels in America would not affect global temperatures.Despite headlines about worsening hurricanes, data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows no long-term increase in the frequency or intensity of U.S. hurricanes since records began being kept in the mid-1800s.For the worlds poorest nations, giving up fossil fuels is catastrophic. Affordable, dependable power is a life-or-death matter when it comes to delivering basic needs, such as health care, sanitation, safe drinking water, and protection from heat waves and cold snaps.Germanys renewable-energy mandates have driven consumer prices to more than triple the levels seen in the United States. This entirely avoidable situation places a heavy burden on German businesses, unnecessarily increasing their operating costs.By all means, lets use renewable technologies as they become reliable and cost-effective, including nuclear energy. Attempting to legislate an accelerated transition is a recipe for disaster when reality collides with wishful thinking.This is a critical year in the history of our country. Americans are polarized and divided. Roughly half of the country is clamoring for socialist policies like more government control over health care, increased regulations, and open borders. We must turn to Americas founding for the answers.The Heritage Foundation has compiled input from more than 100 constitutional scholars and legal experts into the countrys most thorough and compelling review of the freedoms promised to us within the United States Constitution, now available as a free digital guide called.

risk,The House bill [H.R. 6544] would also extend the Price-Anderson federal accident insurance subsidy, first enacted in 1957 and renewedseven timessince then. The program expires at the end of 2025. It isnt clear why this federal subsidy for nuclear in still needed when the industry insists its new, advanced reactor designs are inherently walk-away safe.The U.S. nuclear industry in recent days has hit three cherries on the federal money-and-policy slot machine. The open question is whether the largess (some might call itpork) will have the intended results: revitalizing a moribund industry by hitching its wagon to the feverish fear of climate change and long-run animosity toward nuclear rivals China and Russia.First, the moneythe most tangible of the goodies Congress and the White House have doled out. On March 5, the ranking members of the House and Senate appropriations committees rolled out a consensus on six money balls, including theEnergy and Water Development and Related Agencies billfunding all government nuclear programs for fiscal year 2024. Passage is almost certainly a done deal.On February 28, the House by an overwhelming 365-36 bipartisan margin passedH.R. 6544, designed to streamline safety reviews by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and give the Department of Energy some authority to buy electricity through purchase power agreements from commercial nuclear power purveyors.In some respects, the legislation is a return to the approach of the now-defunct Atomic Energy Commission in the early days of atomic energy. In 1974,Congress abolished the AEC, and the all-power congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, in large part because the AEC viewed reactor safety as a poor cousin to promotion the atom.to ensure that, while upholding the policies of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA), the licensing and regulation of nuclear activities are carried out efficiently without unduly restricting the potential of nuclear energy and to improve the general welfare and the benefits of nuclear technology to society.Some observers have suggested this hortatory language is unlikely to survive in the Senate. Senators are trying to combine House provisions with a separate bipartisan bill that passed last year as part of the National Defense Authorization Act but was later axed.The legislation would also create a cadre of up to 210 Supergrade nuclear ninjas, possibly paid more than NRC commissioners in some cases. According to the bill language, under some circumstances, the NRC chairman Chairman may, during any period when such a certification is in effect, fix the compensation for such employees or other personnel serving in a covered position without regard to any provision of title 5, United States Code, governing General Schedule classification and pay rates. These alleged experts appear to have the power to second-guess the Senate-confirmed commissioners.The House bill would also extend the Price-Anderson federal accident insurance subsidy, first enacted in 1957 and renewedseven times since then. The program expires at the end of 2025. It isnt clear why this federal subsidy for nuclear in still needed when the industry insists its new, advanced reactor designs are inherently walk-away safe. Congress apparently believes it can assess the risks of nuclear energy more accurately than private sector actuaries.On March 4, the NRC rejected a staff-written draft rule developed over three years for how to regulate the potential new license applications for a variety of advanced reactors. The commission told the staff to rewrite its proposal for a new Part 53 section of the agencys authority embodied in 10 Code of Federal Regulations, joining the current sections 50 and 52, which pertain to large light-water reactors.According to Utility Dive, a key change ordered by the commission rejected a strict checklist of requirements for probabilistic risk assessments while favoring a more flexible framework suited to simplified reactor designs with passive safety features that utilize natural forces, such as gravity or pressure differentials, rather than operator action.In a news release, NRC Chairman Christopher Hanson said, This proposed rule leverages significantly more risk insights than our existing regulatory framework in making safety determinations. Applicants can use our existing regulations today, but this proposed rule will provide future nuclear developers a clear, additional pathway for licensing. The NRC said it expects to publish the new rule in the Federal Register in about six months.This latest effort to revive the largely stagnant U.S. nuclear program is the third time in the last nearly 20 years that the government has tried to pump new life into atomic power. The U.S. program started grinding to a halt in the mid-1970s and was barely treading water by the 1990s. The pipeline of new reactor licenses emptied in 1974, and as the final builders of plants under construction either completed or abandoned their projects, the workforce and supply chain infrastructure hollowed out.In 2005, Congress passed a new Energy Policies Act, which offered a smorgasbord of financial goodies for new plants including loans (they called them loan guarantees to make them look more palatable to opponents of direct federal subsidies, but the Treasury wrote the checks and received the loan payments), cost overrun protections, and extension of Price-Anderson to 2025.The 2005 act was largely a failure. The two preeminent U.S. nuclear power developers, Westinghouse and General Electric, ended up sorely financially injured and in Japanese hands. Former NRC CommissionerPeter Bradford commented, They placed a big bet on this hallucination of a nuclear renaissance.Then came the first push for small modular reactors, designed to downsize the financial risks and construction costs of nuclear power plants. The strategy was the reverse of the economies of scale that drove the first generation of nuclear power plants, where bigger was always assumed to be better, but wasnt.In 2009, reactor vendor Babcock & Wilcox, which had substantial experience building nuclear power plants for U.S. submarines, announced it would offer a 125-MW pressurized water reactor (later scaled up to 180 MW) and a year later unveiled an alliance with builder Bechtel Corp. They called the project mPower.In 2012, the Obama administration announced a $500 million program for development of small modular reactors. In 2013, mPower won financial assistance from DOE, with an award up to around $126 million. The same year, B&W tried and failed to sell a majority share of mPower, then cut back funding by 75%. Bechtel soon soured on the project, and it officially ran out of steam in 2017 after failure to find a customer.Will the latest government attempt to revive nuclear, driven by global warming concerns, succeed? Its not a given. Theres lots to like about smaller nukes. They produce no CO2, have a relatively small footprint, can be sited fairly close to load.But the economics arent clear, as theNuScale sagademonstrates. Some of the non-LWR advanced reactor designs will present licensing challenges, as there is little history behind them. Sodium cooled fast reactors may be particularly problematic, given the well-known problems of sodium as a coolant and the experience with Superphenix in France and Monju in Japan, plus issues of nuclear weapons proliferation.During my tenure as CEO of a uranium exploration company (Calypso Uranium) I was an officially designated representative of Argentina at the 2005 IAEA Semi-Annual Redbook International Symposium, in Vienna, Austria (IAEA Headquarters).  The proceedings were published as: Uranium production and raw materials for the nuclear fuel cycle-Supply and demand, economics, the environment and energy security (my name is on p.333).  This gave me an opportunity to question leading experts in all phases of the nuclear issue, and the bottle-neck soon became clear.  The Critical Path, for construction and commissioning a nuclear power reactor, was not predictable, due to constant environmentalist lawsuits and the dramatic changes in politics associated with election cycle results.  The result, failure to assemble a realistic economic analysis, was a Fatal Flaw.  All of the above report, encouraging as it is, needs to address the lawfare assault on Nuclear Energy, or the advances will be only in totalitarian regimes.As a consumer, this is not a political or environmental issue for me. It is all about what is the biggest dollar win in the cheapest energy input.  Since I live in PA where there is enormous NG reserves, I am going to be dubious about Nuke guys blaming environmentalists for their inability to tell me they have a better deal for me.  Frack on!Theres lots to like about big and small nukes but the fact that they produce no CO2 isnt an example  its irrelevant. In fact, if anything, its a drawback of nuclear energy  increased CO2 has already increased plant growth all over the world.Any facility that pumps liquids, involves rotating machinery and produces or uses electricity must be maintained. Parts that wear out are replaced, newer versions are installed. A nuclear generator could easily be operational for many decades with programmed maintenance, as they are today. Licensing them for a specific time period flies in the face of reality. Homeowners dont walk away from a house with a worn out washing machine, plumbing problems or a leaky roof, they fix them.When innovators interfere by discovering cost-effective approaches, first you find some troubling concern with their technology, and if that fails, discover that the risk was worse than we thought and adjust the regulatory limits down to half of what the new technology can achieve.STILL repeating the same old -same old from the 1940s  mankind does _not_learn very fast. We really need some new thinkers on the scene, but I ask you, who or how or WHERE will the mold (mould for Brits) be broken? Universities teach the same staid approach that has us in the present quagmire thinking/implementations that have not progressed since the 1940s . we are truly STUCK since big science will ONLY fund what big sci has FUNDED before. NO new thinking/presentation of theory (esp at a low level concerning even the electron and its relationship to the nucleus) is allowed.You couldnt be more wrong. Big science is an arm of government, the impetus for carbon sequestration, hydrogen combustion, solar power and wind farms, all experiments that are subsidized by taxes or enpixelated funds.Enpixelated funds are monetary units created by keystrokes without going through mining and minting or even printing. They are abstractions and do not exist in the observable world yet are accepted as payment for debts. Many businesses do not accept real money, only enpixelated funds, despite the phrase on fiat paper federal reserve notes, this note is legal tender for all debts, public and private, Of course these businesses should be shunned by all but internet commerce requires enpixelated funds and their convenience ensnares the modern who regards the pre-digital era as a hopeless social and economic antique of the past.Fiat currency is what I would call an unreliable store of value. It is real money because it is fungible and accepted as legal tender in most scenarios. Its unreliable because it is easily and persistently debased.Its a real word if someone uses it and others understand it. Most people would probably figure it out if they thought about it a little. Gold or silver has a value anywhere and always has. US Confederate notes, Wiemar German bills and Zimbabwean notes are valueless except as curiosities. Gold coins were used by the Romans to pay their troops because they were accepted everywhere and those troops were stationed all over the Empire. Before and after the American revolution almost any gold or silver coins were accepted in trade as well as coins from the UK.Im just saying that all forms of money depend on supply and demand setting the price of the money.  Gold is useful as money because it is rare, it doesnt corrode, and the quantity mined annually is small compared to the total amount already in circulation. It is very difficult to create new supplies of gold. Therefore it can be a relatively stable store of value.The true value of money is tied to the goods and services produced in an economy. While you may consider gold a good when used to make jewelry, in the form of bullion it has no useful function other than to be a stable store of value. People agree to accept it in exchange for goods and services because they know that nobody can create new gold to debase its value and they know that everybody else accepts it as payment.The value we talk about is really how many goods and services can be obtained with the exchange of a certain weight of gold. If two starving people were in a village where one had a piece of bread and the other had a bar of gold, both people would want the bread, and the gold would be worthless.The real price of money is how many useful goods and services you need to supply to receive a unit of currency, how many loaves of bread or hours of labor do you need to get a gold coin?  If there is too much money chasing the same goods and services, there will be price inflation. The same unit of currency buys less.if there was a massive meteorite of pure gold that increased the worlds gold supply by 20%, that would depress the price of gold, the same as if a government suddenly added 20% to the supply of fiat currency. Of course thats highly unlikely to happen.Funding research is paying for effort irrespective of results. Effort that private companies wont fund because the probability of technical or commercial success or the cost-benefit analysis makes no sense.Researchers are people. Why struggle with a difficult problem for 70-80 hrs/week when you get no more pay than if you plod along or even slack off?  If they are getting paid a secure salary regardless of whether they succeed or fail, some of them spend their 40 hours browsing porn, or commenting on X.Im not saying that it is never in the national interest to invest in basic research. What I am saying is that when the research aims toward a practical application, there must be powerful incentives to achieve the goal.If you want a bunch of functioning frantabulators, its probably far more effective for the government to promise to buy the first working prototype for whatever had been contemplated as the cost of research grants, and to buy the first x frantabulators delivered by any maker on a decreasing pricing scale. That is how you incentivize timely results and remove commercial risk.Subsidies are not what is needed. End all the frivolous lawsuits is what is needed. As soon as they file one arrest ALL involved for insurrection, lock their asses in rundown DC jail and then wait 3 years to give them trials.Grandpas and grandmas taking selfies, and FBI + AntiFa agitators,  and no guns , hardly constitutes an attempt to overthrow the government.   Why did Speaker Pelosi refuse additional manpower for security?And tell me, why was the J6 riot allowed to happen? The Capital Police knew there was going to be trouble, so did the FBI. Trump asked for 20,000 National Guardsmen to assist with crowd and riot control. Why was that not granted?Nobody said Trump signed an order.  He offered the troops to Pelosi, and she turned them down.  If Trump was half the dictator the socialists claim he is, he would have just overrode Pelosi and sent the troops anyway.I am of two minds on this. Ignoring troll-bots like Lusername might allow its mind-numbed nonsense to go unchallenged. On the other hand, its probably best if instead of acknowledging its nonsense we  just down-vote and in a separate comment make the case for the realist point of view just once, refusing to engage in a back-and-forth with a robot.I worked on the cancelled Summer 2/3 project in South Carolina. It wasnt frivolous lawsuits that killed the project. It was Westinghouse incompetence that made a predictable construction schedule impossible and caused costs to spiral out of control. The sister project in Georgia was able to survive because they were a bigger company and took the federal loan guarantees.In that case, what was supposed to be a $10 billion project ended up around $30 billion.Until a reactor vendor comes up with a design and builds the prototype on a predictable schedule at a competitive cost and shows that it can be operated reliably and economically, no one in their right mind will risk their money on it.Until a reactor vendor comes up with a design and builds the prototype on a predictable schedule at a competitive cost and shows that it can be operated reliably and economically, no one in their right mind will risk their money on it.  Yes, and with the endless stream of frivolous lawsuits against nuclear industry when will that happen? Hell, DoE, DoJ and BLM/DoI are participating in the dog pile of frivolous crap.Who on Earth came up with the idea, let alone signed it off?  In short, it is the pride flag applied to the Cross of St. George and it isnt inclusive, its an insult. If a nations flag doesnt include someone, then, that someone has a problem all their own.No strat, youre wrong. Since 1707 the national flag of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland has been the Union jack or flag. The cross of St. George, the Welsh dragon flag and the cross of St. Andrew (or saltire) are not national flags but can be (and have been) used as unofficial flags of national identity and thats fine. But what it is not is the national flag of England, ok?I suppose that the antiquated thinking would refer to identifying as British. I must confess that I dont understand the nuance there. I am a Connecticutian, a New Englander, a US citizen, an American, and a Terran. Being from Connecticut doesnt override my American-ness.So thats why Microsoft is hiring nuclear engineers, eh chumly. Your sad tears will be mocked when your woke corporate masters start building a lot of nuke plants. Even if they are woke like you they are not stupid and realize unreliables cant run their cash cow cloud business data centers. Even a caveman can see it.Entering a market with new SMR technology where wind and solar has a huge political constituency built on receiving tax credits and other incentives worth $100s of billions presents a challenge for the inevitable nuclear renaissance. The only question is how long we want to keep pretending that sunshine and breezes can power a modern society.Seems to be many new nuclear job postings by G&Ts with nuclear in their portfolios.  Graybeards in the industry will likely have the opportunity to make lots of money.  Hopefully there are enough around to pass on their knowledge and expertise to the next generation.Using the Levelized Full System Costs of Electricity (LFSCOE) comparison method, wind plus infrastructure plus battery storage are over twice the cost of an equivalent nuclear power plant. Solar plus battery storage is over 3 times more expensive.Yet our politicians pursue a strategy of HOPE that some magical fairy dust will drop battery and transmission line costs down to virtually nothing or hydrogen electrolysis, a technology known for over 230 years but still 10 times more expensive that natural gas on a heat equivalent basis, will make their current generation preferences cost effective.Captain, As you state, our politicians pursue a strategy of HOPE that some magical fairy dust will drop battery and transmission line costs down to virtually nothing. Actually, if the batteries were free grid scale battery storage for more than four (4) hours would still be too expensive; as I suspect you fully understand. The associated packet cost for enclosure, overcurrent protection, switchgear, fire suppression and more costs $200/KWh of the $500+total packet.There is plenty of Hydrocarbon fuel in the world to wait for the new energy tech that will truly demand destruct the Hydrocarbon markets. Classic nuke power is very expensive old tech. Do your homework on the capital costs and subsidy costs of nuke power.I can see nuke power application in areas where there isnt a ample supply of natural gas pipelines but wholesale tax subsidized transition to nuke power is unnecessary and capital costs make it more expensive than multi-tiered NG powered generation.If it aint broken dont fix it.  In the long run, the nuke power noise will be quenched by the rad environmentalists and the Big energy arm into Washington.  There will be no major transition to nuke power.If the GOP wants to do good, make the hydrocarbon fuel markets free of collusion and ensure that emerging tech like ambient SC, fusion do not get suppressed. Stop our politicians from being leveraged to make people pay through the nose for hydrocarbon fuel and stop with this nuke non-sense.In 50 years or less the hydrocarbon market question will be moot due to emerging tech that will demand destroy the market. Isnt this the crux of the issue now anyway.. By then it will be something else like under population and transition to anti-human economy.The current political goal is not to end the hydrocarbon fuel markets. it is to leverage them and maintain the cash cow while wielding the propaganda weapon to instigate a dystopic anti-human world view that will lead significant depopulation in the 50 year interimthat is to ensure that we continue to consume and pay through the nose as we age out and disappear.Thats the funny thing about Emergent Technologies that are at least 50 years down the road, they havent emerged yet and cant be predicted. This is the same trap that the idiots pushing Wind and Solar as well as Lithium batteries have fallen into  lets go with this, a miracle will occur, then itll all be rosy. No miracle has occurred in the last 50 years so what makes you think itll happen in the next 50?Agree, cost benefit analysis has become an big moving target in the past 4-5 years on the internet. My reading indicates the the capital costs 14 times greater than NG fired plants  putting the cost benefit win on the multi-tier NG electrical generation not nuke. This is especially true we there is a good supply distribution of NG which is a good chunk of the USA..  So it makes no sense to replace existing NG plants with nuke plants.What we need is CNG cars not EVs. EVs with the tax subsidy are crazy expensive. think about the impact of all that taxpayer money going down the drain for Lithium batteries that are useless in 10 years or less.  The people who are pushing for nuke and EVs are an economic wrecking crew.Taxpayer subsidized items like humungous sports stadiums are tech as old as Imperial Rome but still go up on a regular basis in Yankeeland and other wealthy neighborhoods. These expensive monstrosities are actually just big television studios but television itself is old tech, depending on your technological time line. The Nautilus was launched in 1954 but were unaware of improvements to its nuclear propulsion system in the 70 years since, if any, because of paranoid secrecy.Which leads to the issue of nuclear generation construction cost, a significant part of which is hardening the facility against an attack. Nuclear plants are engineered to make them as impervious to a suicidal aircraft or bomb as possible, since the success of the US is deemed to make every significant technological technique it embraces a target of barbarian hordes whose jealousy inspires destruction.Tax subsidies for nuke power are pointless and backwards. Nuke is zero gain over fossil fuel. In the same way renewables are a negative gain compared to multi- tiered natural gas electrical generation.  This is true for a simple reason; natural gas if the cheaper option.  This is true even in the era of global hydrocarbon glut and massive global hydrocarbon fuel collusion artificially propping up fuel prices leveraging war and the climate change hysteria.  I think many people on WUWT think the political movement of climate change and global press of hydrocarbon fuel prices would be solved by nuke it wont be.  It is a political problem not a tech problem.  The rad environmentalists who are covertly funding much of the climate change propaganda have a bigger agenda than the world existing hydrocarbon fuel.  They want greater centralization of power and they will leverage everything to achieve it including partnering sideways with the darlings of Davos Big Oil to achieve it.  Frack On!  These are the same people who have built their massive careers generating consumer tech that we paid and invested in with our IRA and 401Ks..which enabled the massive centralization of information, discourse and markets.The question of tech that has been emerging since 1966  (Ambient SC, cold fusion Solar, SC electrical generation, AI Quantum computing, SC motors, fuel Cells, AI, Internet, Flat Screen TVs. Cell phones, person computers etc.). All this emerging tech was conceptualized in the 1960s and early 70s.anyone hanging out at Cal Tech and MIT would have heard the dreamers working up prototypes and conceptualizing a new world with new tech. And if you were hanging out at some of the top law schools you would have heard about the coming threat to human privacy and other threats to democracy empowered by coming socially integrated computer systems. The fear what that these new systems would threaten representative power via greater and greater centralization of discourse, information, distribution of good and services and markets.I lived in the vortex of these developments in D.C. in those days. My Father being a top systems analyst and cold warrior and my friends at MIT and Georgetown, UVA, and  Georgia, law and John Hopkins computer labs and me working as a research assistant.What caught the imagination of investors was consumer tech because of its power and potential to penetrate personally into the lives of everyone globally creating enormous efficiencies and wealth. A massive revolution of consumers paying for consumable (non-capital) tech creating the capital for global centralization of information, discourse and markets  Remember, we bought the products and provide the data which provided the capital for the systems we have today.double cash for the Tech world.What didnt capture the imagination of investors or government subsidies is emerging energy infrastructure tech .. .except solar, which is useless without viable affordable ambient SCMCS. Additionally, fusion is also being dependent on viable affordable ambient SC.So the lynch pin for truly innovative energy infrastructure tech for highly efficient electrical generation and distribution and eventually fusion got lost in the shuffle or suppressed. This is the lynch pin that would have significantly demand destructed the hydrocarbon fuel markets and weakened the global currency of oil as a weapon of powerEven this past summer we saw the science media completely destroy a purported ambient superconductor LK-99 in 2-3 weeks. How is this science? Since then, there have been glimmers of hope for LK-99 that you have to search high and low for or manipulate a AI chat system to reveal. LOL which is fun BTW.Is this the environment that a new Ambient SC will emerge. heck no.  It doesnt matter if LK-99 was a total goof. The message is clear to anyone doing this researchwatch your step or you will be crushed. Compare this to the endless bogus climate propagandized science the science media puts out the same journals that crushed LK-99 in 3 weeks. Read between the lines and you get my point.ToldYouSo, hasnt anyone told you that yes, nuclear requires materials of construction, but it is less mineral intensive by orders of magnitude at >90% capacity factor and 60-year life cycle vs solar at a<30% CF and 30-year lifecycle? What about battery storage forever being too expensive for more than four (4) hours? No one ever told you about that either?High-level nuclear waste consists largely of spent fuel from nuclear reactors. Though it makes up a small proportion of overall waste volumes, it accounts for the majority of radioactivity. This most potent form of nuclear waste, according to some, needs to be safely stored for up to a million years. Yes, 1 million years  in other words, a far longer stretch of time than the period since Neanderthals cropped up. This is an estimate of the length of time needed to ensure radioactive decay.And nobody has yet given a satisfactory answer to the question of what to do with thousands of metric tonnes of high-level nuclear waste, some of which can remain radioactive, and thereby lethal, for up to 300,000 years. Nowhere in the world has anyone managed to create a place where we can bury extremely nasty nuclear waste forever, says Denis Florin, partner at Lavoisier Conseil, an energy-focused management consultancy in Paris. We cannot go on using nuclear without being adult about the waste, without accepting we need to find a permanent solution.As discussed in the referenced article, France, like all other countries with commercial scale nuclear power plants, is just kicking the can down the road when it comes with how to handle and eventually store/dispose of high level nuclear waste from such reactors.In a process pioneered by France, many of the uranium, plutonium and fission chemicals have been reprocessed into new fuel at the La Hague site, while waste chemicals that cannot be reused have been vitrified, or turned into glass, for short-term storage in shallow sites underground.Well no it doesnt does it? The spent fuel rods are no longer waste after reprocessing so the amount of waste to be dealt with is vastly reduced, not increased. There will always be something that needs to be disposed of with nuclear fission but reprocessing is a way of reducing that waste by a considerable amount as well as reducing the amount of raw fuel that needs to be mined. More efficient.Uhhhh . . . I believe the statement in the Financial Times article I linked about the process itself creates yet more radioactive waste refers to the fact that, in the reprocessing of spent fuel rods, a portion of the reprocessing facility itself (e.g., plumbing, containment vessels, rod handling equipment, storage drums, etc.) becomes radioactive, known as induced radioactivity.  Also, the more radioactive waste certainly includes the chemical waste stream of fluids used in in cutting operations to open the sealed fuel rods and in chemically separating the various isotopes contained therein.Radioisotopes with short half-lives are dangerous for the straightforward reason that they can dose you very heavily (and fatally) in a short time. Such isotopes have been the main causes of radiation poisoning and death after above-ground explosions of nuclear weapons . . .Long-term isotopes are more complicated. They dont dose as heavily, but there are a lot more issues than just that. Plutonium for example is comparatively long-lived, but some of its decay products can be quite nasty . . .The biggest danger from radioisotopes with mid-to-long half lives is that they can keep an entire region of earth nastily radioactive for a very long time, e.g. hundreds or thousands or even tens of thousand of years. Thats the main reason why disposing of reactor wastes, which often contain just such isotopes, is such a contentious issue.Those nukes have cooling towers which emit huge plumes of dihydrogen monoxide. Dihydrogen monoxide is the most powerful greenhouse gas. And it kills 4000 people every year in the U.S. and thousands more worldwide. So maybe we should ban it?The base line of liability for any incorporated business is the capital of the corporation. Once the capital is exhausted, claims cannot be paid. So, if claims exceeded the capital of the utility, it could file a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding in Federal court and the claimants would be paid a prorata portion of their claims. Ex-hypotheis, the utilitys assets were destroyed in the incident and its capital would therefor be severely impaired.PAA addressed this problem by imposing on nuclear plant operators an obligation to purchase liability insurance. It allowed the creation of an entity, n/k/a American Nuclear Insurers, which is a pool of large domestic property-casualty insurance and reinsurance companies, to sell the coverage. The required insurance is now $450 million.But, wait there is more. If the damages exceed $450 million, every licensed nuclear plant operator is required to contribute to a fund to pay those claims up to $131 million. The total amount of these contributions is currently about $12.9 billion. There is an additional required surcharge if those funds are depleted of up to 5% of the original contribution. The act provides for federal court jurisdiction to prioritize payments.Does the act protect the utility companies? Not really. They are protected by their corporate charters. No, it protects the rate payers from being forced to pay extra to replenish the utilitys capital so that it can stay in business. It also creates an industry funded mechanism for paying claims promptly and fulsomely.So, where is the subsidy? There isnt any. The Act makes the industry pay for insurance.The Federal Government is not required to pay anything. https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/nuclear-insurance.htmlNumber two, list the energy sources that are affordable, constant and accessible. Do wind and solar meet any of those requirements? No. Do fossil fuels meet those requirements? Yes. Does nuclear meet those requirements? Yes.It has been a long time since I did the reading but if I recall properly, the Price-Anderson Act has never cost US taxpayers a single penny. It is a Federal Government guarantee demanded by the insurance and finance sectors to limit their costs in case of a major nuclear plant disaster which has never happened. Calling it a subsidy is a convoluted though process although I suppose, if the extremely unlikely ever did happen, it might involve some taxpayer costs, depending on which way the politicians jumped.Nuclear waste storage is a red herring in any rational world. Again, based of earlier reading, the type of reactor normally built in the US, perhaps all of US reactors, use less than 1% of the energy in the fuel rods. According to theory, there are design that can use about 99%, producing very little waste.The leftover stuff could be very valuable in itself for other uses with some processing but I dont know if the processing costs for most of that would be economicalThere are physical difficulties with the design of such reactors, such as materials that can stand up to corrosion well enough to make the designs viable, but the potential is there if there could be enough interest to do the necessary material research (perfect first, build reactors after).Also, some other countries are not hobbled with the same stupidity as US regulations. They reprocess the used fuel, considerably reducing the waste to begin with. As above, this waste can be valuable in itself as a source of radioactive materials that have uses in industry and medicine, as well as for atomic batteries in locations needing moderate power for long periods without human intervention or maintenance.
risk,The European Investment Bank (EIB) dealt a major blow to the nuclear industry at last weeks International Nuclear Energy Summit in Brussels, when it dithered over the industrys request for more funding for nuclear projects, but confirmed that investment in renewable energy will remain a priority until 2030.What would it take for nuclear energy to make a substantial contribution to our climate neutrality target? I see a number of key challenges. The most important is to secure new investment, said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at the Nuclear Energy Summit (NES) in Brussels on Thursday (21 March).This statement set the scene for the major international conference, where some 40 official delegations attended, including those from China, India, and the United States, along with more than 300 industry leaders. All of whom had come to request more certainty on financing for nuclear power.We call for greater integration of nuclear energy into the environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies of the international financial system, they wrote in a joint statement adopted at the event.But some are politically hesitant, not necessarily in favour of nuclear energy, said the French presidents office, before the summit, particularly the European Investment Bank (EIB). Who did not hesitate to repeat their hesitancy during the event leaving many guests speechless.By comparison, the EIB has lent more than 10 billion for renewable energy investments in 2021 alone  a trend is set to continue as renewable energy will be our priority until 2030, said EIB Vice-President Thomas stros at last weeks summit.Faudon also described stross speech as worrying, though, she acknowledged that some progress had been made in this area, as not so long ago, everyone in Brussels thought it was perfectly normal to say that we only deal with renewables, she told Euractiv.In the past, potential developers were discouraged, so to speak, from applying [for EIB funding], said Yves Desbazeilles, director general of Nucleareurope, the association representing the nuclear industry to the EU.This was the case, for example, with the financing of the Hinkley Point C nuclear reactors in England, he told Euractiv at a press briefing on Friday (22 March). According to Desbazeilles, the problem was that It seemed cumbersome and politically difficult.Frances EDF has recently come under fire for increasing project costs and delays, while problems with its existing fleet of reactors have resurfaced. Euractiv looks at what this means for the state-owned energy giant as the industry appears to be in full swing.At the same time, the European Commission, responsible for providing an opinion on any EIB financing, seems more inclined than before to welcome a nuclear project, especially Small Modular Reactors (SMRs).Pressure on the EIBs management is mounting after the French-led Nuclear Alliances call in early March, to open up European financing for nuclear power.This was reiterated, by 12 EU countries on the sidelines of the Nuclear Energy Summit on Thursday.As EIB investment decisions require the approval of all EU member states, the only thing left to do is to urge member states that are strongly opposed to nuclear power, such as Germany and Austria, to change their mindset, Andrei Goicea, head of public policy at Nucleareurope, told Euractiv on Friday.Nuclear technologies should benefit from all types of EU funding, such as the European Investment Bank (EIB) and innovation funds, the French-led nuclear alliance, which now has 12 EU member states, said at its meeting on Monday.
risk,John Gorton, who was prime minister from 1968 to 1971, was a true believer in nuclear. His biographer Ian Hancock wrote that Gorton "visualised the generation of cheap electricity, and fuel for transport of all kinds"."We shall, during the next parliament, take Australia into the atomic age by beginning the construction of an atomic plant at Jervis Bay [on the NSW south coast], to generate electricity. We believe that Australia will make increasing use of atomic power in the years ahead and that the time for this nation to enter the atomic age has now arrived."Plans were well underway when in 1971 Gorton lost the prime ministership to Billy McMahon, a critic of the Jervis Bay project, which was put into limbo. Treasury did an evaluation that  you've guessed it  slammed the cost; a journalist at the time described it as "a most devastating critique". The way was opened for coal, which was much more economically viable for Australia's power generation. The Jervis Bay project was dead.Peter Dutton is a very different brand of Liberal from the freewheeling, often undisciplined Gorton, but he has become as convinced as his predecessor about the nuclear path. And, just as in Gorton's time, the critics cite cost. Only now the cost issue is about renewables versus nuclear.It seems an odd choice as the year's first big policy hit  nuclear power isn't dominating kitchen table discussions around the country. Leaving that aside, the release will be a major test for Dutton, in handling both the economics and the politics of the ensuing debate.He starts with most energy experts ranged against him. He's obviously not himself an expert, so being convincing when he has to get into the fine detail won't be easy. Public attitudes towards nuclear may have softened, but if he flounders in defending the economic case, he'll have lost the argument even before the politics kick in.One aspect of the evolution of the opposition's nuclear policy that raises an eyebrow is how it has so quickly transitioned from concentrating on small modular reactors  which spokesman Ted O'Brien spruiked enthusiastically but most experts dismissed as impractical  to being centred on conventional reactors. It might have been a sensible move, but it makes you wonder whether the policy crafters were on top of the complexities to start with.The opposition hopes its plan to place the reactors (about half a dozen) only on or near the sites of coal-fired power stations as they phase out will limit the effectiveness of Labor's scare assault. It will then become a matter of persuading the affected local communities, and Dutton has flagged incentives.More generally, the opposition aims to persuade regional voters that nuclear is better than having their areas covered with power lines and wind farms that many find ugly and intrusive. This would probably resonate in many areas, provided Dutton could allay other doubts with these voters, such as about cost.The cities will be another matter. In teal and similar seats, a strong commitment to renewables is likely to make voters unsympathetic to the nuclear case. The opposition may not have great hopes of winning back the teal electorates, but it will be aware of the risk of losing more seats to teal candidates and so it has to be careful.In outer suburbia, Dutton's target territory, the danger for him is that voters see nuclear power as a side issue. Yes, they will hear his claim it would mean lower power prices but, even if they buy that very contested argument, they'll know that would be far into the future.Hard-pressed families are interested in the here and now. And that goes to a broader problem for Dutton's nuclear campaign. It could lead up a dry gully, a debate that consumes time and effort better spent on more central cost-of-living and other issues.Dutton says the opposition won't be a small target at the election. Even if that's sound thinking, he needs to have reasonable confidence that "big target" policies will carry a more than 50-50 chance of paying significant dividends. He doesn't have much political capital to spend. The likely dividend from the nuclear policy could easily be a net negative.The energy minister has rubbished his shadow counterpart's claims Australia could have nuclear power plants up and running in 10 years as the Coalition prepares to announce the nuclear plan it will take to the next election.Dutton might be a nuclear believer but his stand also has to be understood in a Coalition context. His most important priority since the election has been keeping unity in the opposition's ranks. He has managed this but it is always potentially precarious.The Nationals have been bugbears for Liberal leaders on energy policy. Currently the party is divided between those who support the 2050 net zero emissions target (including leader David Littleproud) and the radical outliers who'd like to ditch the commitment to the target, which the party only signed up to under duress in the run-up to the last election.

risk,The Biden administration and dozens of other countries have pledged to triple the capacity of nuclear power worldwide in their battle against climate change, ensuring uranium will remain a key commodity for decades as the government offers incentives for developing the next generation of nuclear reactors and new policies take aim at Russia's influence over the supply chain.But as the U.S. pursues its nuclear power potential, environmentalists and Native American leaders remain fearful of the consequences for communities near mining and milling sites in the West and are demanding better regulatory oversight.Producers say uranium production today is different than decades ago when the country was racing to build up its nuclear arsenal. Those efforts during World War II and the Cold War left a legacy of death, disease and contamination on the Navajo Nation and in other communities across the country, making any new development of the ore a hard pill to swallow for many.The new mining at Pinyon Plain Mine near the Grand Canyon's South Rim entrance is happening within the boundaries of the Baaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukv National Monument that was designated in August by President Joe Biden. The work was allowed to move forward since Energy Fuels Inc. had valid existing rights.The mine will cover only 17 acres (6.8 hectares) and will operate for three to six years, producing at least 2 million pounds (about 907,000 kilograms) of uranium  enough to power the state of Arizona for at least a year with carbon-free electricity, he said.Energy Fuels, which also is prepping two more mines in Colorado and Wyoming, has produced about two-thirds of the uranium in the U.S. in the last five years. In 2022, it was awarded a contract to sell $18.5 million in uranium concentrates to the U.S. government to help establish the nation's strategic reserve for when supplies might be disrupted.Amid the growing appetite for uranium, a coalition of Native Americans testified before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in late February, asking the panel to pressure the U.S. government to overhaul outdated mining laws and prevent further exploitation of marginalized communities.Carletta Tilousi, who served for years on the Havasupai Tribal Council, said she and others have written countless letters to state and federal agencies and sat through hours of meetings with regulators and lawmakers. Her tribe's reservation lies in a gorge off the Grand Canyon.A group of hydrology and geology professors and nuclear watchdogs sent Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs a letter in January, asking she reconsider permits granted by state environmental regulators that cleared the way for the mine. She has yet to respond and her office declined to answer questions from The Associated Press.Lawyers for Energy Fuels said in a letter to state officials that reopening the permits would be an improper attempt to side step Arizona's administrative procedures and rights protecting permit holders from ''such politicized actions.''The environmentalists' request followed a plea weeks earlier by the Havasupai saying mining at the foot of Red Butte will compromise one of the tribe's most sacred spots. Called Wii'i Gdwiisa by the Havasupai, the landmark is central to tribal creation stories and also holds significance for the Hopi, Navajo and Zuni people.''It is with heavy hearts that we must acknowledge that our greatest fear has come true,'' the Havasupai said in a January statement, reflecting on concerns that mining could affect water supplies, wildlife, plants and geology throughout the Colorado Plateau.The U.S. Geological Survey recently partnered with the Havasupai Tribe to examine contamination possibilities that could include exposure through inhalation and ingestion of traditional food and medicines, processing animal hides or absorption through materials collected for face and body painting.Legal challenges aimed at stopping the Pinyon Plain Mine repeatedly have been rejected by the courts, and top officials in the Biden administration are reticent to weigh in beyond speaking generally about efforts to improve consultation with Native American tribes.It marks another front in an ongoing battle over energy development and sacred lands, as tribes in Nevada and Arizona are fighting the federal government over the mining of lithium and the siting of renewable energy transmission lines.The Pinyon Plain Mine, formerly known as the Canyon Mine, was permitted in 1984. Because it retained existing rights, the mine effectively became grandfathered into legal operation despite a 20-year moratorium placed on uranium mining in the Grand Canyon region by the Obama administration in 2012.The U.S. Forest Service in 2012 reaffirmed an environmental impact statement that had been prepared for the mine years earlier, and state regulators signed off on air and aquifer protection permitting within the past two years.Environmental reviews conducted as part of the permitting process have concluded the mine's operation won't affect visitors to the national park, area residents or groundwater or springs associated with the park. Still, environmentalists say the mine raises a bigger question about the Biden administration's willingness to adopt policies favorable of nuclear power.The U.S. Commerce Department under the Trump administration issued a 2019 report describing domestic production as essential to national security, citing the need to maintain the nuclear arsenal and keep commercial nuclear reactors fueled to generate electricity. At that point, nuclear reactors supplied nearly 20% of the electricity consumed in the U.S.The Biden administration is staying the course. It's in the midst of a multibillion-dollar modernization of the nation's nuclear defense capabilities, and the U.S. Energy Department on Wednesday offered a $1.5 billion loan to the owners of a Michigan power plant to restart the shuttered facility, which would mark a first in the U.S.Taylor McKinnon, the Center for Biological Diversity's Southwest director, said pushing for more nuclear power and allowing mining near the Grand Canyon ''makes a mockery of the administration's environmental justice rhetoric."Using nuclear power to reach emissions goals is a hard sell in the western U.S. From the Navajo Nation to Ute Mountain Ute and Oglala Lakota homelands, tribal communities have deep-seated distrust of uranium companies and the federal government as abandoned mines and related contamination have yet to be cleaned up.A complex of mines on the Navajo Nation recently was added to the federal Superfund list. The eastern edge of the reservation also is home to the largest radioactive accident in U.S. history. In 1979, more than 93 million gallons (350 million liters) of radioactive and acidic slurry spilled from a tailings disposal pond, contaminating water supplies, livestock and downstream communities. It was three times the radiation released at the Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania just three months earlier.Teracita Keyanna with the Red Water Pond Road Community Association got choked up while testifying before the human rights commission in Washington, D.C., saying federal regulators proposed keeping contaminated soil onsite rather than removing it.''It's really unfair that we have to deal with this and my children have to deal with this and later on, my grandchildren have to deal with this,'' she said. ''Why is the government just feeling like we're disposable. We're not.''Congresswoman Cori Bush of Missouri said during a congressional meeting in January that lawmakers can't talk about expanding nuclear energy in the U.S. without first dealing with the effects that nuclear waste has had on minority communities. Bush pointed to her own district in St. Louis, where waste was left behind from the uranium refining required by the top-secret Manhattan Project.
risk,The Coalitions solution to the climate crisis is set to be unveiled, with Peter Dutton reportedly planning to announce sites for a number of nuclear power stations, which would necessarily involve lifting Australias long-standing ban on nuclear power.While the Coalitions policy has been rubbished as misinformed bulldust by the likes of Andrew Forrest, a dumb idea by experts and hot air by the energy minister, the News Corp papers have been at the forefront of nuclear advocacy.In the past month, The Australian has published a number of articles on nuclear power, with only one of its many op-eds (the aforementioned hot air piece by Energy Minister Chris Bowen) arguing in favour of Australias ban on nuclear.Dutton is right to develop a net-zero plan that includes nuclear, the piece continued. Refusing to lift the ban or even consider the issue  makes the federal government look out of touch with what is happening in the modern energy world.Crikey asked The Australians managing editor Darren Davidson on March 5 whether the paper had an editorial view on the merits of nuclear energy, and how it balanced any view it may have with the Coalitions policy position, as well as any ethical obligations that may arise in its reportage. He declined to comment.This mornings editorial comes on the heels of one published on February 17 headlined Nuclear option made easy by the renewables miscue. It went on to describe nuclear power as a logical option for emissions-free power, a sensible option, but admitted it was incendiary politics.Political editor Simon Benson has been responsible for much of this nuclear coverage, penning an op-ed on February 25 that argued the Labor government was at risk of ending up on the wrong side of history in its fanatical opposition to nuclear power.Benson was also responsible for an exclusive, also published on February 25, that showed Newspoll data conducted for The Australian that showed 55% of Australian voters supported the idea of small modular nuclear reactors as a replacement technology for coal-fired power.The Australian has also ran a number of opinion pieces over the past month in favour of the Coalitions policy, including one by Peta Credlin headlined: Liberal true believers stand firm against false net-zero gospel.However the paper also ran a piece by Sarah Ison on February 16 that highlighted one of the limits of the introduction of nuclear power in Australia. Ison interviewed Australian Industry Group climate change director Tennant Reed, who said that Australia may be waiting for more than 20 years for economically viable nuclear power.Are you among the 55% of Australians who apparently support the idea of small modular nuclear reactors as a replacement for coal power?

risk,Shortly after the magnitude-9 earthquake struck on March 11, a series of tsunamis inundated four of the reactor buildings and set off a chain reaction in three reactors that resulted in the release of significant amounts of radioactivity into the environment.The challenge in recent years has been to gather the large amounts of nuclear fuel that escaped from the reactors in order to halt the release of more radiation something that had never been attempted before and has to be carried out in buildings where radioactive contamination remains dangerously elevated and where debris from the tsunami and subsequent hydrogen explosions still litters the area.Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO), the operator of the plant, has estimated that work to make the plant safe will take between 30 and 40 years, but recent reports on progress at the site have been largely negative.In January, TEPCO announced that it would have to delay plans to commence in March the test use of a robotic arm to remove radioactive material from the No. 2 reactor. The initial plan called for tests using the robotic limb to take place in 2021 but were delayed by technical glitches.Other areas of the project have also experienced challenges, with the first drones and a robot sent into the No. 1 reactor building earlier this month also suffering faults. The drones and robothad to be withdrawn before they could complete their mission to locate molten fuel debris that has leaked from the reactor and to map other damage."Based on the roadmap and the Nuclear Regulation Authority's 'Risk Map,'the decommissioning steps to be taken over the next 10 years have been compiled in the mid-and-long term decommissioning action plan, which is periodically revised in light of decommissioning progress and the emergence of new issues that need to be addressed,"TEPCO said.The company is also keen to point out its achievements, including the complete removal of spent nuclear fuel from units three and four at the site, a sharp reduction in the amount of water seeping into the chambers beneath the reactors and becoming contaminated with radiation as well as the successful treatment of radioactive water below according to standards set by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) before it is released into the Pacific Ocean.Vincent Gorgues, the chief of staff to the French High Commissioner for Nuclear Energy and presently one of three international special advisors to Japan's Nuclear Damage Compensation and Decommissioning Facilitation Corp, told DW that progress to date has been overwhelmingly positive, despite the countless challenges."Nuclear projects are complex,"he said. "Among them, decommissioning projects are highly singular and offer a higher level of difficulty, due mainly to the level of uncertainty about the initial state of the facility and to difficulties in managing safely all the radioactive waste streams.""Even today, access to the reactor buildings is very difficult and requires fully remotely operated means of intervention, while carrying out investigations and having a precise idea of what needs to be done, even before considering how to do it, is a huge challenge in itself,"Gorgues said.In addition, each of the three crippled reactors has its own set of specific challenges and there is no disposal site for the highly radioactive nuclear waste that must be recovered from the site, he pointed out.The key steps now are to remove all the spent nuclear fuel, whether intact or leaked, from inside reactor buildings one and two, and the retrieval and disposal of fuel debris from the partial core meltdowns.Gorgues said he favors speeding up the release of treated water from the plant in order to dismantle the hundreds of storage tanks that presently occupy much of the site, with that land needed for new waste treatment and storage facilities.The expert also played down suggestions that TEPCO would likely not be able to stick to its declared timeline for the decommissioning process, emphasizing that the three- or four-decade schedule is "a target"rather than a deadline."This is not a race, but a structured, careful,stepwise approach, which at every stage requires you to take time, determine the best strategy and guarantee both short-term and long-term safety,"Gorgues said, adding that the radiological conditions "are extremely hostile.""This indicative timeframe of 30 to 40 years had two communication goals: to show that it would take a long time; but also to show that the timeframe would remain commensurable with one professional career and that the burden would not be passed on over several generations. It is in that spirit that we must consider this target.""I would like to stress, however, that these delays have remained minor and that most of what was announced has been achieved,"he said. "In my opinion, and under these conditions, what has already been done is a remarkable achievement."

The effort has partially disrupted Russian gasoline supplies, and driven domestic prices higher.Fears that disrupted Russian oil prices could ripple through global markets prompted U.S. officials to quietly urge Ukraine to halt attacks on Russias energy infrastructure, the Financial Times reported March 22.A Russian court on April 3 rejected an appeal filed by a 17-year-old against a six-year prison term he was handed in November for throwing Molotov cocktails at recruitment centers in St. Petersburg and Kirovsk to protest Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The airline said on April 3 that the suspension of flights to and from Kazan would come into effect on April 5 and that it was being done "for security reasons." The announcement came a day after a drone attack targeted Tatarstan's industrial facilities in Yelabuga and Nizhnekamsk, injuring 14 people, including foreigners from eight nations, in what appeared to be the deepest such strike inside Russia by Ukrainian armed forces fighting against Russia's ongoing invasion launched in February 2022. Kyiv has not officially claimed responsibility for the attack.Ukraine's fifth president, Petro Poroshenko, told Al-Jazeera television on April 2 that he plans to run for president again after Russia's ongoing invasion of his country is over. Poroshenko also said that, if Ukraine becomes an EU member, he is ready to run for the European Parliament. The presidential election in Ukraine scheduled for March 2024 was postponed indefinitely because of Russia's aggression against its neighbor. Poroshenko served as Ukraine's president in 2014-2019.

The legislation also introduces wide oversight powers by the authorities and potential criminal sanctions for undefined criminal offences.They warned Japarov that, if the measure comes into force, organizations involved in assisting Kyrgyz citizens with obtaining medical equipment and medicine to treat numerous diseases, including cancer and HIV, as well as groups involved in educational programs, human rights, and anti-corruption activities, may have to stop their operations.Since the law was first introduced last year, civil society activists have warned of the consequences of approving such legislation, especially given that similar legislation in Russia laid the groundwork for the systematic dismantling of civil society.The vague laws have been used to persecute organizations working in diverse fields such as education, culture, health care, environmental protection, human-rights defense, and especially independent media.Once called an "island of democracy" in the region, Kyrgyzstan stood out in Central Asia for many years thanks to the independent journalism, intrepid reporting, and media innovation that existed in the country. However, in Reporters Without Borders' most recent global ranking, Kyrgyzstan fell 50 places, sitting in 122nd place -- only 12 spots above its longtime authoritarian neighbor Kazakhstan.Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said his country's support for Ukraine was unwavering during a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on April 3, the Foreign Ministry in Tokyo said. "Prime Minister Kishida said he would like to express heartfelt respect for the courage of President Zelenskiy and the people of Ukraine, and that Japan will not waver in its position of standing together with Ukraine," the ministry said in a statement. Zelenskiy said in a post on X that he briefed Kishida on the battlefield situation and emphasized the need to step up sanction pressure on Russia and create a mechanism for confiscating frozen Russian assets.The Vyasna human rights center in Belarus said on April 3 that the Minsk regional court sentenced a 57-year-old man to six years in prison for sending money to two opposition groups. Alyaksandr Verasovich was found guilty of financially supporting "extremist" groups by sending money via the PayPal system to the BySol fund that assists repressed Belarusian activists and journalists and the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment, consisting of Belarusian citizens who have been fighting alongside Ukrainian forces against occupying Russian troops.

Chernyshov, who was arrested in May 2023, is accused of attempting to transfer Memorial's archives to Germany. Chernyshov's co-defendant, Robert Latypov, is outside of Russia and will be tried separately, in absentia. The authorities ordered Memorial's archives to be transferred to Moscow after the group was liquidated in February 2022.

Last week, another former Soviet republic, Armenia, announced a similar move. In September 2022, the U.S. Treasury Department threatened foreign banks with secondary sanctions for servicing Mir cards, a Russian card-payment system. Earlier, some banks in Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam, as well as Samsung Pay and Apple Pay systems, stopped working with Mir cards.Russian opposition activist and Soviet-era dissident Aleksandr Skobov was arrested late on April 2 in Russia's second-largest city, St. Petersburg, on a charge of promoting terrorism, his associates said. Last month, the 66-year-old was added to Russia's "foreign agents" registry. Skobov's detention came two days after he gave an interview to the Okno website where he called for support of Russian volunteer groups fighting along with Ukraine's military against Russian troops that have invaded Ukraine. He also condemned Russia's ongoing aggression against its neighbor.

For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.We must ensure reliable and predictable security assistance to Ukraine for the long haul so that we rely less on voluntary contributions and more on NATO commitments, less on short-term offers and more on multi-year pledges, NATO Secretary Jens Stoltenberg said as the two-day meeting got under way.The U.S. news website Politico reported on April 2 that U.S. and Western officials were discussing moving the Ukraine Defense Contact Group -- also known as the Ramstein Format, under NATO auspices to maintain support for Ukraine if presumed Republican Party candidate Donald Trump wins the U.S. presidential election in November. Trump has been critical of additional aid to Ukraine and of NATO.The Ramstein Format was created by U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin shortly after the February 2022 full-scale invasion and has been credited with facilitating tens of billions of dollars in critical military and other aid to Ukraine.The previous day, Kuleba was in The Hague for an international conference titled Restoring Justice For Ukraine. Kuleba announced the opening of an online Register of Damages, urging Ukrainians to request compensation for damages or destruction of residential property incurred during Russias full-scale invasion since February 2022.In a concluding statement at the Restoring Justice For Ukraine conference, representatives of 44 countries condemned acts of aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine and confirmed their commitment to the creation of a special tribunal for the investigation and prosecution of the crime of aggression against Ukraine.Georgia's ruling party, Georgian Dream, says it will reintroduce a controversial "foreign agent" bill that was pulled last year amid massive protests over fears the legislation, which mirrored a similar law in Russia, would severely restrict dissent and the activity of civil society groups in the country and push it toward authoritarianism."Instead of using the phrase 'agent of foreign influence,' the phrase 'organization carrying the interests of a foreign power' will be used. All other parts of the draft law are unchanged," Mdinaradze said.In March 2023, parliament began readings to approve the draft, but it abruptly halted the process after Georgian Dream announced it was withdrawing the proposed legislation in the face of the protests.Tens of thousands of protesters who had taken to the streets of the Georgian capital over the legislation were met by heavily armed police that used tear gas, stun grenades, and water cannons to break up the demonstration. Dozens of people were detained.Parliament took up the "foreign agents" legislation despite warnings from critics that the bill, which would force civil society organizations that receive more than 20 percent of their funding from abroad to be classified as "foreign agents," mirrors Russian legislation that has been used to stifle opposition voices and the independent media.In Georgia, anti-Russian sentiment can often be strong. Russian troops still control around one-fifth of Georgia's territory, most of it taken during a lightning war in 2008 that was ostensibly about breakaway efforts in two northeastern regions, Abkhazia and South Ossetia.While Georgian Dream deescalated the crisis by withdrawing the legislation, tensions persist over the ruling party and its opponents' competing visions for the heavily polarized Caucasus country and its nearly 5 million residents.The opposition has often criticized Georgian Dream for being too closely aligned with Moscow and the Kremlin's current war against another former Soviet republic, Ukraine, has heightened those concerns.Georgia has been moving toward joining the European Union but EU officials said the "foreign agent" law would complicate that membership path. Last year, the bloc declined to grant candidate status to Georgia, citing stalled political and judicial reforms.A U.S. intelligence warning to Moscow two weeks ahead of a deadly March 22 terrorist attack included specific reference to the Crocus City Hall concert venue that was targeted, The Washington Post reported on April 2.According to the report, which was later confirmed by The New York Times, U.S. officials told Moscow that the Islamic State extremist group was plotting an attack and that Crocus City Hall was a potential target.However, three days before the attack, Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to acknowledge receiving the warnings, though he dismissed them as "provocative statements" by the West that were meant to "resemble outright blackmail and the intention to intimidate and destabilize our society."Four gunmen stormed the concert hall outside of Moscow just before a concert, killing 144 people in the deadliest terrorist attack in Russia since 2004. The Islamic State, a designated terrorist group, quickly claimed responsibility for the attack.Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials and commentators have claimed without evidence that Ukraine might have played a role in the attack. Ukrainian officials have denied any involvement and have accused Moscow of using the tragedy to ramp up its war against their country.The Crocus attack was a major failure for Russia's security forces, which critics say are focused on stifling domestic political dissent and opposition to the war against Ukraine, often prosecuting political opinions as "terrorism" or "extremism."Police in London say a March 29 stabbing of an Iranian journalist is being investigated by the Counter Terrorism Command, although investigators have not established a motive. A police statement on April 2 said the authorities believe three suspects were involved in the attack, in which self-exiled Persian-language journalist Pouria Zeraati suffered an injury to his leg. The three men abandoned their vehicle shortly after the incident and left the country by air within hours, police said. Zeraati works for Iran International television, which has been critical of Iran's government.An accidental oil leakage during production, discharge of industrial water containing petroleum products, or a possible emergency situation with service vessels are among the potential causes of a leak.But the North Caspian Operating Company (NCOC), a consortium largely owned by the Western oil companies that operate the offshore field, said the satellite images showed a different, natural phenomenon, and subsequent images of the same location showed nothing unusual.The NCOC on March 29 held public hearings on its work in the marine complex. Company managers said then that the company did not allow pollution of the air or the sea and referred to reports and presentations of NCOC specialists and project developers in which they said the company was striving for zero emissions in the local environment.Questions were also addressed to the Ecology Department of the Atyrau region about what measures had been taken to deal with the alleged spill and whether damage to the marine environment and biodiversity had been determined."If these facts are confirmed, the Department of Ecology for the Atyrau region will conduct an unscheduled inspection of the NCOC company. The results will be reported," the department said in a statement.The United States had no involvement in an air strike on Iran's consular annex building in the Syrian capital, Damascus, that Tehran blamed on Israel, the White House said on April 2. "We had nothing to do with the strike in Damascus. We weren't involved in any way whatsoever," National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told a briefing. Kirby dismissed as "nonsense" comments by Iran's foreign minister that the United States, Israel's main backer, bore responsibility for the attack, which killed seven members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.Authorities in Belarus have arrested a well-known activist on charges punishable by up to four years in prison, the Vyasna human rights group said on April 2. Dzmitry Kuchuk, whose Green Party was shut down last year, has been charged with organizing activities that grossly violate public order, according to Vyasna. The center said Kuchuk, 50, was arrested on February 16 in Minsk when he attempted to lay flowers and light a candle in memory of Russian opposition politician Aleksei Navalny, whose death was announced that day. Authorities ordered Kuchuk jailed for two 15-day periods before filing charges against him.NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has proposed creating a 100 billion-euro ($108 illion), five-year fund for Ukraine in a push to get the alliance more involved in sending weapons to Kyiv. NATO foreign ministers will hold preliminary talks on the plan in Brussels on April 3 as they seek to forge a support package for Ukraine by a July summit in Washington. "Foreign ministers will discuss the best way to organize NATO's support for Ukraine, to make it more powerful, predictable, and enduring," a NATO official said on April 2.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on April 2 signed into law a bill lowering the mobilization age from 27 to 25, the website of the Ukrainian parliament -- the Verkhovna Rada -- said. The bill was approved by lawmakers in May 2023. Media reports said earlier that Zelenskiy hesitated to sign the bill, saying that he needed to see a detailed plan by the military on how new recruits would be deployed to replace those who have been on the battlefield since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.The residents held a rally on April 1 on the heels of the announcement of the project by Tehran's municipality, with the mayor's office advocating for the construction of mosques in public spaces. Police maintained a significant presence at the protest site, though no disturbances were reported.The campaign, particularly for the mayor's proposal for a mosque in Qeytarieh Park, has drawn criticism for coming at a time when the city's financial resources could be better allocated toward supporting the underprivileged rather than constructing new religious structures.An official from the Cultural Heritage Department of Tehran Province announced that fences installed by the municipality around the site where the mosque is to be built had been dismantled, though the news has not been confirmed.The construction plan has drawn further scrutiny amid revelations last year by Mohammad Abolghassem Doulabi, a senior Iranian cleric, that 50,000 out of 75,000 mosques across the country had closed due to dwindling attendance.A lawyer for several survivors and relatives of victims of the terrorist attack at the Crocus City Hall entertainment center near Moscow said many have filed lawsuits against the venue's owners, accusing them of fire safety violations.On the night of the attack, the stage curtain -- supposedly made of fireproof material -- caught fire in seconds, the doors of many evacuation exits were locked, and the smoke removal system in the hall did not work, increasing the number of victims, according to lawyer Igor Trunov, who was quoted by RIA Novosti on April 2.Aras Agalarov, who has roots in Azerbaijan, said earlier that the fire safety system in the entertainment center was working properly when several men in military uniform rushed into the Crocus City Hall and started shooting minutes before a concert by the rock group Piknik on March 22.The Islamic State extremist group claimed responsibility for the attack, while Russian officials have said that Ukraine and Western countries were involved but have provided no evidence to support the claim.The U.S. Embassy in Moscow has slammed a Russian court ruling to extend the pretrial detention of RFE/RL journalist Alsu Kurmasheva until June 5, calling the countrys crackdown on independent media unacceptable.Kurmasheva, a Prague-based journalist with RFE/RL who holds dual U.S. and Russian citizenship, has been held in Russian custody since October 18 on a charge of violating the so-called "foreign agent" law.RFE/RL and the U.S. government say the charge is a reprisal for her work as journalist for RFE/RL. She had traveled to Russia to visit and care for her elderly mother and was initially detained while waiting for her return flight on June 2 at Kazan airport, where her passports were confiscated.We are deeply concerned about the detention of Alsu Kurmasheva in the Russian Federation, which the court extended, Ambassador Lynne Tracy said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, on April 2, adding that representatives from the embassy were present in court in Kazan.Before the court proceedings, Kurmasheva told reporters that she is "not very well physically" and that her living conditions in detention "are very bad. She added that she was receiving "minimal" medical care and that conditions in her cell were primitive, with a hole in the floor serving as a toilet.Kurmasheva, 47, was arrested in Kazan last October and charged with failing to register as a "foreign agent" under a punitive Russian law that targets journalists, civil society activists, and others. Shes also been charged with spreading falsehoods about the Russian military and faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.The prize, created in 1997, is an annual award that honors a person or a group of people who make an "outstanding" contribution to the defense and promotion of press freedom across the globe despite the "danger and persecution" they face.Kurmasheva is one of four RFE/RL journalists -- Andrey Kuznechyk, Ihar Losik, and Vladyslav Yesypenko are the other three -- currently imprisoned on charges related to their work. Rights groups and RFE/RL have called repeatedly for the release of all four, saying they have been wrongly detained.Losik is a blogger and contributor for RFE/RLs Belarus Service who was convicted in December 2021 on several charges including the organization and preparation of actions that grossly violate public order and sentenced to 15 years in prison.Kuznechyk, a web editor for RFE/RLs Belarus Service, was sentenced in June 2022 to six years in prison following a trial that lasted no more than a few hours. He was convicted of creating or participating in an extremist organization.Yesypenko, a dual Ukrainian-Russian citizen who contributed to Crimea.Realities, a regional news outlet of RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service, was sentenced in February 2022 to six years in prison by a Russian judge in occupied Crimea after a closed-door trial. He was convicted of possession and transport of explosives, a charge he steadfastly denies.Police in Russia's Komi Republic detained activist Dmitry Makhov on April 2 for using a picture of the historical flag of Belarus online. Makhov was charged with displaying an extremist symbol on a social network. The white-red-white flag was used by the short-lived Belarusian Democratic Republic in 1918-1920 and reinstated after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. In 1995, the authoritarian ruler of Belarus, Alyaksandr Lukashenka, replaced the historical flag with one similar to that used in the Soviet era. Opposition groups have used the historical flag as their symbol for decades.

"It is absolutely essential to get Ukrainians what they continue to need to defend themselves, particularly when it comes to munitions and air defenses," Blinken told reporters during a visit to France. "It's another reason why the supplementary budget request that President [Joe] Biden has made to [the U.S.] Congress must be fulfilled as quickly as possible."Tehran has vowed revenge after several people, including a senior commander of Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), were killed in an air strike on the Iranian Consulate in Damascus over the weekend that has been attributed to Israel.Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on April 2 that Israel will be made to "regret" the strike at the Iranian Embassy compound in Damascus, which killed Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior commander of the IRGC's Quds Force, and six others believed to be IRGC members.Israel has not said it carried out the attack, though it has ramped up its campaign of air strikes on targets associated with Iran since a war against Hamas, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union, broke out in the Gaza Strip in October. Hamas is supported by Tehran.Military sources said Israeli missiles were fired from the occupied Golan Heights and that the Syrian air defense system intercepted a number of them, though some hit their target, leading to the "total destruction of the building" and the killing and wounding of "everyone inside."Israel -- as per its usual policy -- has not commented on the strike, but the Reuters news agency quoted a senior Israeli government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, as saying those hit had "been behind many attacks on Israeli and American assets and had plans for additional attacks."The White House said it was aware of the reports. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said at a daily news briefing that Washington was "concerned about anything that would be escalatory or cause an increase in conflict in the region."Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian told his Syrian counterpart, Faisal Mekdad, in a phone call that his government holds Israel responsible for the attack and labeled it a breach of all international conventions," according to Iranian state TV.Ali Shamkhani, a political adviser to Khamenei, said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that the United States "remains directly responsible whether or not it was aware of the intention to carry out this attack."If you are in Russia or the Russia-controlled parts of Ukraine and hold a Russian passport or are a stateless person residing permanently in Russia or the Russia-controlled parts of Ukraine, please note that you could face fines or imprisonment for sharing, liking, commenting on, or saving our content, or for contacting us.
risk,Rescuers pulled more bodies from the rubble of a Moscow-area concert venue on March 23 as the toll from a deadly attack claimed by the Islamic State (IS) militant group reached 133 and security officials said four suspected gunmen had been detained in connection with Russias worst terrorist violence in nearly two decades.President Vladimir Putin condemned it as a bloody, barbaric terrorist attack and said in a recorded video address released by the Kremlin that the main thing now is to prevent those who are behind this bloodbath from committing a new crime."The day after camouflaged gunmen burst into the Crocus City Hall and opened fire on people waiting for a concert to begin, searchers were still looking for victims in the wreckage of the hall. More than 120 people were wounded and remained hospitalized in various conditions, health officials said.The Emergency Situations Ministry published the names of 29 of the 133 people known so far to have died, and Moscow region Governor Andrei Vorobyov has warned the death toll could still rise "significantly."More makeshift memorials to honor the victims sprang up in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, and many other Russian cities, including flowers, candles, and messages to the families of victims. Flags flew at half-mast above government buildings in some places.At the hollowed-out site of one of the deadliest acts of terror in modern Russian history, School No. 1 in Beslan, in southern Russia, where 333 people including mostly schoolchildren were killed after being taken hostage for three days in 2004, Russians spelled out  "Moscow we mourn" with candles.The chairman of the constitutional law committee in Russia's upper house, Andrei Klishas, spurred more such talk on Telegram by saying that neither chamber of parliament can "overcome decisions of the Constitutional Court."The death penalty remains in the Russian Constitution but has been under an indefinite moratorium for nearly three decades, including since the Constitutional Court in 2009 effectively banned lower courts from ordering executions.In his recorded address, Putin also echoed earlier suggestions by other Russian officials of Ukrainian involvement, saying the four suspected gunmen "tried to hide and were moving toward Ukraine, where, according to preliminary information, the Ukrainian side had prepared a window for them to cross the border."Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Putin of trying to "blame someone else." Alluding to previous violent incidents in Russia, he said, "It already happened. And there were blown up houses, and shootings, and explosions. And they always blame others."The deaths were caused by either gunshot wounds or asphyxiation apparently from burning materials, said the Investigative Committee, adding that the toll was likely climb. Attackers used an unspecified flammable substance to set fire to the venue the committee said.The Russian Investigative Committee said it was awarding one man for "unparalleled courage" when he "selflessly neutralized one of the terrorists" while trying to protect his wife, "saving the lives of the people around him." It did not further identify the man.The identities and motives of the attackers remained unclear. Aleksandr Bortnikov, the director of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying 11 people had been detained, including four of the suspected gunmen.Unnamed officials and Telegram channels known for links to security services suggested that several of the attackers may have been Tajik, or Russian citizens with Tajik background. The reports prompted pushback from Tajikistans Foreign Ministry, which denied the reports and published detailed information on several of the men whose names were circulating.Russia's state broadcaster Channel One TV showed footage of the questioning of four men it said were suspects and a white Renault automobile that they were said to have used in their escape effort. The daylight video followed their capture in Khatsun, the station said.It was supposed to be starting when we heard something which I thought were fireworks or gunshots inside the venue, the eyewitness, identified only as Dave, said in a phone interview. The moment after, we saw beneath us a stream of people running inside the hall. After that, gunshots were already heard inside [the hall]. Of course, panic started on the balcony too. People didn't know where to run."On the same day as the U.S. Embassy announcement, the Federal Security Service claimed it had stopped an attack on a Moscow synagogue by Islamic State's affiliate in Afghanistan, known as Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K).U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed "our deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of those killed and all affected by this heinous crime" and said, "We condemn terrorism in all its forms and stand in solidarity with the people of Russia in grieving the loss of life from this horrific event."On March 23, German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser told the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper that "According to everything that is known so far, it can be assumed that the terrorist group Islamic State Khorasan Province (IS-K) is responsible for the murderous terrorist attack near Moscow."UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was quoted as saying that he "condemns in the strongest possible terms" the incident, and the United States, France, Turkey, Italy, the European Union, and other leaders also issued statements, deploring the violence.A Russian court on April 3 rejected an appeal filed by a 17-year-old against a six-year prison term he was handed in November for throwing Molotov cocktails at recruitment centers in St. Petersburg and Kirovsk to protest Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Yegor Balazeikin was arrested in February 2023. He said at the time that his actions were strongly influenced by the death of his uncle, who was killed after volunteering to fight in Ukraine. Balazeikin has an autoimmune disease and is legally recognized as disabled.

The airline said on April 3 that the suspension of flights to and from Kazan would come into effect on April 5 and that it was being done "for security reasons." The announcement came a day after a drone attack targeted Tatarstan's industrial facilities in Yelabuga and Nizhnekamsk, injuring 14 people, including foreigners from eight nations, in what appeared to be the deepest such strike inside Russia by Ukrainian armed forces fighting against Russia's ongoing invasion launched in February 2022. Kyiv has not officially claimed responsibility for the attack.Ukraine's fifth president, Petro Poroshenko, told Al-Jazeera television on April 2 that he plans to run for president again after Russia's ongoing invasion of his country is over. Poroshenko also said that, if Ukraine becomes an EU member, he is ready to run for the European Parliament. The presidential election in Ukraine scheduled for March 2024 was postponed indefinitely because of Russia's aggression against its neighbor. Poroshenko served as Ukraine's president in 2014-2019. He lost in a runoff to incumbent Volodymyr Zelenskiy in 2019.

Kuleba announced the opening of an online Register of Damages, urging Ukrainians to request compensation for damages or destruction of residential property incurred during Russias full-scale invasion since February 2022.In a concluding statement at the Restoring Justice For Ukraine conference, representatives of 44 countries condemned acts of aggression by the Russian Federation against Ukraine and confirmed their commitment to the creation of a special tribunal for the investigation and prosecution of the crime of aggression against Ukraine.Georgia's ruling party, Georgian Dream, says it will reintroduce a controversial "foreign agent" bill that was pulled last year amid massive protests over fears the legislation, which mirrored a similar law in Russia, would severely restrict dissent and the activity of civil society groups in the country and push it toward authoritarianism."Instead of using the phrase 'agent of foreign influence,' the phrase 'organization carrying the interests of a foreign power' will be used. All other parts of the draft law are unchanged," Mdinaradze said.In March 2023, parliament began readings to approve the draft, but it abruptly halted the process after Georgian Dream announced it was withdrawing the proposed legislation in the face of the protests.Tens of thousands of protesters who had taken to the streets of the Georgian capital over the legislation were met by heavily armed police that used tear gas, stun grenades, and water cannons to break up the demonstration. Dozens of people were detained.Parliament took up the "foreign agents" legislation despite warnings from critics that the bill, which would force civil society organizations that receive more than 20 percent of their funding from abroad to be classified as "foreign agents," mirrors Russian legislation that has been used to stifle opposition voices and the independent media.In Georgia, anti-Russian sentiment can often be strong. Russian troops still control around one-fifth of Georgia's territory, most of it taken during a lightning war in 2008 that was ostensibly about breakaway efforts in two northeastern regions, Abkhazia and South Ossetia.While Georgian Dream deescalated the crisis by withdrawing the legislation, tensions persist over the ruling party and its opponents' competing visions for the heavily polarized Caucasus country and its nearly 5 million residents.The opposition has often criticized Georgian Dream for being too closely aligned with Moscow and the Kremlin's current war against another former Soviet republic, Ukraine, has heightened those concerns.Georgia has been moving toward joining the European Union but EU officials said the "foreign agent" law would complicate that membership path. Last year, the bloc declined to grant candidate status to Georgia, citing stalled political and judicial reforms.A U.S. intelligence warning to Moscow two weeks ahead of a deadly March 22 terrorist attack included specific reference to the Crocus City Hall concert venue that was targeted, The Washington Post reported on April 2.According to the report, which was later confirmed by The New York Times, U.S. officials told Moscow that the Islamic State extremist group was plotting an attack and that Crocus City Hall was a potential target.However, three days before the attack, Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared to acknowledge receiving the warnings, though he dismissed them as "provocative statements" by the West that were meant to "resemble outright blackmail and the intention to intimidate and destabilize our society."Four gunmen stormed the concert hall outside of Moscow just before a concert, killing 144 people in the deadliest terrorist attack in Russia since 2004. The Islamic State, a designated terrorist group, quickly claimed responsibility for the attack.Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials and commentators have claimed without evidence that Ukraine might have played a role in the attack. Ukrainian officials have denied any involvement and have accused Moscow of using the tragedy to ramp up its war against their country.The Crocus attack was a major failure for Russia's security forces, which critics say are focused on stifling domestic political dissent and opposition to the war against Ukraine, often prosecuting political opinions as "terrorism" or "extremism."Police in London say a March 29 stabbing of an Iranian journalist is being investigated by the Counter Terrorism Command, although investigators have not established a motive. A police statement on April 2 said the authorities believe three suspects were involved in the attack, in which self-exiled Persian-language journalist Pouria Zeraati suffered an injury to his leg. The three men abandoned their vehicle shortly after the incident and left the country by air within hours, police said. Zeraati works for Iran International television, which has been critical of Iran's government.An accidental oil leakage during production, discharge of industrial water containing petroleum products, or a possible emergency situation with service vessels are among the potential causes of a leak.But the North Caspian Operating Company (NCOC), a consortium largely owned by the Western oil companies that operate the offshore field, said the satellite images showed a different, natural phenomenon, and subsequent images of the same location showed nothing unusual.The NCOC on March 29 held public hearings on its work in the marine complex. Company managers said then that the company did not allow pollution of the air or the sea and referred to reports and presentations of NCOC specialists and project developers in which they said the company was striving for zero emissions in the local environment.Questions were also addressed to the Ecology Department of the Atyrau region about what measures had been taken to deal with the alleged spill and whether damage to the marine environment and biodiversity had been determined."If these facts are confirmed, the Department of Ecology for the Atyrau region will conduct an unscheduled inspection of the NCOC company. The results will be reported," the department said in a statement.The United States had no involvement in an air strike on Iran's consular annex building in the Syrian capital, Damascus, that Tehran blamed on Israel, the White House said on April 2. "We had nothing to do with the strike in Damascus. We weren't involved in any way whatsoever," National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told a briefing. Kirby dismissed as "nonsense" comments by Iran's foreign minister that the United States, Israel's main backer, bore responsibility for the attack, which killed seven members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.Authorities in Belarus have arrested a well-known activist on charges punishable by up to four years in prison, the Vyasna human rights group said on April 2. Dzmitry Kuchuk, whose Green Party was shut down last year, has been charged with organizing activities that grossly violate public order, according to Vyasna. The center said Kuchuk, 50, was arrested on February 16 in Minsk when he attempted to lay flowers and light a candle in memory of Russian opposition politician Aleksei Navalny, whose death was announced that day. Authorities ordered Kuchuk jailed for two 15-day periods before filing charges against him.NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg has proposed creating a 100 billion-euro ($108 illion), five-year fund for Ukraine in a push to get the alliance more involved in sending weapons to Kyiv. NATO foreign ministers will hold preliminary talks on the plan in Brussels on April 3 as they seek to forge a support package for Ukraine by a July summit in Washington. "Foreign ministers will discuss the best way to organize NATO's support for Ukraine, to make it more powerful, predictable, and enduring," a NATO official said on April 2.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on April 2 signed into law a bill lowering the mobilization age from 27 to 25, the website of the Ukrainian parliament -- the Verkhovna Rada -- said. The bill was approved by lawmakers in May 2023. Media reports said earlier that Zelenskiy hesitated to sign the bill, saying that he needed to see a detailed plan by the military on how new recruits would be deployed to replace those who have been on the battlefield since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.The residents held a rally on April 1 on the heels of the announcement of the project by Tehran's municipality, with the mayor's office advocating for the construction of mosques in public spaces. Police maintained a significant presence at the protest site, though no disturbances were reported.The campaign, particularly for the mayor's proposal for a mosque in Qeytarieh Park, has drawn criticism for coming at a time when the city's financial resources could be better allocated toward supporting the underprivileged rather than constructing new religious structures.An official from the Cultural Heritage Department of Tehran Province announced that fences installed by the municipality around the site where the mosque is to be built had been dismantled, though the news has not been confirmed.The construction plan has drawn further scrutiny amid revelations last year by Mohammad Abolghassem Doulabi, a senior Iranian cleric, that 50,000 out of 75,000 mosques across the country had closed due to dwindling attendance.A lawyer for several survivors and relatives of victims of the terrorist attack at the Crocus City Hall entertainment center near Moscow said many have filed lawsuits against the venue's owners, accusing them of fire safety violations.On the night of the attack, the stage curtain -- supposedly made of fireproof material -- caught fire in seconds, the doors of many evacuation exits were locked, and the smoke removal system in the hall did not work, increasing the number of victims, according to lawyer Igor Trunov, who was quoted by RIA Novosti on April 2.Aras Agalarov, who has roots in Azerbaijan, said earlier that the fire safety system in the entertainment center was working properly when several men in military uniform rushed into the Crocus City Hall and started shooting minutes before a concert by the rock group Piknik on March 22.The Islamic State extremist group claimed responsibility for the attack, while Russian officials have said that Ukraine and Western countries were involved but have provided no evidence to support the claim.The U.S. Embassy in Moscow has slammed a Russian court ruling to extend the pretrial detention of RFE/RL journalist Alsu Kurmasheva until June 5, calling the countrys crackdown on independent media unacceptable.Kurmasheva, a Prague-based journalist with RFE/RL who holds dual U.S. and Russian citizenship, has been held in Russian custody since October 18 on a charge of violating the so-called "foreign agent" law.RFE/RL and the U.S. government say the charge is a reprisal for her work as journalist for RFE/RL. She had traveled to Russia to visit and care for her elderly mother and was initially detained while waiting for her return flight on June 2 at Kazan airport, where her passports were confiscated.We are deeply concerned about the detention of Alsu Kurmasheva in the Russian Federation, which the court extended, Ambassador Lynne Tracy said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, on April 2, adding that representatives from the embassy were present in court in Kazan.Before the court proceedings, Kurmasheva told reporters that she is "not very well physically" and that her living conditions in detention "are very bad. She added that she was receiving "minimal" medical care and that conditions in her cell were primitive, with a hole in the floor serving as a toilet.Kurmasheva, 47, was arrested in Kazan last October and charged with failing to register as a "foreign agent" under a punitive Russian law that targets journalists, civil society activists, and others. Shes also been charged with spreading falsehoods about the Russian military and faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.The prize, created in 1997, is an annual award that honors a person or a group of people who make an "outstanding" contribution to the defense and promotion of press freedom across the globe despite the "danger and persecution" they face.Kurmasheva is one of four RFE/RL journalists -- Andrey Kuznechyk, Ihar Losik, and Vladyslav Yesypenko are the other three -- currently imprisoned on charges related to their work. Rights groups and RFE/RL have called repeatedly for the release of all four, saying they have been wrongly detained.Losik is a blogger and contributor for RFE/RLs Belarus Service who was convicted in December 2021 on several charges including the organization and preparation of actions that grossly violate public order and sentenced to 15 years in prison.Kuznechyk, a web editor for RFE/RLs Belarus Service, was sentenced in June 2022 to six years in prison following a trial that lasted no more than a few hours. He was convicted of creating or participating in an extremist organization.Yesypenko, a dual Ukrainian-Russian citizen who contributed to Crimea.Realities, a regional news outlet of RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service, was sentenced in February 2022 to six years in prison by a Russian judge in occupied Crimea after a closed-door trial. He was convicted of possession and transport of explosives, a charge he steadfastly denies.Police in Russia's Komi Republic detained activist Dmitry Makhov on April 2 for using a picture of the historical flag of Belarus online. Makhov was charged with displaying an extremist symbol on a social network. The white-red-white flag was used by the short-lived Belarusian Democratic Republic in 1918-1920 and reinstated after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. In 1995, the authoritarian ruler of Belarus, Alyaksandr Lukashenka, replaced the historical flag with one similar to that used in the Soviet era. Opposition groups have used the historical flag as their symbol for decades.

"It is absolutely essential to get Ukrainians what they continue to need to defend themselves, particularly when it comes to munitions and air defenses," Blinken told reporters during a visit to France. "It's another reason why the supplementary budget request that President [Joe] Biden has made to [the U.S.] Congress must be fulfilled as quickly as possible."Tehran has vowed revenge after several people, including a senior commander of Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), were killed in an air strike on the Iranian Consulate in Damascus over the weekend that has been attributed to Israel.Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on April 2 that Israel will be made to "regret" the strike at the Iranian Embassy compound in Damascus, which killed Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior commander of the IRGC's Quds Force, and six others believed to be IRGC members.Israel has not said it carried out the attack, though it has ramped up its campaign of air strikes on targets associated with Iran since a war against Hamas, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union, broke out in the Gaza Strip in October. Hamas is supported by Tehran.Military sources said Israeli missiles were fired from the occupied Golan Heights and that the Syrian air defense system intercepted a number of them, though some hit their target, leading to the "total destruction of the building" and the killing and wounding of "everyone inside."Israel -- as per its usual policy -- has not commented on the strike, but the Reuters news agency quoted a senior Israeli government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, as saying those hit had "been behind many attacks on Israeli and American assets and had plans for additional attacks."The White House said it was aware of the reports. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said at a daily news briefing that Washington was "concerned about anything that would be escalatory or cause an increase in conflict in the region."Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian told his Syrian counterpart, Faisal Mekdad, in a phone call that his government holds Israel responsible for the attack and labeled it a breach of all international conventions," according to Iranian state TV.Ali Shamkhani, a political adviser to Khamenei, said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that the United States "remains directly responsible whether or not it was aware of the intention to carry out this attack."If you are in Russia or the Russia-controlled parts of Ukraine and hold a Russian passport or are a stateless person residing permanently in Russia or the Russia-controlled parts of Ukraine, please note that you could face fines or imprisonment for sharing, liking, commenting on, or saving our content, or for contacting us.
risk,Many parts of Ukraine were experiencing blackouts after a massive wave of Russian strikes on March 22 targeted Ukraine's energy infrastructure, killing at least four people, hitting the country's largest dam, and temporarily severing a power line at the Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant.As the full-scale invasion neared the 25-month mark, Zelenskiy aide Mykhailo Podolyak denied recent reports that the United States had demanded that its ally Kyiv stop any attacks on Russia's oil infrastructure as "fictitious information.""After two years of full-scale war, no one will dictate to Ukraine the conditions for conducting this war," Podolyak told the Dozhd TV channel. "Within the framework of international law, Ukraine can 'degrease' Russian instruments of war. Fuel is the main tool of warfare. Ukraine will destroy the [Russian] fuel infrastructure."The Financial Times quoted anonymous sources as saying that Washington had given "repeated warnings" to Ukraine's state security service and its military intelligence agency to stop attacking Russian oil refineries and energy infrastructure. It said officials cited such attacks' effect on global oil prices and the risk of retaliation.The southern Zaporizhzhya region bore the brunt of the Russian assault that hit Ukraine's energy infrastructure particularly hard on March 22, with at least three people killed, including a man and his 8-year-old daughter. There were at least 20 dead and injured, in all.Ukraine's state hydropower company, Ukrhydroenerho, said the DniproHES hydroelectric dam on the Dnieper in Zaporizhzhya was hit by two Russian missiles that damaged HPP-2, one of the plant's two power stations, although there was no immediate risk of a breach."There is currently a fire at the dam. Emergency services are working at the site, eliminating the consequences of numerous air strikes," Ukrhydroenerho said in a statement, adding that the situation at the dam "is under control.""The world sees the Russian terrorists' targets as clearly as possible: power plants and energy supply lines, a hydroelectric dam, ordinary residential buildings, and even a trolleybus," Zelenskiy wrote."Currently, the temporarily occupied Zaporizhzhya NPP is connected to the unified energy system of Ukraine by two power transmission lines, thanks to which the plant's own needs are fulfilled," the state's nuclear-energy operator wrote on Telegram."The occupiers carried out more than 15 strikes on energy facilities. The city is virtually completely without light," Oleh Synyehubov, the head of Kharkiv regional military administration, wrote on Telegram.In the Odesa region, more than 50,000 households have been left without electricity, regional officials reported. Odesa, Ukraine's largest Black Sea port, has been frequently attacked by Russia in recent months."There are problems with the electricity supply in some areas, but in general, the situation in the energy sector is under control, there is no need for blackouts throughout the country," Shmyhal wrote on Telegram.Ukrenerho also said that it was receiving emergency assistance from its European Union neighbors Poland, Romania, and Slovakia. Ukraine linked its power grid with that of the EU in March 2022, shortly after the start of Russia's invasion."Russian missiles have no delays, unlike aid packages for Ukraine. 'Shahed' drones have no indecision, unlike some politicians. It is critical to understand the cost of delays and postponed decisions," Zelenskiy wrote, appealing to the West to do more for his country.Zelenskiy's message came as EU leaders were wrapping up a summit in Brussels where they discussed ways to speed up ammunition and weapons deliveries for the embattled Ukrainian forces struggling to stave off an increasingly intense assault by more numerous and better-equipped Russian troops.A critical $60 billion military aid package from the United States, Ukraine's main backer, remains stuck in the House of Representatives due to Republican opposition, prompting Kyiv to rely more on aid from its European allies.
risk,EU initiatives against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine have always excluded the agricultural sector. This is meant to avoid side effects on global food security, as Russia is the worlds largest exporter of wheat and a major player in the global fertiliser market.Today, the solidity of these considerations is crumbling in the face of the political necessity to rebuild the pro-Ukrainian front, worn down by months of farmers protests, especially in Eastern Europe.At an EU summit on Thursday, the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is expected to present to EU leaders proposals to restrict food imports from Russia, imposing duties on Moscow cereals.It has backfired, as the collapse in prices caused by the sharp increase in imports of food commodities, mainly cereals, has been one of the key drivers of the farmers protests in Eastern European countries, particularly in Poland, in recent months.In the meantime, according to European Commission data, the EU imported 1.1 million tonnes of cereals from Russia between July 2023 and January 2024, with each monthly import higher than the five-year average for the comparable month.At a time when the price of cereals has sunk to its lowest level since 2020, and the Black Sea Ukrainian corridor exports are resuming, the idea is to ease the pressure on the EU market by restricting access to Russian wheat and other grains.The Latvian Parliament approved a unilateral ban on the import (allowing only transit) of Russian agricultural products. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, under pressure like no one else from farmers protests, said he wanted to follow suit.Last week, in a joint statement with Tusk, von der Leyen announced that the Commission was evaluating the possibility of introducing restrictions on imports of agricultural products from Russia to the European Union and will come forward with a proposal shortly.After sharing a consensus, the political leaders will have to convince the farmers. Russian wheat production over the last two seasons has undoubtedly been at a record high. It is also true that imports of Russian cereals into the EU have increased.But it is hard to see how having 1.1 million or even 1.5 million tonnes less can bring relief for prices and farmers in a continent expected to produce more than 272 million tonnes of grains this year.The EUs auditing body has warned that the European Commissions strategy of relying on member states to ensure the money of the pandemic recovery fund is properly spent is heightening the risk of irregularity or even corruption.Former Italian prime minister Enrico Letta, in charge of the long-awaited Single Market Report, wants to propose a tool resembling tax credits used by the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), he said on Tuesday.Frances Minister for the Armed Forces, Sbastien Lecornu, announced on Monday a new production cycle for tritium, which is essential for the manufacture of nuclear weapons, using state utility EDFs two civilian reactors.The future of the Nature Restoration Law remains uncertain, and the position of key member states is still not clear ahead of an ambassadors meeting on Friday (22 March) to prepare a final vote next Monday.The European Parliaments Industry, Research, and Energy committee voted on Wednesday to improve access for small businesses and startups to artificial intelligence (AI) supercomputers, as well as strengthen environmental standards for such infrastructure.Maltas Socialist (S&D) Prime Minister Robert Abela and President of European Parliament Roberta Metsola, who is a member of the countrys opposition Nationalist Party (EPP), are trading blows over a decades-old debate on using the Maltese language in the institution.Leftists in the European Parliament claimed the top spot in the ranking of political groups environmental performance published by the French environmental association Bloom on Wednesday, with those on the right relegated to the bottom of the table.Lead-producing Bulgaria has the potential to be a major battery supplier and harness the economic opportunities of the green transition, but current EU policies prioritise lithium-ion batteries, participants heard at a conference in Brussels on Tuesday.With the decision to expand NATOs military base near the strategic Black Sea port of Constanta, Romania will have stronger security guarantees, a representative of the Romanian Defence Ministry told Euractiv on Tuesday.
risk,RESTON, Va., March  18, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lightbridge Corporation (Lightbridge) (Nasdaq: LTBR), an advanced nuclear fuel technology company, today announced it had achieved a critical milestone in developing its cutting-edge fuel technology designed to offer improved economics and higher levels of safety than conventional nuclear fuel.

risk,The Biden administration and dozens of other countries have pledged to triple the capacity of nuclear power worldwide in their battle against climate change, ensuring uranium will remain a key commodity for decades as the government offers incentives for developing the next generation of nuclear reactors and new policies take aim at Russia's influence over the supply chain.But as the U.S. pursues its nuclear power potential, environmentalists and Native American leaders remain fearful of the consequences for communities near mining and milling sites in the West and are demanding better regulatory oversight.Producers say uranium production today is different than decades ago when the country was racing to build up its nuclear arsenal. Those efforts during World War II and the Cold War left a legacy of death, disease and contamination on the Navajo Nation and in other communities across the country, making any new development of the ore a hard pill to swallow for many.The new mining at Pinyon Plain Mine near the Grand Canyon's South Rim entrance is happening within the boundaries of the Baaj Nwaavjo Itah Kukv National Monument that was designated in August by President Joe Biden. The work was allowed to move forward since Energy Fuels Inc. had valid existing rights.The mine will cover only 17 acres (6.8 hectares) and will operate for three to six years, producing at least 2 million pounds (about 907,000 kilograms) of uranium  enough to power the state of Arizona for at least a year with carbon-free electricity, he said.Energy Fuels, which also is prepping two more mines in Colorado and Wyoming, has produced about two-thirds of the uranium in the U.S. in the last five years. In 2022, it was awarded a contract to sell $18.5 million in uranium concentrates to the U.S. government to help establish the nations strategic reserve for when supplies might be disrupted.Amid the growing appetite for uranium, a coalition of Native Americans testified before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in late February, asking the panel to pressure the U.S. government to overhaul outdated mining laws and prevent further exploitation of marginalized communities.Carletta Tilousi, who served for years on the Havasupai Tribal Council, said she and others have written countless letters to state and federal agencies and sat through hours of meetings with regulators and lawmakers. Her tribe's reservation lies in a gorge off the Grand Canyon.A group of hydrology and geology professors and nuclear watchdogs sent Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs a letter in January, asking she reconsider permits granted by state environmental regulators that cleared the way for the mine. She has yet to respond and her office declined to answer questions from The Associated Press.Lawyers for Energy Fuels said in a letter to state officials that reopening the permits would be an improper attempt to side step Arizonas administrative procedures and rights protecting permit holders from such politicized actions.The environmentalists' request followed a plea weeks earlier by the Havasupai saying mining at the foot of Red Butte will compromise one of the tribe's most sacred spots. Called Wiii Gdwiisa by the Havasupai, the landmark is central to tribal creation stories and also holds significance for the Hopi, Navajo and Zuni people.It is with heavy hearts that we must acknowledge that our greatest fear has come true, the Havasupai said in a January statement, reflecting on concerns that mining could affect water supplies, wildlife, plants and geology throughout the Colorado Plateau.The U.S. Geological Survey recently partnered with the Havasupai Tribe to examine contamination possibilities that could include exposure through inhalation and ingestion of traditional food and medicines, processing animal hides or absorption through materials collected for face and body painting.Legal challenges aimed at stopping the Pinyon Plain Mine repeatedly have been rejected by the courts, and top officials in the Biden administration are reticent to weigh in beyond speaking generally about efforts to improve consultation with Native American tribes.It marks another front in an ongoing battle over energy development and sacred lands, as tribes in Nevada and Arizona are fighting the federal government over the mining of lithium and the siting of renewable energy transmission lines.The Pinyon Plain Mine, formerly known as the Canyon Mine, was permitted in 1984. Because it retained existing rights, the mine effectively became grandfathered into legal operation despite a 20-year moratorium placed on uranium mining in the Grand Canyon region by the Obama administration in 2012.The U.S. Forest Service in 2012 reaffirmed an environmental impact statement that had been prepared for the mine years earlier, and state regulators signed off on air and aquifer protection permitting within the past two years.Environmental reviews conducted as part of the permitting process have concluded the mine's operation won't affect visitors to the national park, area residents or groundwater or springs associated with the park. Still, environmentalists say the mine raises a bigger question about the Biden administration's willingness to adopt policies favorable of nuclear power.The U.S. Commerce Department under the Trump administration issued a 2019 report describing domestic production as essential to national security, citing the need to maintain the nuclear arsenal and keep commercial nuclear reactors fueled to generate electricity. At that point, nuclear reactors supplied nearly 20% of the electricity consumed in the U.S.The Biden administration is staying the course. It's in the midst of a multibillion-dollar modernization of the nation's nuclear defense capabilities, and the U.S. Energy Department on Wednesday offered a $1.5 billion loan to the owners of a Michigan power plant to restart the shuttered facility, which would mark a first in the U.S.Taylor McKinnon, the Center for Biological Diversity's Southwest director, said pushing for more nuclear power and allowing mining near the Grand Canyon makes a mockery of the administration's environmental justice rhetoric."Using nuclear power to reach emissions goals is a hard sell in the western U.S. From the Navajo Nation to Ute Mountain Ute and Oglala Lakota homelands, tribal communities have deep-seated distrust of uranium companies and the federal government as abandoned mines and related contamination have yet to be cleaned up.A complex of mines on the Navajo Nation recently was added to the federal Superfund list. The eastern edge of the reservation also is home to the largest radioactive accident in U.S. history. In 1979, more than 93 million gallons (350 million liters) of radioactive and acidic slurry spilled from a tailings disposal pond, contaminating water supplies, livestock and downstream communities.

Foreign Policy, 655 15th St NW, Suite 300, Washington, DC, 20005.Russian President Vladimir Putin extended his reign for a fifth term on Sunday in a presidential election whose outcome was predetermined. Putin, 71, won 87 percent of the vote, his highest tally since coming to power in 1999. He is the longest-serving Russian leader since Joseph Stalin, and if he sees his term to its end in 2030, he will be the longest-serving Russian leader since Catherine the Great.Moscows three-day election, held this weekend, was the least transparent vote in recent Russian history, according to independent Russian vote-monitoring group Golos. All genuine opposition candidates were barred from running, imprisoned, dead, or in exile. The only three people allowed to run posed no real threat to Putins hold on power. Much of the international community blames Putin directly for the death of his main opponent, Alexei Navalny, who died in a Russian penal colony last month.Russian officials said voter turnout reached 77 percent this weekend, hitting a record high since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. Yet Golos documented more than 1,400 reports of potential electoral violations, including vote-stuffing, by midafternoon on Sunday. Locals in Russian-occupied areas of eastern Ukraine were reportedly instructed to vote under the watch of armed Russian troops, and anyone found to have obstructed voting procedures was threatened with up to five years in prison.The elections are obviously not free nor fair, U.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky further condemned the vote, saying: These days, the Russian dictator is simulating another election. It is clear to everyone in the world that this figure, as it has already often happened in the course of history, is simply sick for power and is doing everything to rule forever.In his victory speech, Putin lauded Russias war on Ukraine as helping to consolidate society around his leadership. He also warned that direct confrontation between Russia and NATO would be one step away from a full-scale World War III, adding that anything is possible in todays world. Regional experts predict that Putin will use his victory to possibly launch new unpopular policies, as is historic practice for the Kremlinpotentially including a new military mobilization order.Hospital attack. Israel launched a raid on Al-Shifa Hospital, the largest medical center in the Gaza Strip, on Monday. According to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), troops conducted a precise operation to thwart terrorist activity in the complex, targeting senior Hamas officials allegedly inside the building. The IDF said it detained 80 suspects and killed 20 militants, including Faiq Mabhouh, the head of operations for the Hamas governments internal security forces. The Gaza Health Ministry said Israeli soldiers killed numerous Palestinian civilians sheltering in and around Al-Shifa during the raid.This was the second major assault on Al-Shifas facility since war broke out on Oct. 7, 2023. Last November, Israeli forces raided Al-Shifa after claiming that Hamas had a command center within and beneath the hospital. According to the Gaza Health Ministry, around 30,000 Palestinians, including patients and medical staff, are currently in the complex.Also on Monday, Israeli negotiators traveled to Doha, Qatar, to resume cease-fire talks. Israeli officials hope to secure the release of all hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza. Hamas leaders continue to call for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and more humanitarian aid deliveries, among other demands. Dialogue comes as the European Unions foreign-policy chief, Josep Borrell, accused Israel over the weekend of provoking famine in Gaza.Summit for Democracy. South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol kicked off the three-day Summit for Democracy on Monday by calling on countries to work together to combat fake news and disinformation. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken echoed his remarks, adding that as authoritarian and repressive regimes deploy technologies to undermine democracy and human rights, we need to ensure that technology sustains and supports democratic values and norms.As the proceedings got underway, though, North Korea launched several short-range ballistic missiles into the Pacific waters off its eastern coast on Monday. Seoul, along with Japan and the United States, called the military actions a clear provocation, and mere hours later, South Korean Defense Minister Shin Won-sik accused Pyongyang of shipping around 7,000 containers carrying munitions and other military equipment to Moscow last year.Antiterrorist operations. Pakistan launched two airstrikes into eastern Afghanistan on Monday, killing at least eight people, including three children. Pakistans foreign ministry said it had carried out intelligence-based antiterrorist operations and accused the Taliban of aiding militants associated with Jaish-e-Mohammed, an Islamist group connected to the Pakistani Taliban that allegedly attacked a military post near the Afghan border over the weekend.Terrorism against us is mostly being conducted from Afghanistan, said Pakistani Defense Minister Khawaja Asif. The Afghan Taliban denied the accusations. Last year, most of the more than 650 attacks reported in Pakistan targeted provinces that bordered Afghanistan. And Islamabad maintains that its main adversary is Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, a militant group ideologically aligned with the Afghan Taliban.There may be such a thing as too much money.

risk,Last year, the Coalition was all over the purported future of nuclear power, constantly reiterating that SMRs were the solution to Australias energy needs. With the plug-and-play of the new smallmodular reactors, you can replace the coal-fired generation and distribute through the existing network, Peter Dutton said.Indeed, SMRs are the only feasible firming option he told an economic conference. The only thing that was in the way was the ideology of old hippies in Labor. Otherwise, we could just plug and play our way to unlimited atomic power.Alas, pack your bags, SMRs. As of yesterday, and fresh off what even the press gallery is now describing as a poor outcome in Dunkley, the opposition leader has moved on to large nuclear reactors. In the Financial Review, Phil Coorey cruelly quoted Duttons hapless LNP energy shadow Ted OBrien last year referring to how nobody wants old Soviet technology, you wouldnt touch it with a barge pole.What has changed is the only company in the US trying to build an SMR, NuScale Power in Idaho, cancelled its project in November. OBrien, humiliatingly, had touted NuScale in a piece for News Corp in May. NuScales integrated reactors offer exceptional flexibility with modulars making for simple expansion. Its first build will be in Idaho in 2029, OBrien trilled.OBrien hadnt done his research  the Idaho SMR died, despite more than US$1 billion in government subsidies, because no-one wanted to pay $89/MWh for power, which is the cost the company revealed last January. NuScale had previously claimed the SMR would produce power at $58/MWh.Ah cost increases.On Monday, French newspaper Les Echos reported that French state-owned utility EDF had raised its already large cost estimate for the construction of six new nuclear reactors from 51.7 billion to 67.4 billion (US$73 billion or A$110 billion)  and flagged costs could rise higher. France gets 70% of its electricity from nuclear power and now needs to build new plans to replace ageing operations built in the 1960s and 1970s.This is unrelated to the cost blowouts at EDFs Flamanville project (or Phlegm Orville as the Institute of Public Affairs calls it), which is more than a decade late and at least triple its original estimate (its been under construction since 2007). Dutton has touted both major EDF projects.EDF also has to fund the construction of the Hinkley Point reactor project in the UK. Originally budgeted at 20 billion, then 26-27 billion in 2022, last year EDF revised the cost up to 32.7 billion, or more than A$63 billion. Originally scheduled to be completed in 2027, Hinkley Point has been delayed to at least 2029-31.EDF is the most experienced nuclear power operator in the Western world, and if it cant get its costings right, then no-one can. The French governments expensive re-nationalisation of the utility in 2023 was an admission that nuclear power is not a commercially viable sector.These massive cost increases and delays come with a real cost for consumers. As the NuScale debacle illustrates, endless construction cost increases  and the debt they demand for the companies behind the projects  push up the eventual cost per MWh for consumers.The poster child for this is the Vogtle project in Georgia  two new nuclear power reactors to go with two older installations, which cost an estimated US$35 billion (A$53 billion), compared to an initial costing of US$14 billion. The Trump administration was forced to step in to guarantee US$12 billion in debt for the project, which ended up eight years late. Vogtles estimated electricity costs are US$170180/MWh  including an extra 10% a month to help offset the final uncovered costs of the reactors.Never mind the which electorate will the reactors go in stuff: this is what Dutton is now selling  decade-long delays, cost blowouts in the tens of billions, monstrously expensive power, government debt guarantees as the very least, and likely a direct government role in funding the power industry.Many have now cottoned on to the fact that  as Crikey has been saying for years  proposing nuclear power in Australia is simply a delaying tactic to prop up coal-fired power. But Dutton is proposing a colossal big-government policy that will risk the federal budget, force consumers to pay extraordinary power costs, and, of course, deliver nothing until the 2040s.Is there merit to Duttons nuclear proposal?

risk,Once upon a time, America embraced nuclear power as the future of energy. Today it accounts for a mere 18 percent of the nation's electricity generation, while fossil fuels remain dominant at 60 percent. Why did nuclear fail to take off?From 1967 to 1972, the nuclear sector experienced significant growth, and 48 new nuclear plants were built. But in March 1979, a meltdown at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, which resulted in no casualties and no lingering environmental damage, spooked the entire nation and empowered anti-nuclear activists."After Three Mile Island, what was considered to be in the best interest of the public was just reducing risk to as low as possible," says Adam Stein, director of the Nuclear Energy Innovation Program at the Breakthrough Institute. "It resulted in a huge volume of regulations that anybody who wanted to build a new reactor had to know. It made the learning curve much steeper to even attempt to innovate in the industry."After the incident, the momentum behind nuclear reactor construction tapered off and no new reactors were built for the next two decades. Nowadays, the landscape remains unchanged: The federal government makes permitting arduous, while many states impose severe restrictions on new plant construction and force operational ones to shut down prematurely.For example, take Indian Point Energy Center, the largest nuclear plant in New York State. In 2007, anti-nuclear activists targeted the plant, which provided a quarter of downstate New York's electricity. Their cause gained significant traction with the support of New York state attorney generaland future governorAndrew Cuomo, who believed the nuclear plant was "risky."Cuomo promised to usher in a new era of clean energy for New Yorkers. His moves against Indian Point garnered support from fellow Green New Deal advocates, including Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (DN.Y.), as well as environmental groups.The plant eventually closed in April 2021, but there was "a gulf between intentions and results," explains writer Eric Dawson, co-founder of Nuclear New York, a group fighting to protect the industry. The closure of Indian Point increased New York's carbon emissions. State utilities had to make up for the loss of energy by burning more natural gas, resulting in a 9 percent increase in energy-related CO2 emissions. At the same time, the state's energy prices also increased.This outcome isn't unique to New York. Germany also opted to phase out nuclear power, betting on wind instead. Electricity from windmills increased, but so did the country's reliance on coal. In 2023, Germany emitted almost eight times the carbon per kilowatt-hour than neighboring France, which still gets the majority of its electricity from nuclear and less than 1 percent from coal.According to Dawson, nuclear power is "the most scalable, reliable, efficient, land-conserving, material-sparing, zero-emission source of energy ever created." Wind and solar aren't as reliable because they depend on intermittent weather. They also require much more land than nuclear plants, which use about 1 percent of what solar farms need and 0.3 percent of what wind farms require to yield the same amount of energy.The economics of nuclear power are undoubtedly challenging, but its advocates say that's primarily because of its thorny politics. The headache of building a new power plant is vividly exemplified by Georgia's Plant Vogtle. The first U.S. reactor built from scratch since 1974, the project turned into a nightmare scenario: It took almost 17 years from when the first permit was filed for construction to begin, it cost more than $28 billion, and it bankrupted the developer in the process.Nuclear regulation is "based on politics and fear-mongering and a lack of understanding," explains Indian Point's vice president, Frank Spagnuolo. If they aren't shut down, he says, power plants such as Indian Point could safely continue to provide clean energy for decades.Despite the opposition, there remains some hope for the future of nuclear energy. Companies are actively developing next-generation nuclear technologies, such as small modular reactors and molten salt-cooled reactors, to minimize the risks associated with nuclear meltdowns and explosions. And some former nuclear opponents have become advocates, acknowledging it as a vital source of clean energy. The converts include the Environmental Defense Fund, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and even Rep. Ocasio-Cortez. The Biden administration has also demonstrated support for nuclear power, with the Department of Energy projecting a tripling of nuclear energy production in America by 2050.Photo Credits: Louis Lanzano/Polaris/Newscom; Erik McGregor/Pacific Press/Newscom; JB NICHOLAS/Splash News/Newscom; Erik Mcgregor/ZUMA Press/Newscom; Erik Thomas/NY Post/MEGA/Newscom/DBNYC/Newscom; Pool/ABACA/Newscom; Jon G.

risk,1. The eleventh United States-European Union (EU) Energy Council   ("Council") met today in Washington, chaired by U.S. Deputy Secretary of   State Kurt Campbell, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy David M. Turk,   European Commissioner for Energy Kadri Simson, and EEAS Acting Deputy   Secretary General Blen Martinez Carbonell. The Deputy Head of Mission   of the Kingdom of Belgium to the United States of America, Sophie   Karlshausen, represented the Presidency of the Council of the European   Union.2. The U.S.-EU Energy Council serves as the lead transatlantic forum   for coordinating strategic energy issues at political and technical   levels. Transatlantic energy cooperation is vital to advancing diverse   and resilient energy systems, bolstering energy security, promoting   stability and transparency in global energy markets, and accelerating   just energy transitions consistent with our mutual commitment to   net-zero greenhouse gas emissions at home and globally by 2050.3. On this occasion, the Council also recognized the important work   of the U.S.-EU Task Force on Energy Security, which helped ensure the   EU's energy security, achieve a 99% EU natural gas storage filling level   ahead of the winter 2023-24, and phase out reliance on Russian fossil   fuels. Moving forward, the EU and the US will continue working closely   together and build on these efforts to ensure energy security in Europe   and beyond and contribute to decarbonization globally.4. The Council welcomed the outcome of the first global stocktake   under the Paris Agreement, including the call on all Paris Agreement   Parties to come forward in their next nationally determined   contributions with ambitious, economy-wide emission reduction targets,   covering all greenhouse gases, sectors and categories and aligned with   limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Council also   emphasized the need for the world to transition away from fossil fuels   in energy systems in a just, orderly, and equitable manner, accelerating   action in this critical decade, so as to achieve net zero by 2050 in   keeping with the science.5. In this context, the Council reiterated the urgency of phasing out   unabated coal in the energy sector globally, in particular ending the   continued investment in new coal-fired power plants. The Council   underlined its commitment to advance on the COP28 goals of tripling   renewable energy capacity and doubling the global average annual rate of   energy efficiency improvements by 2030, including through action at   national, regional, and local levels. Energy systems with diverse and   resilient supply chains that do not overly rely on a single supplier for   fuels, critical raw materials and minerals, or other inputs are key to   reducing dependencies and countering attempts to weaponize energy.6. The Council reaffirmed its enduring commitment to Ukraine and its   people. We strongly condemn Russia's illegal and unprovoked war of   aggression against Ukraine, including attacks on the nation's energy and   civil infrastructure. We stress the need to continue military support,   notably air defense, to protect such infrastructure, and are increasing   our efforts to provide humanitarian aid and critical energy sector   assistance. We reiterate our demand for Russia to immediately and   unconditionally withdraw all its military forces and equipment from the   entire territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized   borders. The Council stresses the importance of security and stability   in the Black Sea.7. The Council acknowledged the important contributions of the United   States, the EU, and its Member States, including through the G7+   coordination group, to provide Ukraine with essential material,   technical, and financial assistance to rapidly repair, restore, and   defend its energy systems and to support Ukraine's efforts to build a   more resilient, sustainable, and decentralized energy system that is   more integrated with Europe. The Council highlighted the will of the G7+   group to work with Ukraine on its Integrated National Energy and   Climate Plan and to implement the Clean Energy Partnership including   further necessary reforms, which are essential to attracting private   sector investment for Ukraine's green recovery and reconstruction.8. The Council welcomed Ukraine's formal membership in the European   Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) and   commended the completion of required actions to enable its permanent   synchronization with the power systems of continental Europe. This   milestone enhances regional energy security and helps enable Ukraine and   Europe to accelerate the broader energy transition. The United States   and the EU also recalled the growing number of cyber and physical   threats to energy infrastructure and plan to continue related   cooperation to bolster resilient energy systems, including in the   context of the ongoing synchronization of the Baltic States' electricity   networks with the Continental European Network.9. The Council reiterated its strong condemnation of Russia's   continued control as well as irresponsible and dangerous actions at and   around Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP) that puts   countless people at risk. The Council reaffirmed its support for the   five concrete principles presented by the International Atomic Energy   Agency (IAEA) Director General to the UN Security Council and for the   Agency's work to apply safeguards and assist Ukraine in managing the   safety and security of its nuclear facilities. The Council welcomed   Ukraine joining the IAEA Board of Governors. The United States and the   EU strongly call on Russia to heed the resolutions of the IAEA Board of   Governors and General Conference, to unconditionally withdraw its   personnel and military equipment from the ZNPP, to give full and   unhindered access to IAEA experts to all areas of the ZNPP, and to   return its full control to its rightful owner, Ukraine.10. The Council reiterated its strongest commitment to confront, with   adequate measures, Russia's efforts to destabilize the global energy   markets and to circumvent sanctions. In this context, the Council   intends to continue intensifying cooperation on the enforcement of the   oil price cap, coordinating bilateral and multilateral responses to   mitigate excessive market volatility, supporting the energy transition   required to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, and continue   cooperative measures on energy efficiency, electrification, and other   initiatives to reduce reliance on fossil fuels in general, and Russian   fossil fuels in particular in order to limit Russia's ability to finance   its war of aggression against Ukraine. We reaffirmed our resolve to   continue taking steps to limit Russia's future energy revenue, which   directly supports the brutal war against Ukraine.11. To promote energy diversification, security, resilience and   sustainability, the Council recalled the strategic importance of energy   relations with partner countries in regions such as the Caspian Sea,   Black Sea, Eastern Mediterranean, and North Africa. The pivotal role of   reliable energy partners in these regions calls for mutually beneficial   cooperation on security of energy supplies as well as enhanced   cooperation on critical infrastructure.12. The Council reaffirmed that the future of Ukraine, the Republic   of Moldova, the Western Balkans, as well as Georgia, and their citizens,   lies with the EU and would continue supporting their integration with   the EU, including through the enlargement process as a matter of   priority for the years to come.13. The Council welcomed the European Council's 14 December 2023   decision to also open EU accession negotiations with Ukraine and the   Republic of Moldova and reaffirmed continued support for their citizens.   The Council intends to continue assisting the countries' long-term   economic and energy transition towards climate neutrality and   integration with the EU's energy system, including by accelerating the   development of energy infrastructure and interconnections. The Council   welcomed Ukraine's and the Republic of Moldova's reform efforts towards   meeting the objectives underpinning their candidacy for EU membership   and encouraged the countries to continue to make progress on these   reforms.14. The Council reaffirmed that both sides intend to deepen   cooperation to support regional integration and energy sector   investments to achieve climate neutrality in the Western Balkans,   including by supporting decarbonization efforts and phasing out their   dependency on coal and Russian natural gas and oil imports as soon as   possible. The United States and the EU continue to promote transparent,   integrated, and competitive energy markets in the Western Balkans, in   line with EU enlargement policy, as well as with the climate and energy   objectives and obligations under the Energy Community Treaty.15. The United States and the EU pledged to continue to cooperate   closely, at multilateral and bilateral levels, to encourage investments   and complementary policies, standards, and regulations in the transition   towards climate neutrality. Including through our Clean Energy   Incentives Dialogue, we intend to work in a transparent and mutually   reinforcing manner, to avoid zero-sum competition and distortions in   transatlantic trade and investment flows that could arise from our   respective policies and incentives.16. The Council welcomed the 2023 announcement of an international   working group to establish an internationally aligned approach, which   builds on existing frameworks on greenhouse gas supply chain emissions   measurement, monitoring, reporting and verification (MMRV) framework for   providing transparent, comparable, and reliable information to natural   gas market participants.17. The Council intends to continue advancing the implementation of   the Global Methane Pledge, including through promoting effective global   schemes to limit leakage, venting, and flaring in the natural gas, oil,   and coal sector, with particular attention to reducing methane emissions   from internationally-traded fossil fuels. The Council recognized the   UNEP's International Methane Emissions Observatory as a key independent   methane emissions data collector and verifier, and intends to continue   to support its initiatives, including the Oil and Gas Methane   Partnership 2.0 and the Methane Alert and Response System with strong   industry engagement.18. Further, the Council noted the role that nuclear power can play   in decarbonizing energy systems in countries that have decided or will   decide to rely on nuclear energy. The United States and the EU intend to   intensify cooperation to reduce dependency on Russia for nuclear   materials and fuel cycle services, and support ongoing efforts by   affected EU Member States to diversify nuclear supplies, as appropriate.   The Council expressed support for multilateral efforts to identify   alternative nuclear energy-related suppliers across the global nuclear   supply chain for relevant countries.19. The Council noted interest in enhancing cooperation to promote   the development of rules-based and transparent global hydrogen markets   based on reliable international standards and certification schemes   primarily through mutually agreed-upon international platforms.20. The Council noted the vital importance of diversifying and   securing supply chains for critical minerals and raw materials as well   as voluntary stockpiling necessary for the energy transition to   climate-neutrality and reinforced the value of U.S.-EU collaboration in   fora such as the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) and its newly   established MSP Forum, the Conference on Critical Materials and   Minerals, and the International Energy Agency Critical Minerals Working   Party, as well as the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and   Investment. The Council welcomed a jointly drafted discussion paper on   lithium supply for the energy transition and signaled support for a set   of U.S.-EU focused stakeholder roundtables over the coming year and an   accompanying recommendations document to map pathways to foster supply   chain linkages between the United States and the EU.21. Furthering last year's Council endorsement to build on existing   dialogues and frameworks, the Council noted research and innovation   cooperation advancements in the fields of i) fusion research,   development, and commercialization, in particular based on the new Model   Project Agreement, and through the ITER Project, and ii) mutual   modelling capabilities for transition pathways to climate-neutrality. In   particular, the Council welcomed joint work on scenario development of   transition pathways with applications of machine learning.22. As the United States and the EU scale up policies and   technologies that intend to drive decarbonization particularly in hard   to abate sectors, carbon capture and storage has emerged as an area for   joint cooperation. Following a series of policy exchanges, the Council   identified two technology and innovation collaboration areas: CO2   transport and carbon capture demonstrations for emerging applications.23. The Council noted the U.S.-EU co-convened workshop in 2023 on   just transition, energy poverty, and economic and workforce development   assistance for communities in transition, disadvantaged communities, and   communities experiencing environmental hazard exposure. Further, the   Council supported the intent to hold a second workshop, focused on   multi-level governance in energy poverty policies, to take place in   2024, followed by the publication of a joint summary document.24. Looking ahead and building on the aforementioned joint   activities, the United States and the EU intend to continue to   ambitiously and resolutely strengthen their strategic relationship to   ensure energy security, align policies, and deepen cooperation on   technologies and innovation, all with the aim of accelerating the global   transition to climate neutrality. The United States and the EU intend   to also continue working closely together to this end in international   fora.
safe,By  Justine Calma, a senior science reporter covering climate change, clean energy, and environmental justice with more than a decade of experience. She is also the host of Hell or High Water: When Disaster Hits Home, a podcast from Vox Media and Audible Originals.More than 30 countries have pledged to pursue nuclear energy as one way to meet global climate goals. Even so, nuclear energy is still a controversial energy source thats bogged down by concerns about radioactive waste, safety, and high costs.At a nuclear energy summit in Brussels yesterday, the countries pledged to work to fully unlock the potential of nuclear energy by taking measures such as enabling conditions to support and competitively finance the lifetime extension of existing nuclear reactors, the construction of new nuclear power plants and the early deployment of advanced reactors, The Associated Press reports. The US, China, Japan, France, Britain, and Saudi Arabia were among the 34 countries to sign the pledge.Its a bold statement to support a source of energy over which many governments and environmental groups are deeply divided. Nuclear energy doesnt generate the greenhouse gas emissions heating up the planet, but the environmental footprint of its supply chain and waste creates other problems. And after decades of missteps, the technology still has to prove whether it can be an affordable, safe alternative to the fossil fuels causing climate change.Nearly every nation on Earth has committed to fighting climate change as part of the Paris agreement. That requires a transition from fossil fuels to clean energy over the next few decades. Fortunately, renewables like solar and wind energy are already cheaper than coal and gas and are forecast to make up a majority of new electricity sources deployed in coming years. The challenge is in finding backup energy sources for times when winds die down and the sun sets.Proponents of nuclear energy say its the perfect complement to renewables since nuclear reactors are able to generate electricity around the clock. Nuclear energy is indispensable along with renewable energy ... We must devise strategy to attract further investment which is necessary to enhance the use of nuclear energy, Japans Parliamentary Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs Komura Masahiro said during the Nuclear Energy Summit held yesterday by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).Its a remarkable turnaround from fears stoked more than a decade ago when an earthquake and tsunami triggered a catastrophic meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station in Japan. In December, Japan was one of more than 20 countries that agreed to triple renewable energy capacity globally by 2050. The country still plans to prioritize renewable energy, Masahiro said, and at the same time, Japan will continuously reflect upon the lessons from the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station and ensure that the use of nuclear power places safety as its top priority.Theres still skepticism over whether a nuclear renaissance is a good idea. Existing reactors and the radioactive waste they produce still pose risks. IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossihas tried to broker agreements between Russia and Ukraine to prevent a meltdown at Ukraines Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant amid the ongoing war. In the US, tribes and environmental advocates have fought to stop a resurgence of uranium mining that has a legacy of polluting water sources in the past.At the summit, John Podesta, US senior adviser to the president for clean energy innovation and implementation, touted the construction of the countrys first completely new power plant in decades. The Vogtle Unit 3 reactor in Georgia finally started operating last year, no less than $17 billion over budget after seven years of delays.Next-generation nuclear reactors are supposed to be easier and cheaper to build. But they havent overcome the radioactive waste problem. Theyll require more highly enriched uranium, of which Russia has been the largest supplier. And a key demonstration project using advanced small modular reactors in Utah was canceled in November after costs soared.All the evidence shows that nuclear power is too slow to build, too expensive, and it remains highly polluting and dangerous, Greenpeace EU senior campaigner Lorelei Limousinsaid. We are in a climate emergency, so time is precious, and the governments here today are wasting it with nuclear energy fairy tales.
safe,Sunak will on Monday announce a national endeavour to secure the future of the nuclear submarine-building and nuclear energy industries, creating 40,000 jobs in the process, the prime ministers office said in a statement on Sunday.The government will also partner with industry players, including BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce, EDF and Babcock, to invest at least 763 million pounds ($962m) in skills, jobs and education by 2030, the statement said.The UKs nuclear submarine industry is also set to grow in the coming years following the formation of the AUKUS security pact, under which the UK and the United States are assisting Australia in acquiring nuclear-powered submarines.Thats why we are investing in Barrow, the home of UK submarines, and in the jobs and skills of the future in the thriving British nuclear industry. Today we usher in the next generation of our nuclear enterprise, which will keep us safe, keep our energy secure, and keep our bills down for good.
safe,In an online video from Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation, a cartoon simulation shows a tsunami wiping out one of their future nuclear power stations and cutting off power. What happens next? Not much: The reactor quietly shuts itself down. It cools off just by sitting there, no moving parts or fluids, no operator actions, says the reassuring video. Weve designed a reactor that is inherently safe no matter the events.The Seattle-based Ultra Safe and dozens of other companies like it are at the forefront of a global nuclear energy revival. As the world urgently needs to wean itself off fossil fuels, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and get the planets temperature under control, policymakers, companies and researchers are reexamining nuclear energy as a green alternative that can help bolster the power produced by renewables like wind and solar. Today the industry is emerging from a period of stagnation, with a promise to double or triple its capacity by 2050.That revival is undergirded by two hot technology trends. Companies like Ultra Safe are aiming to build small modular reactors (SMRs) designed to be just a fraction of the size of former plants, to reduce both building costs and the scope of possible disasters. And many are aiming to utilize new technologies designed to make meltdown accidents impossible and to create less long-lived waste.But the surge in interest is not without controversy. As with everything in the nuclear landscape, debate rages about whether society actually needs nuclear to tackle climate change, and whether the new systems are as shiny as they seem  with reasonable arguments for and against every promise and risk. Some say the new technologies could offer a fantastic solution to our energy woes; others say nuclear is beset with so many environmental, social and economic problems that it is best abandoned in favor of other ways to meet the globes energy demands.The next few years will decide what course nuclear power takes in the worlds energy future. This is a moment of truth, says Francesca Giovannini, a nuclear policy expert at the Harvard Kennedy School. Over the next few decades, nuclear power is either going to make it, or that industry is fundamentally done for. ... Its 50/50 how this goes.Nuclear power poses some obvious risks  meltdown accidents, nuclear fuel being diverted to weapons programs, environmental issues posed by mining for uranium, the problems of storing nuclear waste. Against a backdrop of such concerns, alongside shifting economics of energy production, nuclear power production started to level off in the early 2000s and even dipped briefly after the Fukushima power plant accident of 2011. Some nations, most notably Germany, decided to shutter their nuclear programs entirely. But global nuclear power production is now starting to inch upward again.Today, nuclear plants produce about 10 percent of global electricity, making nuclear the second largest source of non-fossil-fuel energy after hydropower. There are about 440 nuclear power plants in operation globally; another 60 or so are now being built, and around 100 are on order or planned.Most Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios for keeping the world below 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming include some kind of increase in nuclear power capacity. In the International Energy Agencys (IEA) pathway to net zero, global nuclear power production doubles over 2022 levels by 2050. A key reason for this is that nuclear is seen as a good way to provide consistent baseload power to prop up more variable renewable sources of energy like wind or solar. Without nuclear, advocates say, we would need to build far more wind and solar power plants to ensure reliable supplies, doubling or tripling costs over power networks that include nuclear.Nuclear has plenty of advantages: It produces no carbon emissions (and, counterintuitively, releases less radioactive uranium and other elements into the environment than burning coal does). It takes up a lot less land than renewables, a not insignificant consideration. If the goal is to decarbonize quickly and with as little social pain as possible, nuclear is essential, says Kai Vetter, a nuclear physicist at the University of California, Berkeley.At the UNs Convention on Climate Change meeting in Dubai in December 2023, more than 20 nations signed a declaration to triple nuclear capacity by 2050. And cash is flowing into this effort. In 2020, the US Department of Energy (DOE) notably gave $160 million for two demonstration plants to get up and running by 2027. And in 2022, the European Union declared that some nuclear projects could call themselves green in the same way as renewables, opening the door to environmental financing mechanisms.But as with almost every issue relating to nuclear power, the arguments in favor of nuclear have their detractors. Public policy expert M.V. Ramana at the University of British Columbia is one of many, for example, who say that baseload power is an outdated concept. A smart, diverse and flexible electric grid, they argue, can assure a reliable power supply by shunting power among sources and storage facilities.Most scenarios for global net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 include a role for nuclear power. Here, projections from the International Energy Agency forecast that the total amount of power from nuclear will need to grow by 2050 to meet needs (left). But because the worlds total energy demand is expected to rise significantly, nuclears share of all power generation may actually fall (right).Then theres the question of safety. The grand total of lives lost from all nuclear power generation to date, while hard to quantify, is certainly far lower than the number of people killed by air pollution related to the burning of fossil fuels; a recent paper by NASA scientists concluded that nuclear power saved roughly 1.8 million lives from 1971 to 2009 thanks to avoided air pollution. By some accounts nuclear power has also proved less deadly than wind power, which has been linked to drownings at offshore wind farm sites and helicopter collisions with turbines.But fatality is arguably a blunt way to measure the impacts of the nuclear industry, which also include the risk of accidents contaminating large tracts of land, plus numerous other effects related to such things as mining and waste storage. Ramana has documented how the burden of these last issues falls disproportionately on Indigenous and disempowered communities, working against the goals of social justice. Nuclear power, he writes, does not fit with any idea of a responsible and cleaner energy system.If we are to pursue nuclear power at the scale called for by the IEA, it will take a herculean effort. The IEAs pathway requires the world to ramp up from building five big nuclear plants per year to 20 per year over the next decade. Big plants typically cost billions of dollars and come with big financial risks. Westinghouse Electric Company, for example, recently filed for bankruptcy in the face of billions of dollars of cost overruns during the construction of four nuclear plants in the United States.One plan for reducing those epic and prohibitive costs is to build small modular reactors, ranging from reactors that can be shipped on a truck and produce a couple of hundred megawatts, to tiny single-megawatt sizes that are more akin to hefty diesel generators. The modules could be pre-built in a factory and shipped to a site for installation. All this should make these reactors less frightening prospects for investors (though the end price per unit of electricity might wind up higher than that from a larger nuclear power plant).A handful of SMRs are already in operation in Russia, China and India. Dozens more are in development. Canada has a national SMR action plan, and as of 2021 there were 10 SMR proposals under review (including one from Ultra Safe).But so far, the promise of enticingly low costs for SMR builds hasnt materialized, says Granger Morgan, a physicist and codirector of the Center for Climate and Energy Decision Making at Carnegie Mellon. Morgan has crunched the numbers for nuclear in the US and was disappointed. I thought SMRs were going to hold much more promise, but we cant make the numbers wash, he says.That message was hammered home in November 2023 when the company NuScale scrapped its high-profile advanced plans to build an underground SMR in Idaho in the face of cost hikes. Would it be nice to have nuclear? Yes absolutely, says Morgan. Will it be affordable? Thats very much an open question.Others argue that small isnt always beautiful. While smaller plants present a smaller risk from smaller potential accidents, this strategy also means more plants overall, which means more facilities to protect against theft and terrorism. You have way more fissile material dispersed; you will have to secure way more infrastructure, says Giovannini. I mean, that becomes a mess.While some are focusing on making nuclear plants smaller, theres a parallel movement to make them safer and more efficient. The next generation of reactor designs  Generation IV, in the industrys lingo  includes a suite of six major reactor families, all very different from todays standard, each with many possible variants under development. Much of the attention (particularly in the US) has been focused on three of these: high-temperature gas-cooled, molten salt and sodium-cooled.The ideas behind these technologies, and even some early-stage power plants, have been around for decades. But the new variants of these old ideas combine novel fuels and designs, promising to be safer, more efficient and environmentally friendly. Theyre doing all kinds of whizz-bang, high-tech stuff, says Morgan, who has no doubt that newer reactors can be made safer than old ones.Most existing reactors are water-cooled uranium systems, which were chosen as the dominant technology largely as a quirk of history. Like all reactor types, they have their pros and cons. They need high pressures to stop their coolant waters from boiling off at typical operating temperatures around 300 degrees Celsius. And they are designed to work with relatively slow-moving neutrons  the subatomic particles that collide with nuclear fuel to initiate nuclear fission. Slow-moving neutrons are more likely to interact with fuel particles, but systems that use them are also limited in the kinds of fuels they can use. Catastrophe can strike if the fission reaction runs amok or the reactor gets too hot and the core melts down, as happened at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima, spewing radiation into the environment.Standard water-cooled reactor designs are vulnerable to catastrophic failures leading to explosions and the meltdown of the reactor core, as happened in 1986 to the Chernobyl reactor shown here. Newer designs may be less vulnerable to this type of unsafe meltdown, advocates say.The latest models of water-cooled reactors (sometimes called Gen III Plus, including many SMRs) use new design tricks to reduce the number of safety systems that require human intervention, aiming to stop accidents in their tracks automatically. Gen IV reactors, though, use entirely different coolant materials, are usually designed to operate at higher, more efficient temperatures, and often use faster-speed neutrons that can convert the most prevalent natural isotopes of uranium into usable fuel, or even feed on nuclear waste.High-temperature gas-cooled reactors, for example, run at temperatures up to 950C, making them 20 to 33 percent more thermally efficient than water-cooled reactors. Since the core materials used in these reactors are typically stable up to 1,600C, which is hotter than lava, theres a large margin of safety. The reactor in Ultra Safes video is an SMR that falls into this category; its small size helps, too, with passive cooling. Ultra Safe also makes their own fuel pellets, encased in a bespoke material that they say retains radioactive materials even in extreme conditions. Theyre hoping to build their first commercial micro-reactor in Canada.In molten salt reactors, both fuel and coolant are already liquid. So meltdowns, in the traditional sense, are impossible. And liquid-sodium-cooled reactors have a built-in safety feature: If they heat up, the liquid sodium expands and allows more neutrons to escape through the gaps between atoms, so the reaction (which is driven by neutrons) naturally winds down. The US Department of Energy has funded the US company TerraPower (which has Bill Gates as a major investor) to build a demonstration plant of its sodium-cooled Natrium reactor in Wyoming by 2030.Waste is one area where the new designs really see some significant improvements, says Giovannini. None of the reactors have entirely solved the problem of nuclear waste, but they do provide some significant solutions in terms of quantity, she says. The spent fuel from traditional light water reactors needs to be buried in special repositories for hundreds of thousands of years, because of the production of long-lived radioactive byproducts. Some Gen IV reactors, on the other hand, can transform spent fuel into more fissile isotopes and use it for further fission reactions. This can improve efficiency and produce waste that need only be stored for hundreds of years.Not everyone, though, thinks all these systems are as shiny as they seem. In 2021, the Union of Concerned Scientists published a report entitled Advanced Isnt Always Better, in which they highlighted issues with safety, sustainability and nuclear proliferation. They concluded that nearly all the Gen IV reactor types fail to provide significant enough improvements over [light water reactors] to justify their considerable risks.The report was criticized by some for being ideologically antinuclear, says Giovannini. But, she says, it was very fair to point out that new tech comes with new worries. Liquid salt, the report pointed out, is corrosive; liquid sodium metal can burst into flame when in contact with water or air. High-temperature gas-cooled reactors, the report concluded, while tolerant of high temperatures, are far from meltdown-proof, as some claim.Many of these Gen IV systems offer another key benefit: Their higher temperatures can provide not just electricity but also useful heat. This could be used in many industrial processes, such as the production of steel, cement and fertilizer, which currently burn a lot of fossil fuels in their furnaces.That heat is pretty much for free, says Vetter, who sees a particular utility for nuclear heat in desalination, getting clean drinking water out of saltwater as is done at the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant in California. Indeed, X-energy, a leading US Gen IV nuclear company funded by the DOE, has partnered with Dow chemical company to build its first high-temperature gas-cooled reactor at a Dow chemical production site by 2030. Morgan, though, thinks that most industries will balk at the set-up costs.Even if Gen IV reactors turn out to be technically superior, though, it may be decades before they can be thoroughly tested, passed by regulators and built at commercial scale. With little time to spare in the fight against climate change, the world might be better off simply ramping up old reactor designs that are already proven, says Esam Hussein, a retired nuclear engineer from the University of Regina, Canada. We have the operating experience, we have the regulatory framework, he says. If the goal is to fight climate change, why dont you go with the devil you know?In response to why we need a devil at all, many are quick to point out that no energy solution is problem-free, including renewables. Giovannini says she agrees with the nuclear industrys criticism that we have jumped on renewables in a very uncritical way. Wind and solar require electronics and battery banks to store their energy; these in turn need elements like lithium and cobalt that can come with environmental and social justice issues from mining. Nothing is 100 percent safe, says Vetter.It is hard for many to swallow data, assurances and statistics about nuclear, given its history and the huge amounts of money at stake. I think the nuclear industry is selling a bunch of bullshit most of the time, says Giovannini, who has been critical of how the industry deals with public concerns. But her own main worry about nuclear is theyre moving too slow. If companies like Ultra Safe, X-Energy, TerraPower and others are going to help fight climate change with Gen IV technologies and fleets of small reactors, she and others say, theyre going to have to ramp up fast.Editors note: This story was updated on March 20, 2024, to change a name: Granger Morgan was referred to as Granger instead of Morgan in one reference. It was updated on March 21, 2024, to correct the specialty of Esam Hussein. He is a retired nuclear engineer, not a retired nuclear physicist.Where will the United States store its nuclear waste? The revised nuclear waste regulatory system must address the entire fuel cycle and consider the different wastes from conventional and next-generation nuclear reactors.Thank you for your interest in republishing!

While smaller plants present a smaller risk from smaller potential accidents, this strategy also means more plants overall, which means more facilities to protect against theft and terrorism. You have way more fissile material dispersed; you will have to secure way more infrastructure, says Giovannini. I mean, that becomes a mess.While some are focusing on making nuclear plants smaller, theres a parallel movement to make them safer and more efficient. The next generation of reactor designs  Generation IV, in the industrys lingo  includes a suite of six major reactor families, all very different from todays standard, each with many possible variants under development. Much of the attention (particularly in the US) has been focused on three of these: high-temperature gas-cooled, molten salt and sodium-cooled.The ideas behind these technologies, and even some early-stage power plants, have been around for decades. But the new variants of these old ideas combine novel fuels and designs, promising to be safer, more efficient and environmentally friendly. Theyre doing all kinds of whizz-bang, high-tech stuff, says Morgan, who has no doubt that newer reactors can be made safer than old ones.Most existing reactors are water-cooled uranium systems, which were chosen as the dominant technology largely as a quirk of history. Like all reactor types, they have their pros and cons. They need high pressures to stop their coolant waters from boiling off at typical operating temperatures around 300 degrees Celsius. And they are designed to work with relatively slow-moving neutrons  the subatomic particles that collide with nuclear fuel to initiate nuclear fission. Slow-moving neutrons are more likely to interact with fuel particles, but systems that use them are also limited in the kinds of fuels they can use. Catastrophe can strike if the fission reaction runs amok or the reactor gets too hot and the core melts down, as happened at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima, spewing radiation into the environment.The latest models of water-cooled reactors (sometimes called Gen III Plus, including many SMRs) use new design tricks to reduce the number of safety systems that require human intervention, aiming to stop accidents in their tracks automatically. Gen IV reactors, though, use entirely different coolant materials, are usually designed to operate at higher, more efficient temperatures, and often use faster-speed neutrons that can convert the most prevalent natural isotopes of uranium into usable fuel, or even feed on nuclear waste.High-temperature gas-cooled reactors, for example, run at temperatures up to 950C, making them 20 to 33 percent more thermally efficient than water-cooled reactors. Since the core materials used in these reactors are typically stable up to 1,600C, which is hotter than lava, theres a large margin of safety. The reactor in Ultra Safes video is an SMR that falls into this category; its small size helps, too, with passive cooling. Ultra Safe also makes their own fuel pellets, encased in a bespoke material that they say retains radioactive materials even in extreme conditions. Theyre hoping to build their first commercial micro-reactor in Canada.In molten salt reactors, both fuel and coolant are already liquid. So meltdowns, in the traditional sense, are impossible. And liquid-sodium-cooled reactors have a built-in safety feature: If they heat up, the liquid sodium expands and allows more neutrons to escape through the gaps between atoms, so the reaction (which is driven by neutrons) naturally winds down. The US Department of Energy has funded the US company TerraPower (which has Bill Gates as a major investor) to build a demonstration plant of its sodium-cooled Natrium reactor in Wyoming by 2030.Waste is one area where the new designs really see some significant improvements, says Giovannini. None of the reactors have entirely solved the problem of nuclear waste, but they do provide some significant solutions in terms of quantity, she says. The spent fuel from traditional light water reactors needs to be buried in special repositories for hundreds of thousands of years, because of the production of long-lived radioactive byproducts. Some Gen IV reactors, on the other hand, can transform spent fuel into more fissile isotopes and use it for further fission reactions. This can improve efficiency and produce waste that need only be stored for hundreds of years.Not everyone, though, thinks all these systems are as shiny as they seem. In 2021, the Union of Concerned Scientists published a report entitled Advanced Isnt Always Better, in which they highlighted issues with safety, sustainability and nuclear proliferation. They concluded that nearly all the Gen IV reactor types fail to provide significant enough improvements over [light water reactors] to justify their considerable risks.The report was criticized by some for being ideologically antinuclear, says Giovannini. But, she says, it was very fair to point out that new tech comes with new worries. Liquid salt, the report pointed out, is corrosive; liquid sodium metal can burst into flame when in contact with water or air. High-temperature gas-cooled reactors, the report concluded, while tolerant of high temperatures, are far from meltdown-proof, as some claim.Many of these Gen IV systems offer another key benefit: Their higher temperatures can provide not just electricity but also useful heat. This could be used in many industrial processes, such as the production of steel, cement and fertilizer, which currently burn a lot of fossil fuels in their furnaces.That heat is pretty much for free, says Vetter, who sees a particular utility for nuclear heat in desalination, getting clean drinking water out of saltwater as is done at the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant in California. Indeed, X-energy, a leading US Gen IV nuclear company funded by the DOE, has partnered with Dow chemical company to build its first high-temperature gas-cooled reactor at a Dow chemical production site by 2030. Morgan, though, thinks that most industries will balk at the set-up costs.Even if Gen IV reactors turn out to be technically superior, though, it may be decades before they can be thoroughly tested, passed by regulators and built at commercial scale. With little time to spare in the fight against climate change, the world might be better off simply ramping up old reactor designs that are already proven, says Esam Hussein, a retired nuclear engineer from the University of Regina, Canada. We have the operating experience, we have the regulatory framework, he says. If the goal is to fight climate change, why dont you go with the devil you know?In response to why we need a devil at all, many are quick to point out that no energy solution is problem-free, including renewables. Giovannini says she agrees with the nuclear industrys criticism that we have jumped on renewables in a very uncritical way. Wind and solar require electronics and battery banks to store their energy; these in turn need elements like lithium and cobalt that can come with environmental and social justice issues from mining. Nothing is 100 percent safe, says Vetter.It is hard for many to swallow data, assurances and statistics about nuclear, given its history and the huge amounts of money at stake. I think the nuclear industry is selling a bunch of bullshit most of the time, says Giovannini, who has been critical of how the industry deals with public concerns. But her own main worry about nuclear is theyre moving too slow. If companies like Ultra Safe, X-Energy, TerraPower and others are going to help fight climate change with Gen IV technologies and fleets of small reactors, she and others say, theyre going to have to ramp up fast.Editors note: This story was updated on March 20, 2024, to change a name: Granger Morgan was referred to as Granger instead of Morgan in one reference. It was updated on March 21, 2024, to correct the specialty of Esam Hussein. He is a retired nuclear engineer, not a retired nuclear physicist.
safe,A next generation nuclear power plant from Bill Gates-founded TerraPower is set to begin construction in Kemmerer, Wyoming this June, according to the Financial Times, marking the start of a larger initiative from the company that aims to bring more affordable and efficient reactors to a competitive nuclear energy market.The demonstration plant will be home to TerraPowers Natrium nuclear reactor, which is cooled with liquid sodium as opposed to water and features a molten salt-based energy storage system, all of which makes for a safer, cheaper and more efficient energy machine that can be built for around half the cost of a water-cooled reactor.The reactor produces 345 megawatts and can have its output boosted to 500 megawatts for more than five-and-a-half hours if need be, which is the equivalent of the energy needed to power around 400,000 homes.TerraPower has secured up to $2 billion in pledges from the U.S. government to complete work on the plant and nearly $1 billion in private funding, in addition to reaching a deal with Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation to explore the exportation of TerraPowers Natrium reactors to the United Arab Emirates.The project is slated for completion in 2030, when it will become a full-scale commercial plant expected to generate 1,600 construction jobs and bring on 250 full-time employees to operate it in Kemmerer, which will receive power from the plant.Nuclear energy has gained increasing popularity as an alternative zero-emission energy source that could help mitigate waste, pollution and carbon footprints associated with fossil fuel sources. In terms of density, one uranium pellet is equal to 17,000 cubic feet of natural gas, 120 gallons of oil and one ton of coal, according to the Department of Energy. Gates founded TerraPower in 2008 with the goal of developing safe and cost-effective nuclear reactors that could fight climate change and meet energy needs. The company fundraised $830 million in 2022 and, in addition to other rivals like publicly traded nuclear energy company NuScale, became involved in a U.S. government push to develop, use and export small, cutting-edge nuclear reactors as a means of competing with Russias hold on the nuclear energy market and Chinas burgeoning nuclear industry.The U.S. government is looking to procure decades-long agreements with other countries for the exportation of small modular reactors, according to the Wall Street Journal, which added the U.S. nuclear reactor sales pitch centers around being a less risky partner than Moscow or Beijing. Its never good if our allies are dependent on a potential adversarial country for energy, Bret Kugelmass, chief executive of nuclear-power startup Last Energy, told the Journal.
safe,Back in November, the US Department of State and the Slovak Ministry of Economy co-hosted the inaugural Project Phoenix Workshop and Launch Event in Bratislava. More than 15 countries from Europe and Eurasia region were there to discuss the goal of building out new nuclear energy capacity  specifically US small nuclear reactors (SMRs) in Eastern Europe and Eurasia.It is argued that these SMRs differ from larger reactors by requiring less fuel, offering more flexibility in location and having the ability to be prefabricated and shipped. Project Phoenix aims to deploy SMRs in Europe and Eurasia, thereby helping countries eventually turn completely away from Russian energy and nuclear know-how. But there are multiple problems with the US scheme. Here are just a few:Nevertheless, the US is pushing the narrative that the deployment of SMRs will help liberate countries from Putins designs for a neo-Soviet empire. The question confronting those Eastern European and Eurasian countries in attendance at the Project Phoenix event is exemplified by Armenia. It draws 40 percent of its energy from its Soviet-era Metsamor nuclear power plant, but has already been issued multiple lifetime extensions. Areg Danagoulian, an associate professor of Nuclear Science and Engineering at MIT, taps into the American narrative as he writes on the Armenian decision:Meanwhile the Armenian government has been busy exploring replacement alternatives, such as possibly US-built small modular reactors (SMRs), seen as a viable replacement. Armenian officials have also entered in discussions with Russia about the possibility of replacing the Soviet-era VVER-440 reactor with the much larger and more modern Russian VVER-1200 design. While the US option is not easymainly because of the lack of readiness of most SMR designsthe Russian option is particularly fraught. Armenia is reluctant to further increase its energy dependence on Russia, given Putins campaign of neo-Soviet expansionism. This is further exacerbated by the technical and economic difficulty of hosting a 1200-megawatt electric VVER-1200 unit on a grid that on average consumes only about 1,000 megawatts.This is a route that the US hopes many Eurasian countries choose, and theyll no doubt get the Europeans to eventually play along (the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia are slated to get the SMRs first  maybe by the mid 2030s), but lets look at the problems with this plan.NuScale Power Cooperation, the first company in the United States to secure approval for the design of a small modular nuclear reactor (SMR), ended its contract with the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS) on Wednesday. The companies cited rising costs as the reason for terminating the contract.Throughout the development process, NuScale made several ill-advised design choices in an attempt to control the cost of its reactor, but which raised numerous safety concerns. The design lacked leak-tight containment structures and highly reliable backup safety systems. It also only had one control room for 12 reactor units despite the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) typically requiring no more than two units per control room. Additionally, the company led efforts to sidestep critical safety regulations, including requirements for offsite emergency response plans to protect nearby communities. But NuScales justification for all this regulatory corner-cuttingthat the design is passively safewas undermined when concerns about its passive emergency core cooling system arose late in the design certification process.Respected thinkers such as former U.S. president Barack Obama, French president Emmanuel Macron, and Microsoft co-founder and philanthropist Bill Gates have toasted the idea of small modular reactors, or SMRs, as a potentially reliable, almost-emissions-free backup to intermittent renewable energy sources like wind and solar. Advocates claim that because SMRs will be smaller than the giants that currently dominate horizons, they will be safer, cheaper, and quicker to build. Although SMRs will have only a fraction of the power-generating capacity of traditional nuclear power reactors, proponents envision that they will, one day, be assembled in factories and transported as a unit to sites  like Sears mail-order Modern Homes of the early 1900sBut SMRs are just as likely to face similar delays and cost overruns. Currently, there are just two existing advanced SMR facilities in the world that could be reasonably described as SMRs: a pilot reactor in China and Russias diminutive Akademik Lomonosov. More small reactors are under construction in China, Russia, and Argentina, but all of them are proving even more expensive per kilowatt than traditional reactors.The US SMR companies rely heavily on subsidies to be economically competitive, and even that wasnt enough for NuScale, which secured $4 billion in federal tax subsidies.Similarly, Project Phoenix is being carried out in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Commerces Small Modular Reactor Public-Private Program, and will no doubt lean heavily on the public side of the ledger.Last year, the US Export-Import Bank and US International Development Finance Corporation issued letters of interest to invest up to $4 billion in Polands SMR development projects, and similar letters have also been offered for Romanian projects.Project Phoenix is partnering with the Three Seas Initiative (3SI)  a politically inspired, commercially driven platform for improving connectivity between thirteen EU Member States allocated between Baltic, Adriatic and Black seas. Led by the US, Germany, and the European Commission, 3SI has an investment fund advised by Amber Infrastructure Group, which promises an attractive return to the investors. The Three Seas Fund was created under Luxembourg law, which means its liable to a subscription tax of 0.01% of the funds net assets and is exempted from the payment of the capital gains tax, income tax, and wealth tax.Started in 2019, 3SI has made a lot of investments, but little actual infrastructure has been built, none of which is a SMR. Involved parties continue to iron out ultimate return on investment calculation.Nearly 50 percent of the worlds uranium enrichment is done by the Russian nuclear energy firm Rosatom, whose subsidiary Tenex is the only company in the world commercially selling Haleu  a high-assay low-enriched uranium that could be a key fuel source for SMRs. More from OilPrice:Firstly, Rosatom is a major exporter of nuclear fuel, providing the U.S. with 14 percent of its uranium in 2021. Meanwhile, utilities across Europe purchased around a fifth of their uranium from Rosatom, and they have been unable to diversify their uranium sources since cutting other energy ties with Russia. Rosatom also provided 28 percent of the U.S.s enrichment services in 2021.Further, Rosatom is not just limited to Russia, holding ownership of several nuclear plants around the world. By the end of 2021, one in five nuclear plants worldwide was either in Russia or was Russian-built. Rosatom has repeatedly stepped in to help finance nuclear plants in countries that want to expand their nuclear power sectors but dont have the money to do so. Many of these plants fall under a build-own-operate model, relying on Rosatom for their operation.The EU, despite 13 sanction packages against Russia, has yet to target its nuclear industry. And according to Euratom Supply Agency, the EU increased imports from Russia of nuclear fuel and services for the blocs Russian-designed reactors again in 2023 compared to 2021. Five countries  Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary and Slovakia  bought 30 percent more conversion services from Russia and 22 percent more enrichment. Even RFE/RL admits the challenges for the US:Westinghouse, an U.S. nuclear power company, is already seeking ways to offer alternative fuel in Europe, but it will take some time to get all the licenses and approvals. In addition, there are concerns that fuel from the United States might be more expensive, and it is unclear how Westinghouse would handle the waste-management system.Nonetheless, Germany, which worsened its energy predicament last year by shutting down its remaining six nuclear power plants, continues to push for EU countries to end their relationship with Russias nuclear industry. If this sounds familiar to the rejection of Russian pipeline natural gas in favor of US LNG, well, it is. And the same players are pushing the envelope. Heres Robert Habeck, the German economy and climate minister:Across the EU, we must keep making ourselves independent from Russia. Habeck added, The nuclear sector is still outstanding. It is not justifiable that this area is still given preferential treatment. Nuclear technology is an extremely sensitive area, and Russia can no longer be seen as reliable partner within it.The only option European countries who rely on Russia for nuclear fuel would be to shutter their plants like Germany did, because despite US-led programs like Project Phoenix and the Three Seas Initiative, theres no one else prepared to step in and fill Russias role for conversion services and enrichment.And even if the US is able to convince European countries and a few Eurasian ones to go with its SMR technology, the only supplier able to provide the fuel on a commercial scale is Russias Tenex. Despite all the money the US is throwing around, little progress is being made, and the reliance on Russia is even causing delays for a company founded by one of the worlds richest individuals:[Bill] Gates has gone so far as to invest a chunk of his fortune in a firm he founded, TerraPower, a leading nuclear innovation company. Gatess TerraPower has an even longer way to go, although it too is cashing in on subsidies. The U.S. Department of Energy has pledged up to $2 billion in matching funds to construct a demonstration plant in Wyoming. Yet TerraPower recently announced its facing delays of at least two years because of difficulties securing uranium fuel from its lone supplier: Russia.The Senates recent border and Ukraine spending package contained more than $2 billion in funds for uranium processing as the Biden administration is gravely concerned about Russias dominance in the field. It seems a little late in the game to be waking to this reality, but thats where the US is. US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm is now calling on Congress to ban uranium supplies from Russia and throw more money at domestic enrichment, but estimates are that it would take at least five years of heavy investment for the US to end its dependence on Russian imports of enriched uranium.Meanwhile, the US imported $1.2 billion worth of Russian uranium last year  an all-time high. Russia is also considered the world leader when it comes to the export of nuclear plant development. It can not only build a plant and provide the fuel, but it often trains local specialists, deals with safety questions, and disposes of the waste. It has recently built or is building reactors in Trkiye, Egypt, Argentina, and has been making a major push into Africa. Rosatom is constructing a Center of Nuclear Science and Technologies in Rwanda, and Ethiopia, Nigeria and Zambia have signed similar deals with Rosatom. Countries such as Ghana, Uganda, Sudan and DRC also have cooperation agreements with Rosatom. There are at least 50 countries that have some level of nuclear cooperation with Russia.The case of Turkiye is illustrative. Ankara had been trying to get a nuclear power plant built for 50 years before signing a deal with Russia in 2010 to build the Akkuyu plant in Turkiye. Back in the 1990s Ankara had bids from Westinghouse + Mitsubishi, AECL, and Framatome + Siemens but had to cancel because it was going to cost more than the Turkish government could afford at the time.Trkiye eventually pivoted to Russias build-own-operate model because it was an arrangement Ankara could afford. Under this arrangement, Russia financed, built, and is delivering the fuel to Akkuyu, which began operations last year. Russia will also handle the waste. For the moment Rosatom owns 75 percent of the shares in the plant, although it reserves the right to sell a project share of not more than 49% to other investors, thus keeping the controlling interest of 51 percent.Trkiyewill buy a fixed proportion of the power at a fixed price of 12.35 /kWh for 15 years. The proportion will be 70 percent of the output of the first two units and 30 percent of that from units 3 and 4 over 15 years. The remainder of the power will be sold by the project company on the open market. After 15 years, when the plant is expected to be paid off, the project company will pay 20 percent of the profits to the Turkish government.Turkish nuclear engineers are also receiving training from the Russians. As the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists says: Given the costs for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the plant, as well as for the management and transport of the waste, this was considered an economically well-negotiated agreement by nuclear energy policy experts. In short, it was a good deal for Turkey.If the US gets its SMR designs ironed out, and really wants to move forward with deploying the reactors, there is another country with a big (and rapidly growing ) presence in nuclear conversion and enrichment (assuming the US doesnt do it itself) that could possibly help the West replace Russian services. Theres another problem there, however. China is also on the enemy list.In current news, the French new generation EPR in Flamanville is incurring yet another delay (albeit very small compared to previous ones), and will not be connected to the electrical network and start producing energy before mid-2024.As an example, France (which has its own enrichment facilities) only performs a first re-processing step with spent fuel, extracting plutonium for its atomic arsenal. The resulting depleted uranium is sent to Rosatom, which transforms it into fuel for nuclear reactors  and stores away the highly-depleted uranium and nasty nucleides that cannot be turned into anything useful for the atomic energy industry.Itll depend. See my comment below. In the cases of some of these SMR technologies  e.g. TerraPower and Oklo  the point of them is that theyre fast breeder reactors, and the Oklo technology only runs on and will recycle used fuel.Basically what is going on across everything. All the dirty industries were exported to Russia and China in order to avoid the environmentalists and the unions demanding changes (or downright closure) that would cut into corporate, and thus stockholder, earnings. Thing is though that said industries are the backbone of the rest of the economy, providing the raw materials and energy for producing all those widgets that keep the masses entertained and docile.In France, the point has been raised that, should the government cancel the contract with Rosatom, then France might have to ready itself for receiving, warehousing, and managing that whole unusable pile of highly-depleted uranium and nasty nucleides resulting from the re-processing of spent fuel from French power plants, but which is for now stored away in Siberia (together with the similar piles from other countries).That bit about NuScale developing a small modular nuclear reactor while cutting every corner that they could was scary stuff. Did they think that the government would just give them a waiver on all this stuff? They were literally building the next Three Mile Island nuclear power plant. And yet they thought that they could get away with it but at least Utah was smart enough to bail. But maybe NuScale Power Cooperations real aim was to just bring in investors and work out how to build those reactors later. Wouldnt be the first time something like that happened.But what gets me is this. You could take Conors excellent post here and use it as a briefing document. Show those in charge that no matter how much they wish to get rid of Russia, it is not going to happen. The world is far too reliant on their expertise and knowledge as they never exported this industrial know-how. And yet all those world leaders just go on pretending that they can get their way by just wishing it. In a better world they would acknowledge the situation and just move on but instead they want all these wild schemes. Maybe we need less lawyers in government and more engineers and no, software engineers do not count. The Chinese leadership has lots of engineers in their ranks and it shows.Rolls-Royces SMR technology (a relatively conventional three-loop pressurized water reactor) is radically different from Gatess TerraPower (a fast reactor where a small enriched fuel core breeds Plutonium-239 in a larger mass of non-fissile but fertile depleted uranium); which is different yet again from Oklo Inc. (a fast micro-reactor running on so-called nuclear waste, or partially used fuel).At the nuclear ages birth there may have been a thousand-plus different designs and directions possible, according to Alvin Weinberg (responsible for the standard Boiling Water Reactor design and the molten-salt reactor). The nuclear plants designs we  got resulted in large measure from nation-states bomb-building programs (see forex Vaos description above of France very limited recycling to extract plutonium for bombs) and, in the US, the prioritization of commercial corporations making profits, which drove the move to a once-through fuel cycle and the introduction of the pernicious concept of nuclear waste.One benefit of global economy is that allows specialization. Reaching the top in a technological field may be simple following a genius, or gradual process of accumulating designs and experience that can loose value if you interrupt activity for, say, ten years and the experts retire or go to other fields. In the second case, the cost of entering the market, or re-entering can be beyond capability of finance dependent private companies.Observing from orbit, it is wasteful to duplicate such efforts. Down on Earth, it is not competitive. Thus key steps in micro-chip production require products of two companies, one Dutch, one German. Russia, a minor miner of titanium, produces the best titanium for aerospace. Japan has best niobium technologies. I guess a long list can be compiled, and quite a few leaders are in USA, but Russia and China have their specialties too. This is the product of globalization after the fall of Soviet Union, as countries could rely on products from anywhere.Difficulties of staying on top are also present in military technologies. For example, Russia had huge problems with drone program that was promising breakthroughs since at least 2015. When it begun to be critical for an actual war, Russia had to exchange key technologies with Iran, to military benefit of both. In the case of peaceful atom, the West somehow dropped the ball, in part of anti-nuclear sentiment in a number of key countries. Back in the day, I thought that France, Japan and Korea will sufficiently preserve their programs, but that does not seem to be the case.Nuclear power is a particularly tough case. I follow news from RosAtom videos, practicing my Russian in the process, so I know some principles they claim. One is to use prototype(s) for 6 years domestically before offering it for export, so development cycle is long, idea, lab testing, then construction, then real life testing, 15 years seems to be minimum. At it does not have to work! RosAtom has a steady stream of military orders, and a national priority  one of the concepts for post-oil Russia. Chinese nuclear program has similarly deep pockets. But the West has several somewhat sketchy programs. Canada promises to test small nuclear power in its Arctic, perhaps it will work. Or not.One can have many conclusions, but one is that the current Western effort of splitting the globe again into blocks that sanction each other to the hilt is dangerous in extreme. It aims to maintain Western monopoly on state of the art in key technology, thus dominating other blocks, preferably broken into individual countries. It will surely delay the transition away from fossil fuels, on top of relatively minor risks like thermonuclear war (the former will surely happen, the latter one can hope will not).If the objective is to produce the most energy for the least inputs (not just fuel, but also all the metals, concrete, and synthetic materials needed for the plant itself), then I do not see the point of SMR  apart from niche applications that is (e.g. those Russian atomic ice-breakers). Which ultimately undermines the economies derived from mass-production.He makes the point that at a new installation with say 8 x 300MW units the first is more per watt than a AP1000. But each successive unit gets faster and labor/time is a huge cost factor and it ends up being faster and less expensive than the larger ones.Bigger may mot be cheaper, but the cumulative effect of building the same thing multiple times for an equivalent output is that inevitably much more duplication of physical material is required  contrary to what you assert. Some things just cant be made any smaller, also duplication of many components at a smaller scale will almost always lead to more material being used than in making one large component. Economy of scale is almost a physical law, and a huge amount of effort would be required to overcome this.In his 2014 book The Colder War, Marin Katusa described in detail RUs primacy in the nuclear energy sector. The wests political leadership wasnt paying attention, and nowten years onthere are still no easy or quick solutions at hand.Changjiang  After a three-hour drive from Sanya, Global Times reporters, along with approximately 200 officials and scholars, arrived at the Changjiang Nuclear Power Plant in South Chinas Hainan Province on Tuesday morning. This facility is the base for the Linglong-1  the worlds first commercial onshore small modular reactor (SMR) to begin construction and pass the IAEA general safety review.Many foreign representatives from the nuclear power industry, particularly from countries keen to introduce nuclear energy, eagerly anticipate this tour. They hope to learn more about this significant example of nuclear energy innovation and evaluate if the Linglong-1 might be a suitable choice for them.Donning long-sleeve shirts, pants, smash-proof shoes, and safety helmets, visitors were ushered to the construction site in groups. Safety warning signs were prominently displayed throughout the site, underscoring the importance of safety during construction.The entire project is slated to commence the installation phase by the end of 2023. With safety and quality thoroughly monitored, the project is set to transition to the debugging stage in the second half of 2024, according to Qu Yong, the deputy-chief-engineer of Hainan Nuclear Power. Earlier in August, the core module was installed within the reactor building of the Linglong-1, also known as ACP100.Im astounded by the organization and efficiency of the project. The project duration is remarkably short! exclaimed Khammar Mrabit, the Director-General of Moroccos Agency for Nuclear and Radiation Safety and Security, after touring the site.Mrabit told the Global Times that China has made significant strides in large, medium, and small nuclear reactors. The ACP100 is definitely an option for Morocco. Were addressing legal and technical challenges to incorporate nuclear energy into our energy mix. Final decisions are still pending.Actually, the ACP100 is quite impressive. Kenya is contemplating establishing a power plant, and SMRs like the ACP100 are among our considerations due to their compact design, shared Collins Owino, an engineer from Kenyas Nuclear Power and Energy Agency, at the construction siteThe worlds first fourth-generation nuclear power plant, Huaneng Shandong Shidao Bay Nuclear Power Plant in eastern Chinas Shandong Province, went into commercial operation on December 6, 2023 and has been running well, according to officials at the plant.The power plant has drawn global attention as it adopts High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor-Pebble-bed Module (HTR-PM), which is claimed to be able to steer away from a meltdown or leak of radioactive materials even in extreme conditions.In the past few weeks of its commercial use, our two reactors in the power unit have maintained the initial full power stable operation. They generate electricity every day with the power of 150 megawatts, said Zhang Yijin, a chief operator at the power plant.I remember a documentary made/seen some decades ago about the birth of ISS. Prior to the fall of USSR, USUK et co have tried to build a space station and after years of trials and boatloads of money (~ 10 bil?) they came up with a small scal model.I worked on the back end of the nuclear fuel process, dealing with spent medium and high waste, and it is clear that without the massive subsidies, nuclear power would cost at least 10 times that of the next most expensive alternative. (Full costing, including disposal)
safe,General Director of Energy, Hydrocarbons, and Mines of El Salvador Daniel Alvarez announced Friday evening on social media that El Salvador had signed the corresponding initial agreements with the IAEA for the peaceful use of nuclear energy.Our task and goal is to decarbonize the energy matrix and boost our countrys development, Alvarezs message read. The use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes is an important starting point and a turning point for our energy sector.Alvarez and Vice Foreign Minister Adriana Mira delivered El Salvadors request documentation to the IAEA during a visit to the agencys headquarters in Vienna, Austria. According to a statement from the Salvadoran Foreign Ministry, IAEA Director Rafael Mariano Grossi asserted that El Salvador is committed to decarbonization, diversifying its energy matrix.The documentation that El Salvador submitted reportedly included the Agreement on Privileges and Immunities of the IAEA, the signing of a Convention on Nuclear Safety, and the signing of the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage.El Salvador is committed to decarbonization, diversifying its energy mix and benefitting from peaceful nuclear applications.

We are not only growing, but we are also doing so in a sustainable way through the diversification of energy sources, Mira wrote on social media.With this initiative, the Government of El Salvador is taking another step towards changing the energy matrix to improve the quality of life of Salvadorans, a statement from the Salvadoran Communications Secretary reportedly read.According to information thatEl Salvadors energy directorate published, 42.4 percent of the nations electricity comes from non-renewable resources, such as liquified gas and crude oil. The rest comes from renewable sources, such as hydroelectric and geothermal power plants, wind turbines, and biomass.Before the recent IAEA application, El Salvador and the Thorium Energy Alliance signed a memorandum of understanding on March 14 for the development of thorium-powered reactors and thermal energy storage systems.El Salvador reportedly increased its energy exports by 86 percent during 2023, amounting to $74.6 million worth of electric power exported to the region, becoming the first supplier of the resource in the Central American market, followed by Panama, Costa Rica, Honduras, and Nicaragua.
safe,Aerial view of brine ponds and processing areas of the lithium mine of the Chilean company SQM (Sociedad Quimica Minera) in the Atacama Desert, Calama, Chile, on September 12, 2022. - The turquoise glimmer of open-air pools meets the dazzling white of a seemingly endless salt desert Latin America's "lithium triangle." A key component of batteries used in electric cars, demand has exploded for the "white gold" found in Argentina, Bolivia and Chile in quantities larger than anywhere else in the world. (Photo by MARTIN BERNETTI/AFP via Getty Images)The world is in sorry shape economically. Its heresy to say it, but one exceedingly productive move that would make the global economy great again would be to take a chainsaw to the immensely wasteful spending on so-called renewables, primarily windmills and solar panels. This would free up money for productive investment to fuel desperately needed economic growth.Post-Covid economies should be surging; instead, most are treading water or sinking. Developing countries are languishing. China says it will expand 5% in 2024, but no one believes Beijings numbers anymore, not with the huge unemployment among young people and a still-troubled property market, once a major engine of growth.President Joe Biden boasts that the U.S. has the best economy in the world, but our performance is substandard by historic standards and unhealthily buttressed by big government spending. Amazingly, given the strange way we calculate GDP, government spending directly boosts it: The more checks Uncle Sam sends out, the higher the GDP number. Washington will shovel out about $7 trillion this financial year, and Biden wants to spend even more next year. These annual outlays exceed the supposed temporary highs during the worst of the Covid crisis. In other words, our subpar performance rests on a destructive, antiproductive investment platform.Countries are drowning in debt. Total debt worldwide is $300 trillion, almost three times the size of the global economy. Slashing spending on alternative energy sources would set loose enormous sums of money to get economies expanding again. This is particularly crucial for poorer nations facing politically toxic stagnation.Renewables are supposed to save the planet by eliminating carbon dioxide emissions. But more and more evidence points to the fact that the massive amounts of minerals needed for such a switch and other environmentally damaging steps in the process end up, at best, a draw with fossil fuels. In other words, were wasting unimaginable amounts of money for nothing.Consider this: In this century, weve spent almost $6 trillion on renewables, and the share of energy worldwide coming from fossil fuels has declined from 86% to only 84%. If all these resources had instead gone into producing new businesses, expanding existing ones, creating new life-enhancing technologies and ensuring safe water for everyone, imagine how much better off the world would be. Or ponder this: Incredibly, Europes carbon dioxide emissions peaked in 1979; those of the U.S. peaked in 2005.There are two surefire clean sources of energy: natural gas and nuclear power. Yet the Biden Administration is throttling the output of natural gas, even though the U.S. is loaded with it. Simultaneously, regulators are stifling exciting advances in nuclear energy, most specifically small modular reactors (SMRs), which are much easier to construct and save considerable time and cost. SMRs can supply power to compact areas like towns, campuses, hospitals and data centers. But government regulations are smothering SMRs by adding immense and unnecessary expenses and delays.

safe,How long must families wait? Its been nearly two months since the House passed a bipartisan expansion of the Child Tax Credit and sent it to the Senate. Estimates are that this bill will benefit 16 million children in families with low incomes, including 5.8 million kids under the age of six.You would think that in an election year, Congress would be eager to pass a tax cut for families (and small businesses). But a few senators are blocking it for political gain. Families should not have to wait months for Congress to pass something that is both popular and necessary.Yet, as millions upon millions cross our borders, the consequences of their plan is placing our people, and our nation, in grave danger. Contained within them are serious criminals and terrorists who want to destroy our country. We are also accepting the deaths of over 100,000 per year of our people from fentanyl.The recent release of Apple TVs ten-part documentary on the New England Patriots success was more an issue with team owner Robert Kraft finding fault with Coach Bill Belichick and blaming him for the team not returning to the Super Bowl in recent years.Coach Belichick took the Patriots to seven Super Bowls winning six, a feat that may never be achieved by another National Football League team but Kraft takes the low road with his anti-Belichick post-dynasty blame game. He deflects the blame for the recent seasons downturn onto anyone but himself as the owner.Our government is willing to pour money into unreliable solar and wind energy. Can you spell Solyndra? Nuclear energy is clean, safe and reliable. The hysteria that swirls around nuclear power is misguided. The technology required to build small, efficient, nuclear plants exists now. Nuclear energy needs to be a larger source of power for Americas growth. Government subsidies that are propping up solar and wind power are making some people rich but does not provide enough energy to make the US energy independent. Nuclear energy is a viable alternative to fossil fuel and should be a growing industry.
safe,Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will set out plans to boost Britain's nuclear workforce on Monday, as increased submarine building and the growing needs of the nuclear energy industry are forecast to create 40,000 new jobs by 2030.The government will partner with defense companies BAE Systems, Rolls-Royce and Babcock plus energy giant EDF to invest more than 763 million pounds ($961 million) by the end of the decade in skills, jobs and education, it said in a statement.The government needs to ensure there are sufficient nuclear workers to help build and maintain its fleet of submarines, vital for defense and security as they are the basis of the UK's continuous at-sea nuclear deterrent."Safeguarding the future of our nuclear deterrent and nuclear energy industry is a critical national endeavor," said Sunak, who will on Monday visit Barrow-in-Furness in the northwest, where Britain's nuclear submarine industry is based.Further details on how Britain will deliver the capabilities necessary for to maintain its nuclear deterrent will be published by defense secretary Grant Shapps on Monday in the "Defencse Nuclear Enterprise Command Paper", Sunak's office said.As part of it plans to boost the nuclear workforce, the government said it will invest 200 million pounds in Barrow over the next decade to help support people into jobs, improve the area's transport infrastructure and build more homes.

I don't know how you solve this problem, but the residents are right to be skeptical when someone in authority tell them everything is OK.Is that actually the IAEA's job, though? Randomly, constantly, and uninvitedly Inspecting and analyzing each and every of the world's 440-something power plants' internals to the point where they can find flaws in structural features like the one that led to the Fukushima disaster?The need to wear mask and protective gear in an area were hazzarous material is being handeled does not necesary mean that the resulting product (in this specific case, water with residual Tritium) is harmful.Just thinking by 5 seconds, you sould understand that despite being in a radioactive hazzard area, the "protective gear" is minimum... just protective glasses, a mask and pair of cloath globes. The other  items like a helmet and the blue garment are more for general head protection and identification.The need to wear mask and protective gear in an area were hazzarous material is being handeled does not necesary mean that the resulting product (in this specific case, water with residual Tritium) is harmful.Grossi last visited the plant in July after issuing an IAEA review predicting only negligible impact from the discharges. An IAEA comprehensive report later concluded that the discharges meet international safety standards.Grossi last visited the plant in July after issuing an IAEA review predicting only negligible impact from the discharges. An IAEA comprehensive report later concluded that the discharges meet international safety standards.As in the previous rounds, Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc. will discharge 7,800 tons of treated water over about 17 days, having confirmed that the radioactivity level of the latest batch of water meets the standards set by the government and the utility.https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2024/02/7b89da33fd65-4th-release-of-fukushima-treated-radioactive-water-begins.html#:~:text=The%20operator%20of%20the%20crippled,the%20fiscal%20year%20ending%20March.From this round on, the operator will forgo the step of temporarily storing the treated water in a large tank to check the tritium level before release. It will check the level as the water flows through pipes, as it did in the past three rounds.Japanese authorities betrayed formal agreement with fisher people, disregarded option that can avoid dumping treated but still contaminated water, ignored that many kinds of radioactivity contain after even filtering, and escaped to consider about bioconcentration risk.Good to see this reassurance, showing the validity of the plan, and Japan's transparency. It still won't be enough to stop China's seafood ban, though, as we all know that's 100% politics and 0% science.
safe,On March 25 and 26, Russias resort city of Sochi hosts the 13th international ATOMEXPO exhibition and forum. The event is focused on the expansion of advanced nuclear technologies in Russia and worldwide in a bid to boost energy independence, achieve a sustainable and safe environment, and secure high living standards.Russia, one of the worlds largest nuclear energy producers, has long been known for its outstanding experience in the atomic industry and currently dominates the global nuclear supply chain. It has a fleet of 36 reactors, and 19 reactors operating overseas  the largest number globally and, despite growing pressure from the EU and the US, it maintains a strong global influence in nuclear power. Many countries rely on atomic know-how from Russia to run their power plants.In 14 years, ATOMEXPO has transformed itself from a Russian nuclear industry event with occasional participation from foreign partners into a global nuclear industry discussion platform. The forum is designed to promote the nuclear industry and provide business opportunities for domestic and international companies.This years forum will be record-breaking both in terms of the total number of countries participating in ATOMEXPO  nearly 80, and in terms of newcomer countries  about 10. Were also going to see record figures in the number of ministers and foreign companies taking part in the event, said Aleksey Likhachev, the head of Russias atomic energy agency, Rosatom.The agenda of the ATOMEXPO 2024 includes global issues such as carbon-free energy, responsible approaches to the environment and natural resources, green investments, and international partnership for sustainable development. It has attracted more than 4,500 delegates and guests, bringing together executives from major Russian and international companies in the sector, government agencies, research and scientific organizations, and prominent nuclear industry experts.Special guests and participants include deputy director general and head of the Department of Nuclear Energy at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Mikhail Chudakov; Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto; Burundis Minister of Hydraulics, Energy and Mines Ibrahim Uwizeye; and Serbian Health Minister Danica Grujicic. The forum will host 40 round-table events and business sessions.ATOMEXPO features a plenary session dedicated to clean energy prospects, highlighting the importance of nuclear power in decarbonizing the worlds energy sector. As the biggest low-carbon source of electricity, nuclear energy is widely seen as a possible solution to global energy challenges and a path to overcoming the climate crisis.The rapid development of renewable power and its increase in the energy mix of countries worldwide creates new opportunities for the energy industry. Nuclear and hydropower generation provides a sustainable low-carbon power production ensuring energy security and safety. Its also cheaper than conventional sources of energy such as oil and gas.Nuclear technology continues to advance with fourth-generation nuclear reactors that could dramatically change the entire energy industry, mainly due to their safety and a significant reduction of radioactive waste.Fourth-generation nuclear technology refers to a new class of advanced reactors called small modular reactors (SMRs). They are designed to be safer, more efficient, and more sustainable than previous generations.In January, Russia announced the start of a landmark construction of the worlds first new generation-IV lead-cooled fast reactor of closed nuclear fuel cycle technology at the site of the Siberian Chemical Combine in Seversk, southwest Siberia. A closed nuclear fuel cycle means spent fuel is reprocessed and partly reused.Green hydrogen will also feature at ATOMEXPO. Generated from renewable energies, hydrogen has emerged as one of the strongest candidates for helping to decarbonize economic sectors dependent on emissions-intensive fossil fuels, including oil, gas and coal, taking the world a step closer to carbon neutrality. Its potential for many different uses makes green hydrogen a highly promising alternative for sectors where direct electrification or other low-carbon options might not be technically or economically feasible, for example in the steelmaking, chemical and refinery industries, and heavy transportation by land, air and sea.There is growing demand for lithium worldwide since it is used to make lithium-ion batteries, vital for most consumer electronics, as well as electric vehicles (EV). High demand for lithium is largely driven by the rapid development of electric cars. Following the exodus of European, American, and Japanese car manufacturers, Russia has embarked on the major development of its domestic automobile industry, focusing on EVs as they have fewer parts and are easier to produce. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov said last year that Russias lithium reserves and processing capacity would cover domestic and export demand by 2030.
safe,Shortly after the magnitude-9 earthquake struck on March 11, a series of tsunamis inundated four of the reactor buildings and set off a chain reaction in three reactors that resulted in the release of significant amounts of radioactivity into the environment.The challenge in recent years has been to gather the large amounts of nuclear fuel that escaped from the reactors in order to halt the release of more radiation something that had never been attempted before and has to be carried out in buildings where radioactive contamination remains dangerously elevated and where debris from the tsunami and subsequent hydrogen explosions still litters the area.Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO), the operator of the plant, has estimated that work to make the plant safe will take between 30 and 40 years, but recent reports on progress at the site have been largely negative.In January, TEPCO announced that it would have to delay plans to commence in March the test use of a robotic arm to remove radioactive material from the No. 2 reactor. The initial plan called for tests using the robotic limb to take place in 2021 but were delayed by technical glitches.Other areas of the project have also experienced challenges, with the first drones and a robot sent into the No. 1 reactor building earlier this month also suffering faults. The drones and robothad to be withdrawn before they could complete their mission to locate molten fuel debris that has leaked from the reactor and to map other damage."Based on the roadmap and the Nuclear Regulation Authority's 'Risk Map,'the decommissioning steps to be taken over the next 10 years have been compiled in the mid-and-long term decommissioning action plan, which is periodically revised in light of decommissioning progress and the emergence of new issues that need to be addressed,"TEPCO said.The company is also keen to point out its achievements, including the complete removal of spent nuclear fuel from units three and four at the site, a sharp reduction in the amount of water seeping into the chambers beneath the reactors and becoming contaminated with radiation as well as the successful treatment of radioactive water below according to standards set by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) before it is released into the Pacific Ocean.Vincent Gorgues, the chief of staff to the French High Commissioner for Nuclear Energy and presently one of three international special advisors to Japan's Nuclear Damage Compensation and Decommissioning Facilitation Corp, told DW that progress to date has been overwhelmingly positive, despite the countless challenges."Nuclear projects are complex,"he said. "Among them, decommissioning projects are highly singular and offer a higher level of difficulty, due mainly to the level of uncertainty about the initial state of the facility and to difficulties in managing safely all the radioactive waste streams.""Even today, access to the reactor buildings is very difficult and requires fully remotely operated means of intervention, while carrying out investigations and having a precise idea of what needs to be done, even before considering how to do it, is a huge challenge in itself,"Gorgues said.In addition, each of the three crippled reactors has its own set of specific challenges and there is no disposal site for the highly radioactive nuclear waste that must be recovered from the site, he pointed out.The key steps now are to remove all the spent nuclear fuel, whether intact or leaked, from inside reactor buildings one and two, and the retrieval and disposal of fuel debris from the partial core meltdowns.Gorgues said he favors speeding up the release of treated water from the plant in order to dismantle the hundreds of storage tanks that presently occupy much of the site, with that land needed for new waste treatment and storage facilities.The expert also played down suggestions that TEPCO would likely not be able to stick to its declared timeline for the decommissioning process, emphasizing that the three- or four-decade schedule is "a target"rather than a deadline."This is not a race, but a structured, careful,stepwise approach, which at every stage requires you to take time, determine the best strategy and guarantee both short-term and long-term safety,"Gorgues said, adding that the radiological conditions "are extremely hostile.""This indicative timeframe of 30 to 40 years had two communication goals: to show that it would take a long time; but also to show that the timeframe would remain commensurable with one professional career and that the burden would not be passed on over several generations. It is in that spirit that we must consider this target.""I would like to stress, however, that these delays have remained minor and that most of what was announced has been achieved,"he said. "In my opinion, and under these conditions, what has already been done is a remarkable achievement."
safe,The plant is located on the Dnipro River in eastern Ukraine and Ukrainian forces occupy the bank opposite, leaving it "in the sights of both sides' militaries", said The Guardian. Ukraine and Russia have blamed each other for shelling that has downed power lines."Captured by the Russian invaders" in the early stages of the war in March 2022, the "vast" Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant has been "on the frontline of the war ever since", added the paper. All six of its reactors are shut down, but it still needs "constant power" to keep fuel in those reactors cool and prevent a "potentially catastrophic meltdown", said Reuters.Russia initially wanted to connect the reactors to its own energy grid but that plan was abandoned, said The Guardian. "But recent comments from officials have suggested a new attempt to restart nuclear energy generation may take place later this year."In December, Yuriy Chernichuk, the Russian-appointed director of the site, told the plant's staff newsletter that 2024 is an "anniversary year for the station and the station is determined to work at full capacity".But Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), warned that "any such action would require a number of considerations", including that it is "an active combat zone" and that "this plant has been in shutdown for a prolonged period of time", said The Straits Times.Shaun Burnie, a nuclear specialist with Greenpeace Germany, said that "no nuclear regulations exist anywhere in the world that permit a nuclear plant to operate on the frontline in an active war zone".The pressure group also said that there was concern over whether Rosatom, the Russian state-owned energy provider now running the plant, could ensure there was enough cooling water available to safely operate even a single reactor.In the IAEA's fourth resolution condemning Russia's actions against Ukrainian nuclear facilities, it called for the "urgent withdrawal of all unauthorized military and other unauthorized personnel" and for the plant to be "immediately returned to the full control of the competent Ukrainian authorities".There are no signs of Russia adhering to the request, but in a meeting with Grossi earlier this month, Putin did acknowledge that "it is very important, on a planetary scale" to ensure "nuclear energy safety and compliance with safety standards throughout the world". The talks between the two men were described as "tense" by the RIA Novosti news agency, but a spokesperson for the IAEA denied the description.Greenpeace accused Grossi of complacency, and insisted restarting any of the reactors should be comprehensively ruled out. The IAEA "must not play the role of pretend regulator" in "overseeing a Russian nuclear timebomb", said a spokesperson, but instead "must make clear that safe operation is impossible".Chas Newkey-Burden has been part of The Week Digital team for more than a decade and a journalist for 25 years, starting out on the irreverent football weekly 90 Minutes, before moving to lifestyle magazines Loaded and Attitude.

safe,Holtec International acquired the 800-megawatt Palisades plant in 2022 with plans to dismantle it. But now the emphasis is on restarting it by late 2025, following support from the state of Michigan and the Biden administration.Governor Gretchen Whitmer said it would be the first nuclear power plant to be reopened in the United States. It still faces hurdles, including inspections, testing, and the blessing of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, known as the NRC.Nuclear power is our single largest source of carbon-free electricity, directly supporting 100,000 jobs across the country and hundreds of thousands more indirectly, said Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, a former Michigan governor.The Palisades plant is along Lake Michigan, a two-hour drive from Chicago. A Michigan utility, CMS Energy, owned it from 1971 until the plant was sold to Louisiana-based utility Entergy in 2007. It was shut down in 2022.The repowering of Palisades will restore safe, around-the-clock generation to hundreds of thousands of households, businesses, and manufacturers, said Kris Singh, Holtec president and chief executive.Nuclear energy is in the spotlight. Thirty-four countries, including the United States, last week pledged to use it to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. In California, regulators in December said the Diablo Canyon plant could operate through 2030 instead of 2025 to guard against blackouts as the state shifts toward renewable power sources. Owner Pacific Gas & Electric said federal aid helped it repay a state loan.There is more enthusiasm toward nuclear power  in Congress, in the industry, and also internationally, said Najmedin Meshkati, an engineering professor at the University of Southern California who has inspected nuclear plants around the world.It puts the onus and burden on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Holtec to double down on efforts to make sure this plant is safe enough and all the safety measures are intact, Meshkati said of Palisades.

(Robert Hunziker)Nuclear radiation which threatens life on planet earth is not front page news in comparison to the most insignificant issues of public concern, including the local level crime scene or the tabloid gossip reports on Hollywood celebrities.While the long-term repercussions of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster are yet to be fully assessed, they are far more serious than those pertaining to the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in the Ukraine, which resulted in almost one million deaths (New Book Concludes  Chernobyl death toll: 985,000, mostly from cancer Global Research, September 10, 2010, See also Matthew Penney and Mark Selden The Severity of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster: Comparing Chernobyl and Fukushima, Global Research, May 25, 2011)Moreover, while all eyes were riveted on the Fukushima Daiichi plant, news coverage both in Japan and internationally failed to fully acknowledge the impacts of a second catastrophe at TEPCOs (Tokyo Electric Power Co Inc) Fukushima Daini nuclear power plant.An opinion poll in May 2011 confirmed that more than 80 per cent of the Japanese population do not believe the governments information regarding the nuclear crisis. (quoted in Sherwood Ross, Fukushima: Japans Second Nuclear Disaster, Global Research, November 10, 2011)The Japanese government has been obliged to acknowledge that the severity rating of its nuclear crisis  matches that of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. In a bitter irony, however, this tacit admission by the Japanese authorities has proven to be part of the cover-up of a significantly larger catastrophe, resulting in a process of global nuclear radiation and contamination:While Chernobyl was an enormous unprecedented disaster, it only occurred at one reactor and rapidly melted down. Once cooled, it was able to be covered with a concrete sarcophagus that was constructed with 100,000 workers. There are a staggering 4400 tons of nuclear fuel rods at Fukushima, which greatly dwarfs the total size of radiation sources at Chernobyl. ( Extremely High Radiation Levels in Japan: University Researchers Challenge Official Data, Global Research, April 11, 2011)Hazardous radioactive elements being released in the sea and air around Fukushima accumulate at each step of various food chains (for example, into algae, crustaceans, small fish, bigger fish, then humans; or soil, grass, cows meat and milk, then humans). Entering the body, these elements  called internal emitters  migrate to specific organs such as the thyroid, liver, bone, and brain, continuously irradiating small volumes of cells with high doses of alpha, beta and/or gamma radiation, and over many years often induce cancer. (Helen Caldicott, Fukushima: Nuclear Apologists Play Shoot the Messenger on Radiation, The Age, April 26, 2011)While the spread of radiation to the West Coast of North America was casually acknowledged, the early press reports (AP and Reuters) quoting diplomatic sources stated that only tiny amounts of radioactive particles have arrived in California but do not pose a threat to human health. Greg Jaczko, chair of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, told White House reporters on Thursday (March 17) that his experts dont see any concern from radiation levels that could be harmful here in the United States or any of the U.S. territories.What prevails is a well organized camouflage. The public health disaster in Japan, the contamination of water, agricultural land and the food chain, not to mention the broader economic and social implications, have neither been fully acknowledged nor addressed in a comprehensive and meaningful fashion by the Japanese authorities.Japan as a nation state has been destroyed. Its landmass and territorial waters are contaminated. Part of the country is uninhabitable. High levels of radiation have been recorded in the Tokyo metropolitan area, which has a population of 39 million (2010) (more than the population of Canada, circa 34 million (2010)) There are indications that the food chain is contaminated throughout Japan:Radioactive cesium exceeding the legal limit was detected in tea made in a factory in Shizuoka City, more than 300 kilometers away from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Shizuoka Prefecture is one of the most famous tea producing areas in Japan.A tea distributor in Tokyo reported to the prefecture that it detected high levels of radioactivity in the tea shipped from the city. The prefecture ordered the factory to refrain from shipping out the product. After the accident at the Fukushima nuclear power plant, radioactive contamination of tea leaves and processed tea has been found over a wide area around Tokyo. (See 5 More Companies Detect Radiation In Their Tea Above Legal Limits Over 300 KM From Fukushima, June 15, 2011)Japans industrial and manufacturing base is prostrate. Japan is no longer a leading industrial power. The countrys exports have plummeted. The Tokyo government has announced its first trade deficit since 1980.While the business media has narrowly centered on the impacts of power outages and energy shortages on the pace of productive activity, the broader issue pertaining to the outright radioactive contamination of the countrys infrastructure and industrial base is a scientific taboo(i.e the radiation of industrial plants, machinery and equipment, buildings, roads, etc).A report released in January 2012 points to the nuclear contamination of building materials used in the construction industry, in cluding roads and residential buildings throughout Japan.(See FUKUSHIMA: Radioactive Houses and Roads in Japan. Radioactive Building Materials Sold to over 200 Construction Companies, January 2012)A coverup report by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (May 2011), entitled Economic Impact of the Great East Japan Earthquake and Current Status of Recovery presents Economic Recovery as a fait accompli.The impacts of nuclear radiation on the work force and the countrys industrial base are not mentioned. The report states that the distance between Tokyo -Fukushima Dai-ichiis of the order of 230 km (about 144 miles) and that the levels of radiation in Tokyo are lower than in Hong Kong and New York City. (Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, Impact of the Great East Japan Earthquake and Current Status of Recovery, p.15).This statement is made without corroborating evidence and in overt contradiction with independent radiation readings in Tokyo (see map below). In recent developments, Sohgo Security Services Co. is launching a lucrative radiation measurement service targeting households in Tokyo and four surrounding prefectures.A map of citizens measured radiation levels shows radioactivityis distributed in a complex pattern reflecting the mountainous terrain and the shifting winds across a broad area of Japan north of Tokyo which is in the center of the of bottom of the map.Radiation limits begin to be exceeded at just above 0.1 microsieverts/ hour blue. Red is about fifty times the civilian radiation limit at 5.0 microsieverts/hour. Because children are much more sensitive than adults, these results are a great concern for parents of young children in potentially affected areas.The fundamental question is whether the vast array of industrial goods and components Made in Japan  including hi tech components, machinery, electronics, motor vehicles, etc  and exported Worldwide are contaminated? Were this to be the case, the entire East and Southeast Asianindustrial base which dependsheavily on Japanesecomponents and industrial technology would be affected.The potential impacts on international trade would be farreaching. In this regard, in January, Russian officials confiscated irradiated Japanese automobiles and autoparts in the port of Vladivostok for sale in the Russian Federation. Needless to say, incidents of this nature in a global competitive environment, could lead to the demise of the Japanese automobile industrywhich is already in crisis.While most of the automotive industry is in central Japan, Nissans engine factory in Iwaki city is 42 km from the Fukushima Daiichi plant. Is the Nissan work force affected? Is the engine plant contaminated? The plant is within about 10 to 20 km of the governments evacuation zone from which some 200,000 people were evacuated (see map below).Nuclear energy is not a civilian economic activity. It is an appendage of the nuclear weapons industry which is controlled by the so-called defense contractors. The powerful corporate interests behind nuclear energy and nuclear weapons overlap.In Japan at the height of the disaster, the nuclear industry and government agencies [were] scrambling to prevent the discovery of atomic-bomb research facilities hidden inside Japans civilian nuclear power plants.1 (See Yoichi Shimatsu, Secret Weapons Program Inside Fukushima Nuclear Plant? Global Research, April 12, 2011)In both cases, the devastating health impacts of nuclear radiation are casually denied. Tactical nuclear weapons with an explosive capacity of up to six times a Hiroshima bomb are labelled by the Pentagon as safe for the surrounding civilian population.Such an action would result in the unthinkable: a nuclear holocaust over a large part of the Middle East and Central Asia. A nuclear nightmare, however, would occur even if nuclear weapons were not used.Disclaimer: The contents of this article are of sole responsibility of the author(s).

safe,Matthew Szydagis, 41, has spent the last two years toiling in a laboratory deep beneath the University of Albany campus, blasting bits of lithium with ion beams to test the nature of its fission reactions.The physics professor discovered that lithium, commonly used in cellphone batteries used in phones, cars, and other technologies, only becomes fissionable when hit by the ions  and stabilizes when the beams stop.The concept is to have fission that you can turn on and turn off, Szydagis told The Post. Thats what really creates the incredible safety factor and makes it completely different from standard nuclear power.All of our nuclear power plants were created after the Manhattan Project and after the bomb. So the only way we knew how to make nuclear energy was to take the same technology and same ideas from bombs, Szydagis said, explaining that uranium has remained the standard fuel in nuclear plants throughout their history.Szydagis model could also potentially negate the dangers of uranium waste created from standard nuclear reactors. Unlike uranium, which can take almost a billion years to no longer be radioactive, fissioned lithium takes a matter of hours, minutes, worst case days or weeks to become safe.Though only tested on small samples so far, if Szydagis lithium-based model scales as he expects it would have the potential to replace uranium in reactors across the world  and possibly eliminate the public safety fears that have prevented the clean energy source from powering the entire planet.The beauty of nuclear power  any nuclear power, my idea as well as traditional uranium-based plants  is that they can be built with nearly zero carbon footprint and run with nearly zero CO2 output, he said.Szydagis believes that a climate change cataclysm has already begun and estimates that New York City will be underwater by 2100 if nothing is done to prevent it. However, if successful, his lithium-based nuclear energy could have an enormous impact on keeping future generations safe.Ill put it very bluntly  someone sitting in New York may not end up underwater anymore in 50 years if his idea succeeds, he explained. So I would say thats a pretty big impact: to not have Manhattan become the next lost city of Atlantis.Dark matter hunters spend their time creating neutrons to throw at detectors  something the University of Albanys subterranean particle collider is uniquely equipped for  and during such experimentation with his team Szydagis struck on the lithium idea.The process remains in its early stages. Szydagis has a patent pending and is looking for funding to expand the size of his experiments, which he will then write up into a paper for peer review and then look at further expansion.Im not claiming any new physics. Im not saying Ive got some crackpot zero point energy or some magical thing that doesnt actually exist  Im doing bread and butter, nuclear fission thats been understood for many, many decades.
safe,Holtec International acquired the 800-megawatt Palisades plant in 2022 with plans to dismantle it. But now the emphasis is on restarting it by late 2025, following support from the state of Michigan and the Biden administration.Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said it would be the first nuclear power plant to be reopened in the U.S. It still faces hurdles, including inspections, testing and the blessing of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, known as the NRC.Nuclear power is our single largest source of carbon-free electricity, directly supporting 100,000 jobs across the country and hundreds of thousands more indirectly, said Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, a former Michigan governor.The Palisades plant is along Lake Michigan, a two-hour drive from Chicago. A Michigan utility, CMS Energy, owned it from 1971 until the plant was sold to Louisiana-based utility Entergy in 2007. It was shut down in 2022.The repowering of Palisades will restore safe, around-the-clock generation to hundreds of thousands of households, businesses and manufacturers, said Kris Singh, Holtec president and chief executive.Nuclear energy is in the spotlight. Thirty-four countries, including the U.S., last week pledged to use it to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. In California, regulators in December said the Diablo Canyon plant could operate through 2030 instead of 2025 to guard against blackouts as the state shifts toward renewable power sources.There is more enthusiasm toward nuclear power  in Congress, in the industry and also internationally, said Najmedin Meshkati, an engineering professor at the University of Southern California who has inspected nuclear plants around the world.It puts the onus and burden on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Holtec to double down on efforts to make sure this plant is safe enough and all the safety measures are intact, Meshkati said of Palisades.FORTUNE is a trademark of Fortune Media IP Limited, registered in the U.S. and other countries.

The result keeps the Democratic Progressive Party, which broadly favors Taiwanese sovereignty and closer ties with the United States, at the helm of government for a third consecutive term. Although managing relations with Beijing garners the most international attention, perhaps no problem will be more vexing to the DPP than Taiwans energy situation, which is precarious.After a contested race, the people of Taiwan have elected current Vice President Lai Ching-te to be their next president. The result keeps the Democratic Progressive Party, which broadly favors Taiwanese sovereignty and closer ties with the United States, at the helm of government for a third consecutive term. Although managing relations with Beijing garners the most international attention, perhaps no problem will be more vexing to the DPP than Taiwans energy situation, which is precarious.Taiwan imports 97 percent of its energy through highly vulnerable maritime shipping routes. Any quarantine, blockade, or invasion of the island by China would devastate its ability to sustain basic services and critical infrastructurenot to mention the factories that produce approximately 90 percent of the worlds most advanced semiconductors. At the moment, best estimates suggest that Taiwans strategic energy stockpiles contain only enough natural gas to last 11 days and enough coal to last 39 days. Even though Taipei acknowledges these vulnerabilities, solutions are in short supply.Taiwan was not always so energy dependent; just a few decades ago, it was a major producer of nuclear energy. During the mid-1980s, nuclear power accounted for roughly half of the islands electricity consumption. At the time, Taiwan had six operable reactors, with plans to build more. But in the last two decades, Taipei has reduced its reliance on nuclear energy, and the DPP, which rose to prominence during nuclear powers heyday on an anti-nuclear wave, played a key role in this shift. When the party won the presidency in 2016, it pledged to phase out nuclear power entirely. If Lai fulfills the promises of his predecessor, the islands final two reactors will go offline by next year.Considering its location in one of the worlds most contentious bodies of water and its fraught relationship with Beijing, Taiwans resistance to what was once a dependable domestic source of power may seem puzzling. For Taipei, however, its complicated. Lais impending choice of whether to preserve or abandon the nuclear option will be informed by a long and lesser-known history of proliferation, espionage, disaster, and democratization.Taipeis interest in all things nuclear began during the early days of the atomic age. In December 1949, after years of civil war with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), Gen. Chiang Kai-shek relocated Nationalist forces to the island of Taiwan, where he established a dictatorship under Kuomintang (KMT) party rule. Chiang did not, however, abandon ambitions to recapture the mainland, and as the general consolidated power, he saw nuclear technology as a means of acquiring international prestige and geopolitical advantage. Although there were internal disagreements over whether Taipei should immediately move to acquire nuclear weapons, the government began building latent capabilities under the guise of civilian projects.In 1955, Taiwan and the United States reached an agreement for cooperation on the peaceful uses of atomic energy that kick-started Taiwans nuclear program, allowing the KMT government to obtain key technologies and send scientists and military personnel abroad for training and education. Although Taipei officially renounced nuclear weapons in exchange for Washingtons assistance with civilian projects, in practice leaders hedged their bets, cultivating expertise that could be directed toward other ends.Taiwans covert nuclear weapons program began in earnest following Chinas first successful nuclear test in 1964. The test shattered Taiwans sense of security. Although the United States had committed itself to Taiwan in the 1955 Mutual Defense Treaty, the KMT government feared abandonment, especially after the White House rebuffed its calls to strike mainland Chinese nuclear facilities. Leaders also worried that proliferation would bolster Beijings status in the international community at Taipeis expense. Once Beijing crossed this threshold, the KMT government doubled down on its own nuclear weapons program. To spearhead these efforts, leaders established the Institute of Nuclear Energy Research, which was closely linked to the militaryalthough the government publicly insisted that its activities were exclusively civilian.In 1969, Taiwan purchased a natural uranium-fueled, heavy water-moderated research reactor, known as the Taiwan Research Reactor, from Canada. (This kind of reactor is conducive to the production of weapons-grade plutonium.) From there, the government tried to acquire other critical technologies, including plutonium reprocessing facilities, from foreign suppliersalthough Washington, increasingly suspicious of Taipeis intentions, thwarted many of these sales. Nevertheless, Taiwans weaponization research and indigenous capabilities progressed, albeit at a smaller scale and slower pace than originally planned.Despite its covert plans, Taiwan signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1968 and ratified it in 1970, likely hoping to generate goodwill from the international community. But in 1971, the U.N. recognized the Peoples Republic of China, based on the mainland, as the only legitimate representatives of China, kicking Taiwan, otherwise known as the Republic of China, out of the multilateral body. By extension, Taiwan lost its membership in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and International Atomic Energy Association, compounding the governments anxieties about declining international support. This decision also made it harder for the international community to monitor the islands nuclear facilities and enforce nonproliferation norms, precisely as nuclear weapons became more appealing for both status and security reasons. Taiwans concerns became even more acute after then-U.S. President Richard Nixons historic visit to China in 1972.As its weapons program took off, Taiwan also began building nuclear power plants. The KMT had ambitious plans to transform the island into a modern, industrial economy, but the 1973 oil crisis demonstrated the perils of Taiwans lack of indigenous energy resources. Nuclear energy emerged as a viable alternative to imported fossil fuels since the island already possessed the requisite expertise and infrastructure. The growth of nuclear power facilitated the growth of industry on the island; without it, its difficult to imagine that Taiwan would be the leader of the global semiconductor supply chain today.As Taiwans nuclear power sector grew, its leaders used civilian programs to justify proliferation-sensitive activities, but their cover wasnt entirely convincing. In 1977, after U.S. and International Atomic Energy Association inspectors unearthed further evidence that Taiwan was engaging in illicit research and diverting materials from the Taiwan Research Reactor, Washington decided to intervene. Although it downplayed Taiwans capabilities in public, in private the Carter administration threatened to impose sanctions and cut off military assistance unless Taiwan refocused on exclusively peaceful applications. Taiwans growing dependence on nuclear power enhanced Washingtons leverage because the island relied on the United States for reactor fuel and technical support. Washington and Taipei ultimately reached a secret agreement in which the latter promised, among other things, to curtail sensitive activities, export irradiated fuel, and modify the Taiwan Research Reactor to curb plutonium production, functionally making it harder for scientists to amass enough fissile material to secretly build a bomb.Although Taiwan begrudgingly complied with many of these terms, implementation was slow, and the military in particular was dissatisfied by the governments capitulation to U.S. demands. These frustrations assumed a new urgency in December 1978, when the Carter administration announced that it would terminate the U.S.-Republic of China Mutual Defense Treaty and formally recognize the Peoples Republic of China, continuing the Nixon administrations rapprochement with Beijing. This decision precipitated a renewed Taiwanese focus on nuclear weaponsthis time with the military in the drivers seat.The second act in Taiwans proliferation history was fraught. Although the termination of the mutual defense treaty emboldened domestic actors who favored weaponization, the island still relied on the United States for military and economic support. Nor did Taiwanese decision-makers appear to agree on the ultimate goal of a revived nuclear weapons program. While some hoped to quietly develop a small arsenal, others, including then-President Chiang Ching-kuo, apparently favored only acquiring the ingredients to rapidly assemble a bomb (more like the hedging posture of states such as Japan). All these plans were contingent on avoiding detection by the United States or China until the program was sufficiently advanced. Yet past a certain point, keeping things under wraps would have been difficultand extremely risky. If secrecy failed, Taipei risked angering Beijing and alienating Washington in one fell swoop.As it turns out, Taipeis attempts at obfuscation were already compromised. The deputy director of the Institute of Nuclear Energy Research, Chang Hsien-yi, was a CIA mole who had been surreptitiously passing information to the United States for years because he feared the covert weapons program would trigger an unwanted war with China. In January 1988, Chang sent his wife and children on vacation to Tokyo Disneyland and drove to a CIA safehouse. The family was reunited in Seattle a few days later and placed under witness protection.Armed with new proof of malfeasance, the Reagan administration confronted Taipei. Exposed yet again and facing the prospect of U.S. abandonment and Chinese ire, the government agreed to unequivocally dismantle its nuclear weapons program. This included shutting down the Taiwan Research Reactor, shipping heavy water off the island so the reactor could not be restarted, exporting irradiated fuel, and disabling covert facilities and research programs. By the 1990s, Taiwan had functionally abandoned its nuclear weapons ambitions, but its nuclear history was far from over.The demise of Taiwans nuclear weapons program coincided with a profound shift in its domestic politics. Up to this point, the KMT had presided over Taiwans entire nuclear history, maintaining an often brutal political monopoly over the island. By the mid-1980s, however, pro-democracy groups were gaining traction, as economic growth and dissatisfaction with decades of KMT repression fueled popular demands for reform. In 1987, the government lifted martial law and began preparing for a new era of open elections.At the vanguard of this process was the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). When the DPP broke onto the scene, nuclear energy was vital to Taiwans economy. Globally, however, faith in nuclear power was beginning to wane. Infamous accidents sparked fears about nuclear safety, first at Three Mile Island in 1979, then at Chernobyl in 1986as chance would have it, the very year the DPP was founded. This rise in anti-nuclear sentiment was also fueled by revelations that the Taiwanese government had used Orchid Island, an indigenous homeland, as a nuclear waste facility. The nascent party tapped into global momentum and made opposition to nuclear power one of its organizing principles, a means of courting attention abroad while distinguishing itself from the KMT at home.The timing of these developments, however, led to a conflation of Taiwans nuclear weapons and nuclear energy programs. Even now, many Taiwanese associate anything nuclear with the military dictatorship. The same forces that shaped the islands transition away from authoritarian rule thus shaped attitudes toward nuclear power; in other words, the politicization of nuclear energy was a byproduct of Taiwans democratization.In the short term, growing opposition to nuclear power did not negate its practical role in Taiwans energy makeup. The KMT maintained that nuclear power was the only way to avoid dependence on fossil fuel imports, and in 1999, a KMT-led government broke ground on a long-planned fourth nuclear power plant called Lungmen, which would have included the first Generation III reactors built outside Japan. When the DPP captured the presidency for the first time in 2000, the newly elected cabinet suspended construction. Yet it backtracked just a year later, after various legal and political challenges. Despite the opposition of many activists, work at Lungmen continued over the next decade, although it was plagued by delays, controversies, and cost overruns.In 2011, another accident, this time at Japans Fukushima nuclear power plant, decisively tilted the scales against nuclear power in Taiwan. Like Japan, Taiwan is prone to seismic activity, and the Fukushima accident revived anti-nuclear sentiments on the island and throughout the region. Taipei became the single largest donor to Fukushimas victims, and thousands of Taiwanese took to the streets to challenge their governments continued reliance on nuclear energy. Fearing public unrest, in 2014 the government again halted construction at Lungmen, even though work was nearly complete. Although Taiwans president at the time, KMT leader Ma Ying-jeou, supported the project, he backed down following mass protests, including a hunger strike by Lin Yi-hsiung, a former DPP chairman and hero of Taiwans pro-democracy movement. In 2016, the DPP campaigned on the promise of a nuclear-free homeland, and after a historic victory the party started the process of decommissioning Taiwans reactors as their licenses expired.In other respects, however, the DPPs energy policies have come up short. The decision to phase out nuclear power has left Taiwan more dependent on imported fuel precisely as global energy prices skyrocket and the domestic need for clean and reliable energy becomes more acute.Recognizing the enduring challenge of energy insecurityand the growing imperative to reduce carbon emissionscurrent President Tsai Ing-wen promised that renewables would generate 20 percent of Taiwans electricity by 2025. But Taiwan has repeatedly missed these targets; renewables currently account for only 8 percent. Taipei has doubled down on offshore wind projects, since the islands mountainous terrain precludes large-scale solar development. Although technological advances or regulatory reforms may give the sector a boost, expansion is limited by available space. Turbines located in the Taiwan Strait would also be vulnerable in a crisis, and many investors are wary about supporting projects situated in such a precarious geopolitical location.Renewables might improve Taiwans resilience down the line, but they are unlikely to be sufficient anytime soon. In the meantime, the island will continue to rely heavily on coal (42 percent) and natural gas (nearly 39 percent) for electricity generation, making it one of the dirtiest power users in the region. This presents challenges for Taiwans sizable industrial base. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company alone accounts for more than 6 percent of the islands total energy consumption, and demand is only going up. Industry leaders also worry that failure to meet climate targets will reduce export competitiveness.Meanwhile, a more ambitious and militarily capable China is making it even harder to separate energy security from geopolitics. The Chinese navy regularly rehearses blockade and quarantine scenarios that underscore its ability to disrupt Taiwans energy supply chains. While Taipei is taking steps to deepen its strategic stockpiles, current storage facilities for liquefied natural gas in particular are inadequate and vulnerable to a potential blockade.These dynamics have resurfaced questions about the future of nuclear power in Taiwan. Although anti-nuclear sentiment remains salient, when the DPP held a referendum on its phase-out policy in November 2018, 59 percent of voters rejected it, citing environmental concerns and the perils of energy insecurity. And during the recent elections, Lais opponents endorsed proposals to reconsider the Lungmen project and keep remaining reactors online past 2025.For now, as incoming president, Lai remains committed to decommissioning Taiwans final reactors, although in October he said he wouldnt rule out the use of safe, waste-free nuclear. Some reports also suggest that policymakers are looking into keeping nuclear reactors on standby in case of emergency, but it is not clear what this would entail.If Taiwan does rethink its nuclear phase-out, it wont be alone. South Korea and Japan are reinvesting in their nuclear enterprises in response to climate and security concerns. That said, implementing a reversal would likely be more challenging in Taiwan, especially with the DPP at the helm. Anti-nuclear sentiments are ingrained in the partys political DNA, and policymakers reaction to the 2018 referendum suggests they are hesitant to buck this legacy.Leaders would also have to contend with various practical challenges. Taiwans viable reactors are at the end of their 40-year lifespans. Although life extensions are possible pending revisions to licensing procedures, over time the risks of an aging nuclear infrastructure in a seismically active area will only increase. Restarting work on the more advanced reactors at Lungmen might address these concerns, but policymakers should be realistic about costs and timelines. In 2019, state-owned energy company Taiwan Power concluded that the project would not be commercially viable for six to seven years, and estimates have likely increased due to the erosion of nuclear expertise on the island and the physical degradation of the site. Industry leaders have expressed interest in more advanced nuclear technologies, such as Small Modular Reactors, which some argue are safer than older models. While this may be a promising option in the future, the technology is not quite there yet.Even if policymakers could agree on it, nuclear energy is no silver bullet. Because of domestic opposition, Taipei still hasnt found a permanent solution for storing and disposing of nuclear waste. Nuclear energy also isnt impervious to blockades, since Taiwan must import reactor fuel (although these supplies can sustain continuous energy production for months once on the island). Perhaps more worrying, the situation at Ukraines Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has underscored just how dangerous it can be when conflict breaks out near nuclear infrastructure. None of these problems are easy to solve, and policymakers must consider the vulnerabilities that come with having nuclear energy programs alongside the risks of eliminating them.But given the immediate ramifications of energy insecurityboth for the prospects of deterring Chinese aggression and for the globally significant industries located on the islandthe next Taiwanese government should invite serious and specific conversations about the tradeoffs before dismissing the nuclear option altogether. Although decades of politicization have charged debates, nuclear energy programs are inherently technical endeavors. Reviving them only becomes more difficult when governments allow experience, expertise, and infrastructure to atrophy.Taiwan now finds itself backed into something of a corner by its own colorful history. How the Lai administration responds at this inflection point may determine whether the islands nuclear legacy lives on, or whether it gives up these ghosts once and for all.Andrew W.

safe,An African woman prepares traditional injera bread in her home in Berhale, Ethiopia. Climate alarmists anti-fossil fuel mania would keep those like her in the Third World from ever enjoying the modernity of electricity and thereby keep them cooking and heating their homes by burning wood and dried dung. Reliance on those methods exposes her and millions of others around the world to harmful fumes, leading to serious health issues, such as lung disease, blindness, and premature death. (Photo: Roberto Moiola/Sysaworld/ Moment/Getty Images)We all want a future where humans can thrive in a clean environment. But as the eye-opening documentary Climate the Movie: The Cold Truth reveals, while we hear dire warnings that we must rapidly eliminate fossil fuels to avoid a climate catastrophe, we are manufacturing a humanitarian crisis of our own.That means maintaining an energy mix that can handle natures curveballs. It means maximizing our options, not banning entire categories of energy the world still needs. But as environmentalists seek to ban fossil fuels, they are raising the price of electricity for some and depriving others in emerging economies of that valuable resource.The movie aired on YouTube the same week that the Environmental Protection Agency issued final regulations requiring 70% of new cars sold to be hybrid or battery-powered electric by 2032. But that raises costs and inconveniences households for no gain, because banning fossil fuels in America would not affect global temperatures.Despite headlines about worsening hurricanes, data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows no long-term increase in the frequency or intensity of U.S. hurricanes since records began being kept in the mid-1800s.For the worlds poorest nations, giving up fossil fuels is catastrophic. Affordable, dependable power is a life-or-death matter when it comes to delivering basic needs, such as health care, sanitation, safe drinking water, and protection from heat waves and cold snaps.Germanys renewable-energy mandates have driven consumer prices to more than triple the levels seen in the United States. This entirely avoidable situation places a heavy burden on German businesses, unnecessarily increasing their operating costs.By all means, lets use renewable technologies as they become reliable and cost-effective, including nuclear energy. Attempting to legislate an accelerated transition is a recipe for disaster when reality collides with wishful thinking.This is a critical year in the history of our country.

safe,Russia unleashed one of its most devastating attacks against Ukraine's electric sector on Friday, an aerial assault it said was retaliation for recent strikes inside Russia and which could signal an escalation of the war just days after President Vladimir Putin cemented his grip on power in a preordained election.Many Ukrainians were plunged into darkness across several cities, at least five people were killed, and damage to the countrys largest hydroelectric plant briefly cut off power to a nuclear plant that has been a safety risk throughout the war.Russia fired off more than 60 exploding drones and 90 missiles in what Ukrainian officials described as the most brutal attack against its energy infrastructure since the full-scale war began in early 2022.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been urging Western allies for weeks to provide it with additional air-defense systems and ammunition, a period in which $60 billion in U.S. aid has been held up by divisions in Congress.Russia's defense ministry called the Friday attacks strikes of retribution. Ukraine has increased shelling of Russia's Belgorod region along its northeast border and has launched drone strikes targeting Russian oil refineries and other energy facilities.Russia has made progress on the battlefield in recent months against exhausted Ukrainian troops struggling with a shortage of manpower and ammunition along the front line that stretches over 1,000 kilometers (621 miles).When Putin invaded in 2022, he called it a special military operation, and his officials have mostly eschewed the word war. But in a change of rhetoric Friday that may herald a new escalation, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told a Russian newspaper that when the collective West became a participant in this on the side of Ukraine, for us it already became a war.In the winter of 2022-23, Russia targeted Ukraines energy infrastructure, causing frequent blackouts across the country. Many in Ukraine and the West expected that Russia might repeat the strategy this winter, but Russia instead focused its strikes on Ukraines defense industries.Kudrytskyi said that Russia "tried to destroy every significant energy object powering the city of Kharkiv, leaving at least 700,000 without electricity. He estimated that several hundred thousand customers in other regions were also left without power.Oleksiy Kuleba, deputy head of Zelenskyy's office, said that 31 people were injured in the strikes, which also left 200,000 people without constant access to electricity in the Odesa region. He said that power supplies for most of 400,000 customers in the Dnipropetrovsk region were restored.The huge Dnipro hydroelectric power plant, Ukraine's largest, halted operation after sustaining at least six missile hits that caused massive damage. Ihor Syrota, the head of Ukrhidroenergo company overseeing the country's hydroelectric plants, said it lost about a third of its generation capacity in a significant loss for the Ukrainian energy system.Syrota said that the extent of damage to the plant remained unclear because its equipment has been buried under concrete and metal debris from the blasts, noting that the repairs will be a long process.The strikes sparked a fire at the Dnipro plant, which supplies electricity to the nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia, the largest in Europe. Power to the nuclear plant was lost for several hours before it was restored, International Atomic Energy Agency head Rafael Grossi said early Friday. The Zaporizhzhia plant has been occupied by Russian troops since early days of the invasion, and fighting around it has raised the risk of a nuclear accident.The dam at the hydroelectric station was not in danger of breaching, the country's hydroelectric authority said. A dam breach could not only disrupt supplies to the nuclear plant but could potentially cause severe flooding like what occurred last year when a major dam at Kakhovka further down the Dnieper River collapsed.
safe,Today is Opening Day for Major League Baseballwell, kind-of. MLB kicked off the regular season in South Korea this morning with the first of two games between the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres.MLB has to be happy with the teams it chose to headline its international showcase, especially in the case of the Dodgers. Los Angeles was the star of the offseason, as the franchise gave superstar Shohei Ohtani the largest contract in American team sports history and has seen a spike in demand for tickets on the secondhand market.Fans of MLBs 28 other teams will have to wait a little longer for their baseball fix. While the Seoul Series counts as two regular season games for Los Angeles and San Diego, the rest of the league wont experience Opening Day until March 28.Some lying down, others standing, among garbage and wire with razor blades, migrants try to persuade the agents of the Texas National Guard to open the fence, which is guarded, installed days ago with the intention of complicating the crossing of migrants who reach this border in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico on March 19, 2024.

Lucas said in a statement that creating magic is not for amateurs, adding that he was relieved when Iger returned to the company because no one knows Disney better.Opill, the first over-the-counter birth control pill approved for sale in the U.S., was sold for the first time Tuesday.

Opills manufacturer Perrigo suggests retailers sell it in packs of $19.99 for one month, $49.99 for three months, and $89.99 for six months.TOPLINE For five years, founders Srinivas Njay and Bruce Kim have been building interface.ai and its artificial intelligence powered virtual assistant that helps banking customers complete tasks such as filling out a mortgage application and opening a new credit card. So far, theyve signed up more than 100 credit unions and small community banks serving 16 million consumers.With AI in his company name and product, CEO Njay has been fielding a stream of calls from venture capitalists. Hes happy to talk, he says, because at some point, the right investor might help scale up growth. Im just dating, Njay says. We are in a good place, it's not like we need money.Thats because Njay, 37, and CIO Kim, 59, have been able to get their company to this point with just $1 million of their own savings, a $3 million credit line from TMCC, an Indian credit union run by Njays fatherand cruciallyby bootstrapping growth using internally generated revenue.Its not just fintech, either. Other industriessuch as direct-to-consumer ecommercehave already gone through the process of discovering that the winners arent always those with investors throwing money at them before they even have any sales.People are finally converting to the religion of profitability, crows Mike Salguro, who launched meat delivery service ButcherBox in 2015 with $10,000 of savings and a kickstarter campaign offering pre-sales of his premium cuts. While food box services with big VC dollars behind them have struggled, ButcherBox has been profitable since its first year.And Simple Modern, which sells sleekly designed water bottles and other utilitarian products, has become a major success via bootstrappingit made $40 million in profit on $200 million in 2023 sales. Its not just that CEO Mike Beckham doesnt need money from VCs. Its a matter of autonomy, he says.Says Beckham: We stayed bootstrapped because we really felt like we weren't going to be able to run the type of company that we wanted to run if we took outside capital, that the demands of the shareholders or their interests might conflict with some of the things that we wanted to do, especially when it came to giving money away [via donations].WHY IT MATTERS U.S. venture firms raised just $67 billion in 2023, the lowest haul since 2017 and down 61% from 2022. Yes, the VCs are still chasing deals in AI and have plenty of uncommitted funds. But the continued weakness in the market for initial public offerings since 2021s record (and poor-performing) crop, is dragging down private market valuations and limiting what VCs consider worth funding.Despite all the hype, public trust in AI and the companies developing it is decliningglobally, trust in AI companies has dropped to 53% from 61% five years ago, according to data from Edelman. Of course, the simplest way to look at this challenge is that in order for people to trust AI, it has to be trustworthy. Transparent AI means building tools, processes and algorithms that are understandable to non-experts.A next-generation nuclear power plant from Bill Gates-founded TerraPower is set to begin construction in June, marking the start of a larger initiative from the company that aims to bring more affordable and efficient reactors to a competitive nuclear energy market.

safe,The House bill [H.R. 6544] would also extend the Price-Anderson federal accident insurance subsidy, first enacted in 1957 and renewedseven timessince then. The program expires at the end of 2025. It isnt clear why this federal subsidy for nuclear in still needed when the industry insists its new, advanced reactor designs are inherently walk-away safe.The U.S. nuclear industry in recent days has hit three cherries on the federal money-and-policy slot machine. The open question is whether the largess (some might call itpork) will have the intended results: revitalizing a moribund industry by hitching its wagon to the feverish fear of climate change and long-run animosity toward nuclear rivals China and Russia.First, the moneythe most tangible of the goodies Congress and the White House have doled out. On March 5, the ranking members of the House and Senate appropriations committees rolled out a consensus on six money balls, including theEnergy and Water Development and Related Agencies billfunding all government nuclear programs for fiscal year 2024. Passage is almost certainly a done deal.On February 28, the House by an overwhelming 365-36 bipartisan margin passedH.R. 6544, designed to streamline safety reviews by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and give the Department of Energy some authority to buy electricity through purchase power agreements from commercial nuclear power purveyors.In some respects, the legislation is a return to the approach of the now-defunct Atomic Energy Commission in the early days of atomic energy. In 1974,Congress abolished the AEC, and the all-power congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, in large part because the AEC viewed reactor safety as a poor cousin to promotion the atom.to ensure that, while upholding the policies of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA), the licensing and regulation of nuclear activities are carried out efficiently without unduly restricting the potential of nuclear energy and to improve the general welfare and the benefits of nuclear technology to society.Some observers have suggested this hortatory language is unlikely to survive in the Senate. Senators are trying to combine House provisions with a separate bipartisan bill that passed last year as part of the National Defense Authorization Act but was later axed.The legislation would also create a cadre of up to 210 Supergrade nuclear ninjas, possibly paid more than NRC commissioners in some cases. According to the bill language, under some circumstances, the NRC chairman Chairman may, during any period when such a certification is in effect, fix the compensation for such employees or other personnel serving in a covered position without regard to any provision of title 5, United States Code, governing General Schedule classification and pay rates. These alleged experts appear to have the power to second-guess the Senate-confirmed commissioners.The House bill would also extend the Price-Anderson federal accident insurance subsidy, first enacted in 1957 and renewedseven times since then. The program expires at the end of 2025. It isnt clear why this federal subsidy for nuclear in still needed when the industry insists its new, advanced reactor designs are inherently walk-away safe. Congress apparently believes it can assess the risks of nuclear energy more accurately than private sector actuaries.On March 4, the NRC rejected a staff-written draft rule developed over three years for how to regulate the potential new license applications for a variety of advanced reactors. The commission told the staff to rewrite its proposal for a new Part 53 section of the agencys authority embodied in 10 Code of Federal Regulations, joining the current sections 50 and 52, which pertain to large light-water reactors.According to Utility Dive, a key change ordered by the commission rejected a strict checklist of requirements for probabilistic risk assessments while favoring a more flexible framework suited to simplified reactor designs with passive safety features that utilize natural forces, such as gravity or pressure differentials, rather than operator action.In a news release, NRC Chairman Christopher Hanson said, This proposed rule leverages significantly more risk insights than our existing regulatory framework in making safety determinations. Applicants can use our existing regulations today, but this proposed rule will provide future nuclear developers a clear, additional pathway for licensing. The NRC said it expects to publish the new rule in the Federal Register in about six months.This latest effort to revive the largely stagnant U.S. nuclear program is the third time in the last nearly 20 years that the government has tried to pump new life into atomic power. The U.S. program started grinding to a halt in the mid-1970s and was barely treading water by the 1990s. The pipeline of new reactor licenses emptied in 1974, and as the final builders of plants under construction either completed or abandoned their projects, the workforce and supply chain infrastructure hollowed out.In 2005, Congress passed a new Energy Policies Act, which offered a smorgasbord of financial goodies for new plants including loans (they called them loan guarantees to make them look more palatable to opponents of direct federal subsidies, but the Treasury wrote the checks and received the loan payments), cost overrun protections, and extension of Price-Anderson to 2025.The 2005 act was largely a failure. The two preeminent U.S. nuclear power developers, Westinghouse and General Electric, ended up sorely financially injured and in Japanese hands. Former NRC CommissionerPeter Bradford commented, They placed a big bet on this hallucination of a nuclear renaissance.Then came the first push for small modular reactors, designed to downsize the financial risks and construction costs of nuclear power plants. The strategy was the reverse of the economies of scale that drove the first generation of nuclear power plants, where bigger was always assumed to be better, but wasnt.In 2009, reactor vendor Babcock & Wilcox, which had substantial experience building nuclear power plants for U.S. submarines, announced it would offer a 125-MW pressurized water reactor (later scaled up to 180 MW) and a year later unveiled an alliance with builder Bechtel Corp. They called the project mPower.In 2012, the Obama administration announced a $500 million program for development of small modular reactors. In 2013, mPower won financial assistance from DOE, with an award up to around $126 million. The same year, B&W tried and failed to sell a majority share of mPower, then cut back funding by 75%. Bechtel soon soured on the project, and it officially ran out of steam in 2017 after failure to find a customer.Will the latest government attempt to revive nuclear, driven by global warming concerns, succeed? Its not a given. Theres lots to like about smaller nukes. They produce no CO2, have a relatively small footprint, can be sited fairly close to load.But the economics arent clear, as theNuScale sagademonstrates. Some of the non-LWR advanced reactor designs will present licensing challenges, as there is little history behind them. Sodium cooled fast reactors may be particularly problematic, given the well-known problems of sodium as a coolant and the experience with Superphenix in France and Monju in Japan, plus issues of nuclear weapons proliferation.During my tenure as CEO of a uranium exploration company (Calypso Uranium) I was an officially designated representative of Argentina at the 2005 IAEA Semi-Annual Redbook International Symposium, in Vienna, Austria (IAEA Headquarters).  The proceedings were published as: Uranium production and raw materials for the nuclear fuel cycle-Supply and demand, economics, the environment and energy security (my name is on p.333).  This gave me an opportunity to question leading experts in all phases of the nuclear issue, and the bottle-neck soon became clear.  The Critical Path, for construction and commissioning a nuclear power reactor, was not predictable, due to constant environmentalist lawsuits and the dramatic changes in politics associated with election cycle results.  The result, failure to assemble a realistic economic analysis, was a Fatal Flaw.  All of the above report, encouraging as it is, needs to address the lawfare assault on Nuclear Energy, or the advances will be only in totalitarian regimes.As a consumer, this is not a political or environmental issue for me. It is all about what is the biggest dollar win in the cheapest energy input.  Since I live in PA where there is enormous NG reserves, I am going to be dubious about Nuke guys blaming environmentalists for their inability to tell me they have a better deal for me.  Frack on!Theres lots to like about big and small nukes but the fact that they produce no CO2 isnt an example  its irrelevant. In fact, if anything, its a drawback of nuclear energy  increased CO2 has already increased plant growth all over the world.Any facility that pumps liquids, involves rotating machinery and produces or uses electricity must be maintained. Parts that wear out are replaced, newer versions are installed. A nuclear generator could easily be operational for many decades with programmed maintenance, as they are today. Licensing them for a specific time period flies in the face of reality. Homeowners dont walk away from a house with a worn out washing machine, plumbing problems or a leaky roof, they fix them.When innovators interfere by discovering cost-effective approaches, first you find some troubling concern with their technology, and if that fails, discover that the risk was worse than we thought and adjust the regulatory limits down to half of what the new technology can achieve.STILL repeating the same old -same old from the 1940s  mankind does _not_learn very fast. We really need some new thinkers on the scene, but I ask you, who or how or WHERE will the mold (mould for Brits) be broken? Universities teach the same staid approach that has us in the present quagmire thinking/implementations that have not progressed since the 1940s . we are truly STUCK since big science will ONLY fund what big sci has FUNDED before. NO new thinking/presentation of theory (esp at a low level concerning even the electron and its relationship to the nucleus) is allowed.You couldnt be more wrong. Big science is an arm of government, the impetus for carbon sequestration, hydrogen combustion, solar power and wind farms, all experiments that are subsidized by taxes or enpixelated funds.Enpixelated funds are monetary units created by keystrokes without going through mining and minting or even printing. They are abstractions and do not exist in the observable world yet are accepted as payment for debts. Many businesses do not accept real money, only enpixelated funds, despite the phrase on fiat paper federal reserve notes, this note is legal tender for all debts, public and private, Of course these businesses should be shunned by all but internet commerce requires enpixelated funds and their convenience ensnares the modern who regards the pre-digital era as a hopeless social and economic antique of the past.Fiat currency is what I would call an unreliable store of value. It is real money because it is fungible and accepted as legal tender in most scenarios. Its unreliable because it is easily and persistently debased.Its a real word if someone uses it and others understand it. Most people would probably figure it out if they thought about it a little. Gold or silver has a value anywhere and always has. US Confederate notes, Wiemar German bills and Zimbabwean notes are valueless except as curiosities. Gold coins were used by the Romans to pay their troops because they were accepted everywhere and those troops were stationed all over the Empire. Before and after the American revolution almost any gold or silver coins were accepted in trade as well as coins from the UK.Im just saying that all forms of money depend on supply and demand setting the price of the money.  Gold is useful as money because it is rare, it doesnt corrode, and the quantity mined annually is small compared to the total amount already in circulation. It is very difficult to create new supplies of gold. Therefore it can be a relatively stable store of value.The true value of money is tied to the goods and services produced in an economy. While you may consider gold a good when used to make jewelry, in the form of bullion it has no useful function other than to be a stable store of value. People agree to accept it in exchange for goods and services because they know that nobody can create new gold to debase its value and they know that everybody else accepts it as payment.The value we talk about is really how many goods and services can be obtained with the exchange of a certain weight of gold. If two starving people were in a village where one had a piece of bread and the other had a bar of gold, both people would want the bread, and the gold would be worthless.The real price of money is how many useful goods and services you need to supply to receive a unit of currency, how many loaves of bread or hours of labor do you need to get a gold coin?  If there is too much money chasing the same goods and services, there will be price inflation. The same unit of currency buys less.if there was a massive meteorite of pure gold that increased the worlds gold supply by 20%, that would depress the price of gold, the same as if a government suddenly added 20% to the supply of fiat currency. Of course thats highly unlikely to happen.Funding research is paying for effort irrespective of results. Effort that private companies wont fund because the probability of technical or commercial success or the cost-benefit analysis makes no sense.Researchers are people. Why struggle with a difficult problem for 70-80 hrs/week when you get no more pay than if you plod along or even slack off?  If they are getting paid a secure salary regardless of whether they succeed or fail, some of them spend their 40 hours browsing porn, or commenting on X.Im not saying that it is never in the national interest to invest in basic research. What I am saying is that when the research aims toward a practical application, there must be powerful incentives to achieve the goal.If you want a bunch of functioning frantabulators, its probably far more effective for the government to promise to buy the first working prototype for whatever had been contemplated as the cost of research grants, and to buy the first x frantabulators delivered by any maker on a decreasing pricing scale. That is how you incentivize timely results and remove commercial risk.Subsidies are not what is needed. End all the frivolous lawsuits is what is needed. As soon as they file one arrest ALL involved for insurrection, lock their asses in rundown DC jail and then wait 3 years to give them trials.Grandpas and grandmas taking selfies, and FBI + AntiFa agitators,  and no guns , hardly constitutes an attempt to overthrow the government.   Why did Speaker Pelosi refuse additional manpower for security?And tell me, why was the J6 riot allowed to happen? The Capital Police knew there was going to be trouble, so did the FBI. Trump asked for 20,000 National Guardsmen to assist with crowd and riot control. Why was that not granted?Nobody said Trump signed an order.  He offered the troops to Pelosi, and she turned them down.  If Trump was half the dictator the socialists claim he is, he would have just overrode Pelosi and sent the troops anyway.I am of two minds on this. Ignoring troll-bots like Lusername might allow its mind-numbed nonsense to go unchallenged. On the other hand, its probably best if instead of acknowledging its nonsense we  just down-vote and in a separate comment make the case for the realist point of view just once, refusing to engage in a back-and-forth with a robot.I worked on the cancelled Summer 2/3 project in South Carolina. It wasnt frivolous lawsuits that killed the project. It was Westinghouse incompetence that made a predictable construction schedule impossible and caused costs to spiral out of control. The sister project in Georgia was able to survive because they were a bigger company and took the federal loan guarantees.In that case, what was supposed to be a $10 billion project ended up around $30 billion.Until a reactor vendor comes up with a design and builds the prototype on a predictable schedule at a competitive cost and shows that it can be operated reliably and economically, no one in their right mind will risk their money on it.Until a reactor vendor comes up with a design and builds the prototype on a predictable schedule at a competitive cost and shows that it can be operated reliably and economically, no one in their right mind will risk their money on it.  Yes, and with the endless stream of frivolous lawsuits against nuclear industry when will that happen? Hell, DoE, DoJ and BLM/DoI are participating in the dog pile of frivolous crap.Who on Earth came up with the idea, let alone signed it off?  In short, it is the pride flag applied to the Cross of St. George and it isnt inclusive, its an insult. If a nations flag doesnt include someone, then, that someone has a problem all their own.No strat, youre wrong. Since 1707 the national flag of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland has been the Union jack or flag. The cross of St. George, the Welsh dragon flag and the cross of St. Andrew (or saltire) are not national flags but can be (and have been) used as unofficial flags of national identity and thats fine. But what it is not is the national flag of England, ok?I suppose that the antiquated thinking would refer to identifying as British. I must confess that I dont understand the nuance there. I am a Connecticutian, a New Englander, a US citizen, an American, and a Terran. Being from Connecticut doesnt override my American-ness.So thats why Microsoft is hiring nuclear engineers, eh chumly. Your sad tears will be mocked when your woke corporate masters start building a lot of nuke plants. Even if they are woke like you they are not stupid and realize unreliables cant run their cash cow cloud business data centers. Even a caveman can see it.Entering a market with new SMR technology where wind and solar has a huge political constituency built on receiving tax credits and other incentives worth $100s of billions presents a challenge for the inevitable nuclear renaissance. The only question is how long we want to keep pretending that sunshine and breezes can power a modern society.Seems to be many new nuclear job postings by G&Ts with nuclear in their portfolios.  Graybeards in the industry will likely have the opportunity to make lots of money.  Hopefully there are enough around to pass on their knowledge and expertise to the next generation.Using the Levelized Full System Costs of Electricity (LFSCOE) comparison method, wind plus infrastructure plus battery storage are over twice the cost of an equivalent nuclear power plant. Solar plus battery storage is over 3 times more expensive.Yet our politicians pursue a strategy of HOPE that some magical fairy dust will drop battery and transmission line costs down to virtually nothing or hydrogen electrolysis, a technology known for over 230 years but still 10 times more expensive that natural gas on a heat equivalent basis, will make their current generation preferences cost effective.Captain, As you state, our politicians pursue a strategy of HOPE that some magical fairy dust will drop battery and transmission line costs down to virtually nothing. Actually, if the batteries were free grid scale battery storage for more than four (4) hours would still be too expensive; as I suspect you fully understand. The associated packet cost for enclosure, overcurrent protection, switchgear, fire suppression and more costs $200/KWh of the $500+total packet.There is plenty of Hydrocarbon fuel in the world to wait for the new energy tech that will truly demand destruct the Hydrocarbon markets. Classic nuke power is very expensive old tech. Do your homework on the capital costs and subsidy costs of nuke power.I can see nuke power application in areas where there isnt a ample supply of natural gas pipelines but wholesale tax subsidized transition to nuke power is unnecessary and capital costs make it more expensive than multi-tiered NG powered generation.If it aint broken dont fix it.  In the long run, the nuke power noise will be quenched by the rad environmentalists and the Big energy arm into Washington.  There will be no major transition to nuke power.If the GOP wants to do good, make the hydrocarbon fuel markets free of collusion and ensure that emerging tech like ambient SC, fusion do not get suppressed. Stop our politicians from being leveraged to make people pay through the nose for hydrocarbon fuel and stop with this nuke non-sense.In 50 years or less the hydrocarbon market question will be moot due to emerging tech that will demand destroy the market. Isnt this the crux of the issue now anyway.. By then it will be something else like under population and transition to anti-human economy.The current political goal is not to end the hydrocarbon fuel markets. it is to leverage them and maintain the cash cow while wielding the propaganda weapon to instigate a dystopic anti-human world view that will lead significant depopulation in the 50 year interimthat is to ensure that we continue to consume and pay through the nose as we age out and disappear.Thats the funny thing about Emergent Technologies that are at least 50 years down the road, they havent emerged yet and cant be predicted. This is the same trap that the idiots pushing Wind and Solar as well as Lithium batteries have fallen into  lets go with this, a miracle will occur, then itll all be rosy. No miracle has occurred in the last 50 years so what makes you think itll happen in the next 50?Agree, cost benefit analysis has become an big moving target in the past 4-5 years on the internet. My reading indicates the the capital costs 14 times greater than NG fired plants  putting the cost benefit win on the multi-tier NG electrical generation not nuke. This is especially true we there is a good supply distribution of NG which is a good chunk of the USA..  So it makes no sense to replace existing NG plants with nuke plants.What we need is CNG cars not EVs. EVs with the tax subsidy are crazy expensive. think about the impact of all that taxpayer money going down the drain for Lithium batteries that are useless in 10 years or less.  The people who are pushing for nuke and EVs are an economic wrecking crew.Taxpayer subsidized items like humungous sports stadiums are tech as old as Imperial Rome but still go up on a regular basis in Yankeeland and other wealthy neighborhoods. These expensive monstrosities are actually just big television studios but television itself is old tech, depending on your technological time line. The Nautilus was launched in 1954 but were unaware of improvements to its nuclear propulsion system in the 70 years since, if any, because of paranoid secrecy.Which leads to the issue of nuclear generation construction cost, a significant part of which is hardening the facility against an attack. Nuclear plants are engineered to make them as impervious to a suicidal aircraft or bomb as possible, since the success of the US is deemed to make every significant technological technique it embraces a target of barbarian hordes whose jealousy inspires destruction.Tax subsidies for nuke power are pointless and backwards. Nuke is zero gain over fossil fuel. In the same way renewables are a negative gain compared to multi- tiered natural gas electrical generation.  This is true for a simple reason; natural gas if the cheaper option.  This is true even in the era of global hydrocarbon glut and massive global hydrocarbon fuel collusion artificially propping up fuel prices leveraging war and the climate change hysteria.  I think many people on WUWT think the political movement of climate change and global press of hydrocarbon fuel prices would be solved by nuke it wont be.  It is a political problem not a tech problem.  The rad environmentalists who are covertly funding much of the climate change propaganda have a bigger agenda than the world existing hydrocarbon fuel.  They want greater centralization of power and they will leverage everything to achieve it including partnering sideways with the darlings of Davos Big Oil to achieve it.  Frack On!  These are the same people who have built their massive careers generating consumer tech that we paid and invested in with our IRA and 401Ks..which enabled the massive centralization of information, discourse and markets.The question of tech that has been emerging since 1966  (Ambient SC, cold fusion Solar, SC electrical generation, AI Quantum computing, SC motors, fuel Cells, AI, Internet, Flat Screen TVs. Cell phones, person computers etc.). All this emerging tech was conceptualized in the 1960s and early 70s.anyone hanging out at Cal Tech and MIT would have heard the dreamers working up prototypes and conceptualizing a new world with new tech. And if you were hanging out at some of the top law schools you would have heard about the coming threat to human privacy and other threats to democracy empowered by coming socially integrated computer systems. The fear what that these new systems would threaten representative power via greater and greater centralization of discourse, information, distribution of good and services and markets.I lived in the vortex of these developments in D.C. in those days. My Father being a top systems analyst and cold warrior and my friends at MIT and Georgetown, UVA, and  Georgia, law and John Hopkins computer labs and me working as a research assistant.What caught the imagination of investors was consumer tech because of its power and potential to penetrate personally into the lives of everyone globally creating enormous efficiencies and wealth. A massive revolution of consumers paying for consumable (non-capital) tech creating the capital for global centralization of information, discourse and markets  Remember, we bought the products and provide the data which provided the capital for the systems we have today.double cash for the Tech world.What didnt capture the imagination of investors or government subsidies is emerging energy infrastructure tech .. .except solar, which is useless without viable affordable ambient SCMCS. Additionally, fusion is also being dependent on viable affordable ambient SC.So the lynch pin for truly innovative energy infrastructure tech for highly efficient electrical generation and distribution and eventually fusion got lost in the shuffle or suppressed. This is the lynch pin that would have significantly demand destructed the hydrocarbon fuel markets and weakened the global currency of oil as a weapon of powerEven this past summer we saw the science media completely destroy a purported ambient superconductor LK-99 in 2-3 weeks. How is this science? Since then, there have been glimmers of hope for LK-99 that you have to search high and low for or manipulate a AI chat system to reveal. LOL which is fun BTW.Is this the environment that a new Ambient SC will emerge. heck no.  It doesnt matter if LK-99 was a total goof. The message is clear to anyone doing this researchwatch your step or you will be crushed. Compare this to the endless bogus climate propagandized science the science media puts out the same journals that crushed LK-99 in 3 weeks. Read between the lines and you get my point.ToldYouSo, hasnt anyone told you that yes, nuclear requires materials of construction, but it is less mineral intensive by orders of magnitude at >90% capacity factor and 60-year life cycle vs solar at a<30% CF and 30-year lifecycle? What about battery storage forever being too expensive for more than four (4) hours? No one ever told you about that either?High-level nuclear waste consists largely of spent fuel from nuclear reactors. Though it makes up a small proportion of overall waste volumes, it accounts for the majority of radioactivity. This most potent form of nuclear waste, according to some, needs to be safely stored for up to a million years. Yes, 1 million years  in other words, a far longer stretch of time than the period since Neanderthals cropped up. This is an estimate of the length of time needed to ensure radioactive decay.And nobody has yet given a satisfactory answer to the question of what to do with thousands of metric tonnes of high-level nuclear waste, some of which can remain radioactive, and thereby lethal, for up to 300,000 years. Nowhere in the world has anyone managed to create a place where we can bury extremely nasty nuclear waste forever, says Denis Florin, partner at Lavoisier Conseil, an energy-focused management consultancy in Paris. We cannot go on using nuclear without being adult about the waste, without accepting we need to find a permanent solution.As discussed in the referenced article, France, like all other countries with commercial scale nuclear power plants, is just kicking the can down the road when it comes with how to handle and eventually store/dispose of high level nuclear waste from such reactors.In a process pioneered by France, many of the uranium, plutonium and fission chemicals have been reprocessed into new fuel at the La Hague site, while waste chemicals that cannot be reused have been vitrified, or turned into glass, for short-term storage in shallow sites underground.Well no it doesnt does it? The spent fuel rods are no longer waste after reprocessing so the amount of waste to be dealt with is vastly reduced, not increased. There will always be something that needs to be disposed of with nuclear fission but reprocessing is a way of reducing that waste by a considerable amount as well as reducing the amount of raw fuel that needs to be mined. More efficient.Uhhhh . . . I believe the statement in the Financial Times article I linked about the process itself creates yet more radioactive waste refers to the fact that, in the reprocessing of spent fuel rods, a portion of the reprocessing facility itself (e.g., plumbing, containment vessels, rod handling equipment, storage drums, etc.) becomes radioactive, known as induced radioactivity.  Also, the more radioactive waste certainly includes the chemical waste stream of fluids used in in cutting operations to open the sealed fuel rods and in chemically separating the various isotopes contained therein.Radioisotopes with short half-lives are dangerous for the straightforward reason that they can dose you very heavily (and fatally) in a short time. Such isotopes have been the main causes of radiation poisoning and death after above-ground explosions of nuclear weapons . . .Long-term isotopes are more complicated. They dont dose as heavily, but there are a lot more issues than just that. Plutonium for example is comparatively long-lived, but some of its decay products can be quite nasty . . .The biggest danger from radioisotopes with mid-to-long half lives is that they can keep an entire region of earth nastily radioactive for a very long time, e.g. hundreds or thousands or even tens of thousand of years. Thats the main reason why disposing of reactor wastes, which often contain just such isotopes, is such a contentious issue.Those nukes have cooling towers which emit huge plumes of dihydrogen monoxide. Dihydrogen monoxide is the most powerful greenhouse gas. And it kills 4000 people every year in the U.S. and thousands more worldwide. So maybe we should ban it?The base line of liability for any incorporated business is the capital of the corporation. Once the capital is exhausted, claims cannot be paid. So, if claims exceeded the capital of the utility, it could file a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding in Federal court and the claimants would be paid a prorata portion of their claims. Ex-hypotheis, the utilitys assets were destroyed in the incident and its capital would therefor be severely impaired.PAA addressed this problem by imposing on nuclear plant operators an obligation to purchase liability insurance. It allowed the creation of an entity, n/k/a American Nuclear Insurers, which is a pool of large domestic property-casualty insurance and reinsurance companies, to sell the coverage. The required insurance is now $450 million.But, wait there is more. If the damages exceed $450 million, every licensed nuclear plant operator is required to contribute to a fund to pay those claims up to $131 million. The total amount of these contributions is currently about $12.9 billion. There is an additional required surcharge if those funds are depleted of up to 5% of the original contribution. The act provides for federal court jurisdiction to prioritize payments.Does the act protect the utility companies? Not really. They are protected by their corporate charters. No, it protects the rate payers from being forced to pay extra to replenish the utilitys capital so that it can stay in business. It also creates an industry funded mechanism for paying claims promptly and fulsomely.So, where is the subsidy? There isnt any. The Act makes the industry pay for insurance.The Federal Government is not required to pay anything. https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/nuclear-insurance.htmlNumber two, list the energy sources that are affordable, constant and accessible. Do wind and solar meet any of those requirements? No. Do fossil fuels meet those requirements? Yes. Does nuclear meet those requirements? Yes.It has been a long time since I did the reading but if I recall properly, the Price-Anderson Act has never cost US taxpayers a single penny. It is a Federal Government guarantee demanded by the insurance and finance sectors to limit their costs in case of a major nuclear plant disaster which has never happened. Calling it a subsidy is a convoluted though process although I suppose, if the extremely unlikely ever did happen, it might involve some taxpayer costs, depending on which way the politicians jumped.Nuclear waste storage is a red herring in any rational world. Again, based of earlier reading, the type of reactor normally built in the US, perhaps all of US reactors, use less than 1% of the energy in the fuel rods. According to theory, there are design that can use about 99%, producing very little waste.The leftover stuff could be very valuable in itself for other uses with some processing but I dont know if the processing costs for most of that would be economicalThere are physical difficulties with the design of such reactors, such as materials that can stand up to corrosion well enough to make the designs viable, but the potential is there if there could be enough interest to do the necessary material research (perfect first, build reactors after).Also, some other countries are not hobbled with the same stupidity as US regulations. They reprocess the used fuel, considerably reducing the waste to begin with. As above, this waste can be valuable in itself as a source of radioactive materials that have uses in industry and medicine, as well as for atomic batteries in locations needing moderate power for long periods without human intervention or maintenance.
safe,On Tuesday, the chambers Environment Committee decided to conduct a fact-finding study on the role of nuclear energy in guiding Italy through the energy transition, to achieve decarbonisation by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050. [Shutterstock/Roberto Giachino]The Italian Chamber of Deputies will launch a major inquiry into how nuclear energy could help Italy reach its energy transition goals, a significant step as the country remains the only G7 nation not operating nuclear power stations, having shut down the last plant over 30 years ago.On Tuesday, the chambers Environment Committee decided to conduct a fact-finding study on the role of nuclear energy in guiding Italy through the energy transition, to achieve decarbonisation by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050.A previous attempt to bring back nuclear power from the former pro-nuclear government of late Silvio Berlusconi, who took office in 2008 and proposed that nuclear power comprise 25% of Italys energy mix by 2030, was shot down by a referendum in 2011.If there is a climate emergency, we must have advanced third-generation reactors immediately and not wait for the fourth or fifth, or even nuclear fusion, which is still a dream at the moment, he said, adding that an urgent decarbonisation initiative should commence without delay.Tabarelli, who was recently appointed special envoy to the troubled ex-Ilva steelworks in Taranto, also stressed the importance of nuclear power in Europe, saying that while existing plants such as those in France were ageing, the continent needed nuclear energy to complement the currently less consistent production of renewables.Speaking to Euractiv, Katiuscia Eroe, Legambiente energy expert, said: It is clear, data in hand on the role of nuclear power globally, timing, cost, and unresolved problems, that nuclear power can have no role in Italys energy transition.Safe nuclear power does not exist, its pure science fiction. We do not have time, in a country with an average of more than 140 extreme weather events, to think about failing technologies, she added.In addition, last November, Italys National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development (ENEA) signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Ansaldo Nucleare, RATEN, SCK CEN and Westinghouse Electric Company for the joint industry-wide development of the Small Modular Reactor (SMR).
safe,Russia launched a massive wave of deadly overnight attacks on Ukraine using over 90 missiles and 60 Iranian-made drones, Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Friday, in one of the largest offensives recently."Russian missiles do not have delays, as do aid packages to our country. The 'Shahed' have no indecision, like some politicians. It is important to understand the cost of delays and postponed decisions," he said."We need air defence to protect people, infrastructure, homes and dams. Our partners know exactly what is needed. They can definitely support us... Life must be protected from these non-humans from Moscow"."The enemy is now carrying out the largest attack on the Ukrainian energy industry in recent times," Energy Minister German Galushchenko said on Facebook, adding that shelling had knocked out "one of the power transmission lines feeding" the Zaporizhzhia power plant.Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian mayor of the city of Mariupol, under Russian control since 2022, said on Telegram that a Russian missile had hit a trolleybus at the Dnipro hydroelectric station, also in Zaporizhzhia, killing civilians travelling on it.The combined net income of Turkish banks increased by 14 percent in the first two months of 2024 from a year ago to 74.7 billion Turkish Liras, data from the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BDDK) have shown.
safe,Appointed shadow energy spokesperson a few months earlier, Mr O'Brien's enthusiasm for nuclear power was already well known, but not yet fully formed as Coalition policy. By many in Canberra, it had been regarded with idle curiosity."I've heard many stories about the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, including some unfounded horror stories and wildly untrue claims. I therefore decided to travel to Fukushima to find out for myself," he said."Tell him he's dreaming," Mr Bowen said last Sunday when asked about the Coalition's plans. His concern was not safety, where there have been significant improvements since Fukushima, but cost and practicality."I don't know what expert he's talking to  The average build time of a nuclear power plant in the United States has been 19 years. Ted O'Brien thinks he can do it in Australia from 10 [years] with a standing start," he said.The CSIRO and the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) tell us that even with the cost of transmission and storage, renewables are still the cheapest form of power, with the temporary exception of gas, which the government says will play a role in the transition.And while noteworthy historic disasters have given nuclear power something of a PR problem, the government's nuclear expert agency says the latest technology is much safer than Chernobyl or Fukushima might suggest.First, large-scale nuclear power plants are expensive. The cheap power produced by plants in Europe comes only after decades of operation, enough time for the operators to have recouped their significant upfront capital costs.A single large plant of the sort used in Europe, according to CSIRO and AEMO, would account for such a huge chunk of our power needs that it would be inadvisable, since the whole grid would falter if the plant went offline for maintenance, or due to some fault.Some have called instead for "small modular reactors" (SMRs)  mini nuclear plants, assembled in a factory, which can be set up quickly. Unlike large plants, they can also be switched on and off quickly, which means they could "pinch hit" to provide power alongside renewables or other power sources.But the change in leadership after the 2022 election saw a surprisingly rapid shift  with new Nationals leader David Littleproud openly calling for nuclear power to be on the table just weeks after polling day.Peter Dutton also flagged early enthusiasm, although at first only in principle. Then, shortly after the Dunkley by-election loss a fortnight ago, he confirmed this would become official Coalition policy.MPs in those areas would have the difficult task of selling a nuclear reactor to their electorate. So far, they seem cautiously enthusiastic, though some wantassurances the technology is safe. Gippsland MP Darren Chester warned community concerns would need to be "ameliorated".There's also the question of where to put the waste. Mr Dutton has sought to "put things in perspective" by pointing out the waste generated in the US since the 1950s "would fit in the area the size of a football field, to a depth of about nine metres".But if selling locals a nuclear plant is challenging, selling them a nuclear dump would be even more so although as Mr Dutton points out, the same challenge awaits on waste from nuclear submarines under the AUKUS agreement.And energy experts say that realistically, any private sector contribution would only come if investors had enough confidence the project would make it through to completion. That would require bipartisan support.Ms Reeve said large-scale plants would not be suitable for this "last resort" role because they take weeks to switch on and off. If Australia built a large-scale plant, it would be as a replacement for renewables rather than the icing on the cake. And it would almost certainly be more expensive.Tennant Reed from the Australian Industry Group said Australia's energy future almost certainly lies in large-scale solar and wind because it is cheap, abundant and opens doors to developing green export industries.
safe,LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will set out plans to boost Britain's nuclear workforce on Monday, as increased submarine building and the growing needs of the nuclear energy industry are forecast to create 40,000 new jobs by 2030.The government will partner with defence companies BAE Systems (LON:BAES), Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) and Babcock plus energy giant EDF (EPA:EDF) to invest more than 763 million pounds ($961 million) by the end of the decade in skills, jobs and education, it said in a statement.The government needs to ensure there are sufficient nuclear workers to help build and maintain its fleet of submarines, vital for defence and security as they are the basis of the UK's continuous at-sea nuclear deterrent."Safeguarding the future of our nuclear deterrent and nuclear energy industry is a critical national endeavour," said Sunak, who will on Monday visit Barrow-in-Furness in the northwest, where Britain's nuclear submarine industry is based.Further details on how Britain will deliver the capabilities necessary for to maintain its nuclear deterrent will be published by defence secretary Grant Shapps on Monday in the "Defence Nuclear Enterprise Command Paper", Sunak's office said.As part of it plans to boost the nuclear workforce, the government said it will invest 200 million pounds in Barrow over the next decade to help support people into jobs, improve the area's transport infrastructure and build more homes.
safe,Rishi Sunak's visit comes amid concerns the UK isn't spending enough on defence - with no new money pledged in the budget. He says new investment will secure Britain's nuclear deterrent and lower energy costs through nuclear power.Foreign Office minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan and security minister Tom Tugendhat also wrote an article this month calling for a "much greater pace" of investment in light of the threat from countries such as Russia.
safe,The Prime Minister will today [Monday 25th] declare a 'national   endeavour' to secure the future of the UK's thriving defence and civil   nuclear industry, as he visits Barrow-in-Furness and announces a   significant package of investment in skills, jobs and communities.Domestic nuclear capability is vital to our national defence and   energy security, underpinning our nuclear deterrent and securing   cheaper, more reliable energy for UK consumers. The nuclear industry is   growing rapidly, requiring 50% more highly skilled workers in the next   ten years - and we need to train a new generation of British talent.The Government is partnering with industry, including BAE Systems,   Rolls-Royce, EDF and Babcock, to invest at least 763 million by 2030 in   skills, jobs and education. The investment will create more than 8,000   career opportunities to help the sector fill 40,000 new jobs by the end   of the decade - and will support plans to double the number of nuclear   apprentices and graduates and quadruple the number of specialist science   and nuclear fission PhDs.As the home of the UK's Astute-class nuclear submarines - the most   advanced attack submarines ever operated by the Royal Navy - and the new   Dreadnought programme and UK AUKUS submarine production, the Cumbrian   town of Barrow-in-Furness is also central to the UK's defence nuclear   ambitions. The Prime Minister will therefore announce today the   creation of a Barrow Transformation Fund, with the Government committing   an immediate 20 million and a further minimum of 20 million a year   over the next 10 years to make Barrow an even more attractive place to   live, work, and build a nuclear career.Building on these new investments, Defence Secretary Grant Shapps   will later today publish the Government's Defence Nuclear Enterprise   Command Paper, setting out for the first time the full breadth of   activity to sustain andmodernise the UK's continuous at-sea nuclear   deterrent - a cornerstone of national and global security for more than   55 years.That's why we are investing in Barrow, the home   of UK submarines, and in the jobs and skills of the future in the   thriving British nuclear industry. Today we usher in the next generation   of our nuclear enterprise, which will keep us safe, keep our energy   secure, and keep our bills down for good.It is expected to set out how the UK will deliver the capabilities   necessary to maintain our independent nuclear deterrent - including   progressing plans to bring new Dreadnought Class submarines into service   in the early 2030s, deepening cooperation with our partners under the   flagship AUKUS agreement and upgrading key infrastructure - supported by   an additional 3 billion in funding for our nuclear enterprise   announced last year.The UK's ambitious defence plans are underpinned by major new   investment in Barrow. To unlock Barrow's huge potential and support a   growing workforce, the Government will commit an initial 20 million   forimmediate projects, including supporting people towards work,   community projects and completing construction on the A595 Grizebeck   Bypass, and a minimum of 20 million a year over 10 years to improve   health outcomes, build more homes, develop the transport network and   support local schools.Barrow is at the heart of the UK's submarine   enterprise and as the custodian of our submarine design and build   capability, we're incredibly proud of the role we play in the Astute,   Dreadnought and now SSN-AUKUS programmes.The long-term vision set out in the command   paper is hugely welcome and will support the necessary infrastructure   development and recruitment required for the delivery of these important   national security programmes.This is a fantastic opportunity for the UK to   deliver a stronger nuclear industry that will contribute to the   resilience of the UK's independent deterrent and will support the UK's   energy security ambitions and net zero targets. As well as providing   bed-rock support for the ambitious development required across industry   and government for the AUKUS programme.Babcock is proud of the leading role it is   taking in driving forward initiatives to retain and grow the critical   mass of nuclear skills we need today and tomorrow. We have a keen focus   on our major nuclear sites in the South West of England and in Scotland   and are determined to leverage the benefits of the NNSPS, with our   customers and other industry partners, across the broader communities we   serve.EDF welcomes the joint commitments announced   today and looks forward to working with Government and industry to help   deliver the great opportunities for people who choose to work in the   nuclear sector.EDF has been at the heart of the UK's nuclear   energy sector for over 15 years and in 2024 is hiring a further 1,000   people into its UK nuclear family - in operations, construction,   engineering support and many other exciting roles. The majority of these   will be apprentices and graduates, as well as those with relevant   skills from other industries.As we have learned in recent years there is an   urgent need to attract, train and inspire the next generation of people   who can design, build, operate and decommission existing and new nuclear   facilities. We are excited to be part of this national endeavour.As a proud member of the Nuclear Skills Council   and an important partner in the Defence Nuclear Enterprise, we welcome   news that the UK is going to go even further in its mission to meet the   growing demand for nuclear expertise. It is an exciting and fascinating   time for the industry as both civil and defence organisations   collaborate to ensure we all have a strong and sustainable pipeline of   talent coming into the world of nuclear.Nuclear has the power to protect and help meet   the growing demand for clean energy, so news of the UK's commitment to   this unique industry is a sign of its importance. From opening our   Nuclear Skills Academy, which welcomes 200 apprentices every year for at   least the next decade, and our recently announced site expansion work,   which is creating over 1,000 new highly-skilled jobs in Derby, to new   satellite offices creating almost 300 jobs in Glasgow and Cardiff,   Rolls-Royce is playing a pivotal role in supporting this national   endeavour."As part of today's visit, the Prime Minister is expected to meet   apprentices working on the Royal Navy's cutting-edge nuclear submarines.   The UK's nuclear industry is going through an unprecedented period of   growth, driven by the Government's ambitious nuclear energy targets, and   is expected to need 123,000 people by 2030.The investment in nuclear skills - which includes 350 million from   the Government and more than 400m from industry - will create some   5,000 new apprenticeships in the next four years. It will also drive   private investment and create job opportunities for everyone from   specialist scientists and engineers, to welders and electricians, to   project managers and Royal Navy submariners.This follows the major reforms and 60 million worth of investment   outlined by the Prime Minister following the Spring Budget to enable   20,000 more apprenticeships and slash unnecessary regulatory burdens.
