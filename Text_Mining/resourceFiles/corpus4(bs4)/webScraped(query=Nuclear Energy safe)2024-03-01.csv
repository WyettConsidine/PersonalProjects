I grew up in Connecticut and studied nuclear-energy engineering technology before joining the Navy in 2011. I worked on a submarine, so I moved around a lot. I was stationed in South Carolina, New York, and Hawaii and visited places like Singapore.Right after my contract with the Navy ended in 2017, I moved to San Francisco to work at Tesla, and then I took a job at my current company, KLA. I took the job knowing it was based in San Francisco, but I kept telling my boss that I would be interested in moving to Singapore if the opportunity arose.I lived in the Tenderloin in San Francisco. Nearly every time I got off the Bay Area Rapid Transit trains in the city at night, I would see people using and selling drugs. My car was also broken into frequently.The food is really good because the surrounding countries  including Malaysia, India, and China  heavily influence Singaporean culture. I love very spicy food, so mala and hotpot are my favorites. I like to order  (big spicy) occasionally, but I limit that to once a month since it takes a toll on my body.Singapore has big street markets with various food stalls that sell what's known as "hawker" food. I eat that at the office most days. For $3.71, I usually get noodles and dumpling soup. When working from home, I like to go to my local hawker  (economic rice) stall and get a portion of pork, chicken, and rice for $2.08.Healthcare isn't free, but it's much cheaper than in the US. I recently jammed my toe so hard, I was convinced it was broken. I went to the emergency room, got X-rays, and saw a doctor, and it cost under $200. I imagine that would've cost thousands of dollars in the US.Singapore is quite diverse, and people live comfortably with each other. I occasionally get stares in certain areas, but overall, people are friendly. Many Europeans and Americans work here, so I don't stand out too much.As an American, living without a car feels like not having freedom, but I think buying a car in Singapore is financially irresponsible unless you have many kids and need to move around. Here, you could order a taxi or private hire car to drive you around daily for about the same price as owning a car.Singapore is one of the most expensive cities in the world, but when I lived in San Francisco, the rent was even more expensive. The salaries in the Bay Area are much higher than in Singapore, but taxes are much lower here, so it balances out.
The world is currently in the process of reevaluating its past rejection of nuclear power and is increasingly starting to view it as a reliable source of power that allows for greater energy security. This is at least in part due to the energy crisis that befell Europe after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, vindicating past worries that over-reliance on fossil fuels from autocratic regimes has made the Western countries vulnerable to political blackmail.It is now clear that Western use of natural gas and petroleum from aggressive dictatorshipswhich use cash flows from oil and gas sales to reinforce and expand their hold on powerhas backfired badly. In this context, the experience of Armeniaa small country that draws 40 percent of its energy from nuclear poweris instructive, showing how nuclear power can be instrumental in building societal reliance and political stability.Living in the dark cold. It is the winter of 19921993. As I climb the dark stairs in a freezing-cold Soviet apartment building in Yerevan, the capital of Armenia where my family and I live, the water from the two full buckets I carry is splashing down my legs and freezing on the stairs. My sister Shooshan and I, 14 and 15, are carrying water up to our 11th-floor apartment. The water to our apartment shut off weeks ago, and we get at most one hour of electricity each day. I estimate that we need exactly seven gallons of water, if we are careful, for our basic daily needs. So, we repeat the trip every day. During the precious hour when we do get electricity, my mother rushes to the kitchen to cook food for the next 24 hours. I run to the bakery, where I stand in a long queue to buy the half pound of bread that the state has rationed for each one of us.The daily routine, which goes on for the whole winter, is exhausting. But it is also empowering. As teenagers we feel that we are stronger than the disastrous conditions inflicted on us by the combination of the Soviet collapse, the Nagorno-Karabakh war, and the ensuing severe energy crisis.The reasons that my sister and Iand the thousands of other Armenian teenagers like ushad to lug water and plan their lives around the one hour of electricity during that cruel winter go back to the turbulent events that shook Armenia during the preceding decades.In the 1970s and 1980s, the Soviet Unionwhich Armenia was part ofrapidly expanded its fleet of nuclear reactors to support its growing industrial energy needs. As a result, two pressurized water reactors (PWR) of the Soviet VVER-440 type were built in the Armenian town of Metsamor, about 30 kilometers west of Yerevan. Started in 1977 and 1980, respectively, the two reactors quickly covered more than half of the energy needs of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. (The remainder of the electricity was generated by Armenias hydroelectric stations and gas-fired power plants.) The Armenia of the 1980s was a tiny but prosperous Soviet republic that prided itself in a highly educated labor force, an array of scientific institutes, and a vibrant electronics industry that produced some of the early Soviet computer mainframe designs.Chernobyl. On April 26, 1986, one of the Soviet-designed, graphite-moderated RBMK reactors at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant underwent a catastrophic power excursion that ripped the reactor open. The explosion and fire that followed propelled an enormous amount of radioactive matter into the open atmosphere leading to what is now known as the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, with widespread radioactive contamination, hundreds of deaths from acute radiation poisoning, and likely thousands of additional deaths due to radiation-induced cancers in the months and years that followed.The Chernobyl accident resonated worldwide, dramatically undermining public trust in nuclear power as a safe source of energy. The public perception of danger from nuclear power was magnified by the outrageous lies that the Soviet leadership spread about the disaster, the obvious incompetence and irresponsibility of the Soviet nuclear designers who built and operated the Chernobyl reactor, and the poorly executed cleanup efforts which were compounded by miscalculations and gross mistakes.Overnight, citizens across the Soviet Union and beyond went from a blissful ignorance about radiation to an understandableyet irrationalfear of anything radiation-related. People in Armenia, despite living more than 2,000 kilometers away from Chernobyl, started perceiving radioactive threats everywhere, often attributing many of their common ailments to radiation. Physicists, like my parents, tried to explain what radiation is and how natural doses of radiation are not dangerous. But their advice was sometimes met with hostility: Werent the builders of Chernobyl also scientists?In one chilling conversation that I witnessed at a dinner party, one of the guests told my father only half in jest, You physicists you should all be shot! To paraphrase Valery Legasovs eponymous character from HBOs five-part mini-series Chernobyl: The danger of the lies is not that we mistake them for the truth, but that when enough lies are told we lose hope in the truth and start believing in stories. (Legasov was a Soviet chemist who actively worked on the causes and consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. Concerned by the lack of nuclear safety in the Soviet nuclear industry, he died by suicide on April 27, 1988.)An earthquake, the Soviet collapse, and war. In December 1988, the devastating earthquake of Spitak killed 50,000 peoplea harrowing 2 percent of Armenias populationand destroyed most of the countrys infrastructure. The two VVER-440 reactors at Metsamor were suddenly in the public eye. Would another earthquake rip them open and turn Armenias heartland, where half of Armenias population lived, into a Chernobyl-like radioactive wasteland?To be clear, the PWRs at Metsamor are safer than the shoddily designed, graphite-moderated reactors at Chernobyl. Metsamors Soviet reactor design is close to the standard PWR designs that are still the most common reactor technology used in Western countries. And the buildings and the reactor structures were reinforced to account for Armenias seismic activity. But none of that mattered. After the Soviet governments grotesque lies about the Chernobyl disaster, the official assurances that the Metsamor reactors were safe did not convince many. Legasovs intuition was right: The pursuit for truth was replaced with belief in conspiratorial rumors. An environmentalist movement sprang up, calling for the shutdown of the Metsamor reactors. The authorities backed down, and the two reactors were turned off on February 25 and March 18, 1989.Shortly after the shutdown, the Soviet Union started to crack, finally collapsing in 1991. In neighboring Azerbaijan, an Armenian minority living in the mountainous Nagorno-Karabakh region, feeling marginalized and discriminated against, had long been fighting to protect their civil rights. With the weakening of Soviet power, the protest movement turned into demands for secession from Azerbaijan. The response in Azerbaijan was a series of brutal anti-Armenian pogroms in the cities of Sumgait and Baku that killed hundreds of Armenian civilians and forced about 300,000 others to flee the country. Fearing retaliation, the Azeri civilians living in Armenia fled en masse to Azerbaijan.A relatively peaceful political disagreement had suddenly turned into a violent conflict, with Azerbaijans pogroms against Armenians escalating to a total war against the Armenian people of Nagorno-Karabakh. As the Armenian government supported the Nagorno-Karabakh secessionists, Azerbaijan retaliated by shutting off some of the natural gas pipelines that led to Armenia. In a sense, Azerbaijans authorities did to Armenia what Russian President Vladimir Putin is now doing to Western European countries that support Ukraines war effort. With its nuclear reactors and natural gas supply shut down, Armenia was left with a reduced capacity to generate electricity.Then came the winter of 19921993. Mountain rivers froze, hydroelectric dams dried up, and suddenly hydropower too was nearly gone. Armenia was getting barely a trickle of electricity. What followed is a period now known in Armenia as tsurt u mut tariner, literally the cold and dark years: severe shortages of electricity, freezing concrete apartment complexes, closed schools, and many other disruptions. The economy collapsed, with Armenias gross domestic product contracting by an estimated 50 to 80 percent between 1990 and 1993. Then, a massive exodus followed, shrinking Armenias population by a quarter in just a few years.Nuclear power revival. The Armenian public quickly realized that, by abandoning nuclear power, it had forfeited the countrys energy independence. That vulnerability wasand still isvery effectively leveraged by its arch-enemy Azerbaijan. Was it too late to restore nuclear power?Understanding their mistake, the Armenian authorities re-evaluated their past decision. The choice was stark: Either indulge in exaggerated fears of radiation and face unpredictable consequences, or sober up and accept nuclear power as a lesser evil. Ultimately the government chose the sober option. But rather than rushing headfirst to hastily restart the Metsamor nuclear power plant, the authorities decided to make significant safety improvements to the reactors.One of the Metsamor reactors finally restarted on November 5, 1995, just before the winter season. The desperately needed 400 megawatts flowed again into the small countrys languishing power grid. Almost overnight, lights were turned on, water pumps worked again, and industries revved up to capacity. Children like my sister and I stopped their exhausting routine and Armenia became a net exporter of electricity.Over the 13 years that followed, Armenias economy grew by an unprecedented 700 percent. The difficult decision to restore nuclear power had saved Armenia and had put it on a path of development. In 2020, about 35 percent of electricity generated in Armenia came from nuclear, 25 percent came from renewables (primarily hydropower), and the remaining 40 percent from fossil fuels. (In 2021, the share of nuclear power temporarily dropped to 26 percent because the Metsamor reactor was shut down longer than usual to perform a thermal annealing of the pressure vessel, a maintenance method aimed at managing aging effects.)Despite its important contribution to the electricity mix, the nuclear power plant at Metsamor is not without problems. Mainly, like most Soviet-era PWRs, the reactor does not have the external containment building that is common with Western designs. It is also an aging machine. Because of Armenias growing energy needs, the Metsamor reactor has been issued multiple lifetime extensions. Based on current plans, Metsamors VVER-440 reactor will shut down permanently by 2036. Meanwhile the Armenian government has been busy exploring replacement alternatives, such as possibly US-built small modular reactors (SMRs), seen as a viable replacement. Armenian officials have also entered in discussions with Russia about the possibility of replacing the Soviet-era VVER-440 reactor with the much larger and more modern Russian VVER-1200 design. While the US option is not easymainly because of the lack of readiness of most SMR designsthe Russian option is particularly fraught. Armenia is reluctant to further increase its energy dependence on Russia, given Putins campaign of neo-Soviet expansionism. This is further exacerbated by the technical and economic difficulty of hosting a 1200-megawatt electric VVER-1200 unit on a grid that on average consumes only about 1,000 megawatts.Survival in the shadow of petro-dictatorship. In recent years, social scientists have studied the negative impacts of nuclear power on underprivileged communities, such as the effects of uranium mining on indigenous populations. These studies are important for understanding the social cost of this resource. However very rarely have scholars studied the positive impact that nuclear power has had in helping the victims of oppression.Most of the three million inhabitants in Armenia trace their lineage to the survivors of the Armenian Genocide of 1915. Most live near the border with the perpetrator state of Turkey, which to this day refuses to acknowledge its crime and in the recent past has actively helped Azerbaijan. Since 1993, Azerbaijan has been ruled by the Aliyev dynasty with an iron fist, strengthened by the cash flows from the export of the countrys large hydrocarbon reserves to Western countries. To further strengthen his hold on power, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev (son of Heydar Aliyev who held power in Azerbaijan for several decades) has tapped into Azerbaijanis trauma from the 1990s by demonizing Armenians and blaming all of Azerbaijans ill on this minority.Since he took power in 2003, the regime of Aliyev son has been accused of curtailing free speech and ethnic cleansing of Armenians, whereas Azerbaijans armed forces have been busy mounting a campaign of widespread cultural erasure. These decades of threats culminated in last September with a swift military attack on the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which in just one week brought the 3,000-year-old indigenous Armenian presence there effectively to an end. The situation currently is so severe that Luis Moreno Ocampo, a former chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, has warned that a new genocide may be underway.Armenians, whose newly budding democracy is under constant threat from the various authoritarian governments in the region, cannot achieve cultural and existential security if they do not have a state that ensures their security. And that includes energy security, to which nuclear power generation is key. Of course, Azerbaijan deserves to have a democratic government, too, something that is being hindered by the Western countries over-reliance on fossil fuel exports.The lessons of small nations. When it comes to understanding the value of nuclear energy, studies tend to focus on the big nuclear powers such as the United States, China, and Russia. They rarely study the experiences of small countries like Armenia. Still, the study of these insignificant players is important in terms of understanding the mistakes made, successes achieved, and lessons learned, which can be relevant for the big players as well. In a telling example, Germany is learning the hard way about the dangers of complacency when it comes to choosing between nuclear energy and fossil fuels for its energy mix: Over the last 20 years, German politicians preferred to shut down their scarybut nonetheless safenuclear power plants and increase their potentially destabilizingbut considered harmlessreliance on Russias natural gas. Had German policymakers studied Armenias experience of the 1990s, they could probably have avoided the energy crisis the country is currently experiencing.Sadly, its hard to tell whether European leaders have learned anything from Armenias struggle for energy security. In a now much-criticized statement from 2022, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called Azerbaijans dictator Ilham Aliyev a reliable partner. This gesture is now believed to have, at least partly, emboldened the Aliyev regimes brutality toward the Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh. At least for now, it is as if Europe is merely switching dictators while maintaining the same dependence on fossil fuels.Only a full reckoning by Western countries of their over-reliance on fossil fuels can put an end to the authoritarian regimes that exist only because of their hydrocarbon exports. Such a reckoning, along with the development of renewable energy and nuclear power, would lead to net gains for the climate and the environment. It would also help strengthen liberal democracies that are being unprecedently threatened.The Bulletin elevates expert voices above the noise.

I would love to visit my parents home country some day, and tour our nuclear facilities as a partner and advocate myself.Thank you for the article, indeed those years without electricity had a huge negative impact not only economical but also social and psychological. I would like also to note a historical error in the article  Armenians were living in the Autonomous Oblast of Nagorno-Karabakh, there was no such thing as region.Thank you very much for this personal and national story. Its an important addition to what many people know, and some of us who teach should use it in any related courses (I certainly will). At the same time, your numbers for mortality and cancer incidence from the Chernobyl accident are much larger than those published by the Chernobyl Forum, the most detailed and long-term source of analyses.

Read on to learn how sustainable investing works, some examples of sustainable investing and how to build a socially responsible investment portfolio.In general, sustainable investing can encompass a wide spectrum of investment activities that range from traditional finance to philanthropy, according to Jeff Finkelman, chartered financial analyst and managing director of sustainable investments at Fiduciary Trust International.It includes simple strategies that seek only to avoid certain industries, such as tobacco or firearms, as well as those that strive to generate positive social or environmental change with investments in renewable energy, affordable housing or any number of other challenging markets in need of capital, he said.Sustainable investors often use negative or exclusionary screening to avoid investing in companies that dont meet certain ESG criteria. Using this approach, an investor may refuse to buy a companys securities if it scores poorly compared with its peers on ESG factors.Some investors choose to exclude entire industries from their portfolios. For example, an investor may avoid sin stocks, generally defined as businesses that many people consider unethical, such as tobacco, alcohol, firearms, gambling and adult entertainment. Or you may refuse to invest in oil or nuclear energy stocks due to their environmental impact or in private prisons out of social concerns.Another approach is to use positive screening, also known as a best-in-class approach. Essentially, this is when investors look for companies and sectors that rank better on ESG factors than their peers. For instance, an investor may choose to invest only in companies that rank above at least 50% of their peers based on a number of preselected criteria.While the terms sustainable investing and ESG investing are often used interchangeably, theyre not quite the same thing. ESG investing is one type of sustainable investing, but there are several other strategies that fall under the sustainable investing umbrella.Impact investing is where you aim to achieve measurable environmental or social goals while also earning financial returns. For example, many communities in the US are considered food deserts, which means they have little access to fresh, healthy food. Investing in a grocery store or restaurant that provides healthy food in one of these communities would be a form of impact investing. The goal is to measurably improve the nutrition of residents, but you also aim to earn a profit on your investment.Another approach is to use thematic funds to invest money in a cause that matters to you. You can find mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that invest around an array of themes, such as womens leadership, clean energy and global health care. You could also invest in individual companies that are proactively working to address issues you care about.One of the big misconceptions about sustainable investing is that its less profitable than other investment approaches. The evidence is mixed, though. Some studies suggest that theres no relationship between sustainability factors and a funds performance, while others conclude that sustainable funds perform at least as well as other funds in their peer group.At the individual company level, theres evidence that adherence to sustainable principles is good for profits. Researchers at New York Universitys Stern School of Business found that sustainability initiatives at corporations are associated with more innovation, and that low carbon strategies were linked to positive financial performance.Sustainable investments may also be less risky than companies that dont have a track record of socially responsible practices. For example, a company with a strong commitment to ESG factors are less likely to be at the center of an environmental disaster, a data breach or a fraud case.Sustainable investing matters because it helps you build wealth in a way that doesnt conflict with your conscience. Many people arent comfortable investing in companies that they believe have a negative impact on the world. With sustainable investing, you can earn profits while avoiding companies that have a poor track record of hurting the environment or violating human rights. You can also proactively invest in companies and projects that are doing good in the world.There were more than 600 mutual funds and ETFs focused on sustainable investments as of 2022, according to US SIF: The Sustainable Investment Forum. Here are just a few examples of sustainable investment funds:You dont have to sacrifice profits to invest sustainably. Whether youre investing in mutual funds or ETFs or individual companies and projects, there are a number of ways to earn profits ethically. You can invest in funds or shares of companies based on whether they adhere to specific ESG criteria, or you can avoid investing in companies whose products and practices conflict with your values. Not only can you feel good about the fact that youre investing with a conscience, but some evidence suggests sustainable investing produces superior returns, particularly in the long run.You can invest sustainably by investing in ESG mutual funds and ETFs or by investing in companies that have strong ESG scores. You can also avoid companies that rank poorly on ESG criteria or that have a history of unethical practices. Some people choose to avoid certain types of companies altogether, such as those that make tobacco or firearms.Sustainable investing is a strategy where you aim to have a positive impact on the world. ESG investing and impact investing are two forms of sustainable investing. ESG investors use environmental, social and governance factors to determine whether an investment is sustainable. Impact investing is a strategy where the focus is achieving a measurable goal that benefits the planet or humanity, in addition to earning positive returns.First, make sure you define your values and what causes you care about, as well as any industries or business practices you consider unethical. If youre interested in mutual funds and ETFs, look for funds that invest according to the themes that matter to you or that screen out investments that conflict with your values. If you want to invest in individual companies, look at ESG ratings from third-party agencies, as well as those that are investing in projects you believe can have a positive long-term impact on the world.The editorial content on this page is based solely on objective, independent assessments by our writers and is not influenced by advertising or partnerships.

The shock caused in part by Russias war in Ukraine will transform the global energy industry. Governments in the West are looking to end their reliance on Russian oil and gas, which is giving a boost to climate-friendly alternatives. They include nuclear-power plants. Some countries, notably including Germany, remain fearful of another Chernobyl or Fukushima. But even when accounting for the high-profile disasters, nuclear power is very safe (see chart).A terawatt-hour (TWh) of electricity from nuclear energy is associated with 0.03 deaths (including indirect deaths from disasters and workplace accidents at the plants). That makes it even safer than wind energy, which is associated with 0.04 deaths per TWh, mostly from accidents during the installation process, drownings on offshore sites and helicopter collisions with turbines. Only solar energy is less deadly than nuclear. Coal is the deadliest because of the air pollution it causes: one TWh is linked to 24.6 deaths.As a rule, the safest energy sources are also the greenest. Nuclear energy produces just four tonnes of greenhouse gases per gigawatt-hour of electricity (GWh), the same as wind energy (this includes emissions from the mining of fuels, transportation and maintenance of a plant). Despite this, nuclear energy used for electricity production has been in decline since 2001 and now only accounts for a tenth of the global total. Fossil fuels still produce most of the worlds electricity: coal, gas and oil made up around 62% last year. The share of renewables has been growing over the last decade, yet wind energy makes up just 7% of the total and solar energy 4%.Nuclear energy has had an image problem for some time. Major accidents have made it seem more deadly than it is and the storage of nuclear waste remains controversial. But attitudes are shifting. Germany had planned to turn off its remaining three nuclear plants by the end of the year. Now, amid concerns about the countrys dependence on Russian gas and soaring energy prices, its government appears to be re-considering. Britain is constructing its first new nuclear plant in more than two decades. And in France, the government is set to pay 9.7bn ($9.9bn) to fully nationalise lectricit de France, one of the worlds biggest energy suppliers, to help fund six new nuclear reactors. Nuclear appears to be back in vogue.
"The perception that nuclear energy is dangerous is not true. It depends on the sector and the use because the technology we produce is for peaceful purposes and is suitable for people's daily use, such as in medicine and agriculture."We can use nuclear technology to solve problems. Mosti researchers, for example, are actively involved in solving problems related to food security," he said after opening the Mosti Targeted Promotion Programme here on Tuesday (Feb 27).He said the negative perception that nuclear technology was dangerous needed to be changed, in line with the implementation of the National Nuclear Technology Policy 2030 launched last September, Bernama reported.Malaysian Nuclear Agency director-general Dr Rosli Darmawan said in his welcome address that his agency had conducted various studies on the application of nuclear technology in various fields such as safety, environment, industry and manufacturing.


The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and Kairos Power have signed a Technology Investment Agreement to implement an Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) risk reduction award, for which the company was selected in December 2020, to support the design, construction, and commissioning of the Hermes demonstration reactor in Oak Ridge, Tenn.Under the agreement, DOE will provide up to $303 million to Kairos Power using a performance-based, fixed-price milestone approach. The the company will receive fixed payments upon demonstrating it has achieved significant project milestones.The contracting method has been used by the Department of Defense and follows the significant precedent in NASAs successful Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program. It has proven to be a flexible and effective model to support the development and demonstration of complex technologies through federal partnerships with commercial companies.Mike Laufer, Kairos Power co-founder and CEO said in a press statement, With the use of fixed-price milestone payments, this innovative contract provides real benefits to both Kairos Power and DOE to ensure the successful completion of the Hermes reactor. It allows us to remain focused on achieving the most important goals of the project while retaining agility and flexibility to move quickly as we learn key lessons through our iterative development approach.Emphasizing the importance of the contract award, Dr. Kathryn Huff, Assistant Secretary, Office of Nuclear Energy, said in a press statement, The Hermes reactor is an important step toward realizing advanced nuclear energys role in ushering forward the nations clean energy transition, said Partnerships like this one play a significant role in making advanced nuclear technology commercially competitive.On its website the firm said it has since being selected for the ARDP award, Kairos Power has made steady progress on its pathway to demonstration, standing up extensive testing and manufacturing infrastructure to deliver the Engineering Test Unit series and advancing its fuel and molten salt coolant workstreams.In December 2023, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued a construction permit to Kairos Power for the Hermes demonstration reactor. Hermes will demonstrate the companys ability to deliver clean, safe, and affordable nuclear heat and represents a critical step on Kairos Powers iterative pathway to commercializing its advanced reactor technology.(NucNet) AtkinsRalis and state-owned Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) have signed a memorandum of understanding to collaborate on deploying Candu nuclear power reactors around the world. The MOU will be followed by collaboration and licensing agreements that will accelerate the development of Candu reactor technology, including the large-scale1,000 MW Monark designthat was unveiled in November 2023.AtkinsRalis, a Montreal-based nuclear technology and engineering company that is part of Canadas SNC-Lavalin Group, told NucNet it is aiming to deploy its firstMonark nuclear plantin Canada by about 2034-2035 and is targeting markets as far afield as South America, Asia and Australia.CANDU reactor technology was developed in Canada in the 1950s and 1960s by a partnership that included AECL. According to the Canadian Nuclear Associations website, there are 34 Candu plants globally, 30 of which are operable. Nineteen of those plants are in Canada with the rest in Argentina, China, India, Pakistan, Romania and South Korea.AtkinsRalis said as the original equipment manufacturer and steward of CANDU technology, it partners with a nationwide nuclear supply chain of more than 250 companies that employ 76,000 people and provides fuel, components, services and tooling.The Monark, at 1,000 MW, is the most advanced reactor design with the highest output of any CANDU technology. AtkinsRalis said large-scale nuclear reactors are increasingly sought-after by utilities and governments as they look to decarbonize power grids, produce stable baseload power that is not weather-dependent and increase energy security.In September, the Canadian government agreed to provide export financing to support complet4ion of two CANDU reactors in Romania. These additional plants at the Cernavoda site would take nuclear powers share of Romanias electricity production to 36%.The Indian government is in talks with Reliance Industries, Tata Power, Adani Power, and Vedanta Ltd to invest nearly $5.30 billion each from them. The report, quoting two sources, mentioned the Department of Atomic Energy and the state-run Nuclear Power Corp. of India (NPCIL) have held multiple rounds of discussions with private companies in the past year on the investment plan. The government hopes to build 11,000 megawatts (MW) of new nuclear power generation capacity by 2040.This is the first time India is pursuing private investment in nuclear power. The funding would help India achieve its target of having 50% of its installed electric generation capacity use non-fossil fuels by 2030, up from 42% now.The government is asking the private companies will make investments in the nuclear plants, acquire land and water, and undertake construction in areas outside the reactor complex of the plants. However, the responsibility and rights to build and run the power stations and their fuel management will rest with NPCIL. However, the private companies are expected to earn revenue from the power plants electricity sales, and NPCIL would operate the projects for a fee.According to a Reuters wire service report, in August 2023, Minister of State Jitendra Singh also told the countrys parliament that the government was considering options for small modular reactors, and looking at ways to allow the participation of the private sector and start-ups in such projects.India is currently building a fleet of 10 700 MW PHWR nuclear power plants using a 100% India supply chain for the domestic designed CANDU type reactor. Anther seven units are planned once the first ten are complete. India has blocked foreign direct investment in its nuclear sector by passing a supplier liability law that blocks all but state owned enterprises that self-insure. Westinghouse and GE Hitachi exited the market as a resultRussia has built and commissioned two 1000 MW VVER reactors at Kudankulam in Tamil Nadu, is building two more, and has recently completed discussions with NPCIL for a third pair at the same site. Efforts by Frances EDF to build six 1650 MW EPRs at Jaitapur on Indias west coast have been stalled for more than a decade over objections by NPCIL about costs.At $6,000/Mw the two EPR reactors would cost almost $20 billion. By comparison, India claims to be building its 700 MW PHWRs for about half that amount or about $2 billion each. Roughly speaking, India could build its entire fleet of 10 PHWRs for the cost of the twin EPRs not counting cost and schedule delays for the EPRs which have a poor track record in terms of project controls.South Korea will invest in developing its the small modular reactor (SMR) foundry business. President Yoon Suk Yeol said at a town hall meeting in Changwon that the government will develop the southeastern city ofChangwonand its surrounding area South Gyeongsang Province into an SMR manufacturing hub.Changwon will see the countrys new SMR cluster, trade, industry and energy minister Ahn Duk-geun said at the presidents town hall meeting. The city is full of companies with superb nuclear power equipment manufacturing capabilities.Since SMRs are expected to be manufactured and installed in modular forms, the plan is to produce them at factories. Given the limited number of countries with nuclear reactor manufacturing technology, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said the government will step up policy efforts to take the lead in the SMR market.The government significantly increases the budget to develop and export small modular reactors by 2028 by more than nine times to about $49 billion this year. It plans to launch South Korean SMRs in the global market. South Korea has several PWR type designs for SMRs that are in the development stage. It is also a possibility that South Korean heavy industry firms may license SMR designs already or nearly complete in other countries.The government will also offer tax benefits to SMR and nuclear power plant manufacturers. The trade ministry estimates that such tax benefits will lead to an increase in R&D spending and facility investment in the sector by more than $750 million this year alone.The government has earmarked $3 billion for next-generation nuclear power plant R&D through 2027 when President Yoons five-year term ends. This year, the government also plans to draw up a mid- to long-term policy roadmap to support the nuclear energy sector, upon legislation of the special act for the nuclear power industry.Rolls-Royce has been promoting its 470 MW PWR type mid-size reactor as a solution to the nations energy needs. The firm has presented a plans for 16 of them to be built at various sites around the nation.However, the process to select which model of small nuclear reactor, among a field of six competitors, is used in Britain has been beset by delays. Bureaucratic disputes about funding and policy issues has tied up a plan to make multiple awards of significant funding for SMRs. A prior SMR competition in 2015 ended without any significant awards of funding.As a result of the current delays,Tufan Erginbilgic, CEO at Rolls-Royce, says that the first Rolls-Royce mini nuclear reactor will be built in Europe instead of Britain if UK ministers continue on a path of failure to make up their minds about SMRs.Erginbilgic said he was confident the companys small modular reactor (SMR) technology was still far ahead of competitors. He told the Telegraph newspaper that time was running out for the UK to benefit from its first mover advantage, as Rolls has also held talks about deploying SMRs in eastern Europe.His claims about market advantage in Poland, Romania, and other countries need to be taken with grain or two of salt as several other firms including GE-Hitachi and NuScale, among others, have made inroads in developing sale prospects with these nations.Erginbilgics complaints come asGreat British Nuclear(GBN), the public body set up to lead the UKs nuclear power revival, is preparing to choose which SMR prototypes to support from a shortlist of six companies, including Rolls-Royce. GBN had promised to make the awards this spring, but that date is now in doubt according to news reports.In the UK, the company is the only SMR developer to have reached the second stage of the new generic design assessment process for nuclear reactors, with CEO Erginbilgic arguing this puts it in pole position in the GBN competition.Westinghouse Electric Company announced the signing of a contract with the Dutch government to conduct a Technical Feasibility Study (TFS) assessing the deployment of AP1000 reactors in support of their nuclear new-build strategy.This comprehensive study will evaluate deployment of two AP1000 nuclear reactors at theBorssele Nuclear Power Station. The TFS represents a significant step forward in the countrys strategy to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, aligning with the European Unions climate goals and the Dutch commitment to carbon-neutral electricity production by 2035.Borssele, in the province of Zeeland in the southwest of the Netherlands, is the countrys only commercial nuclear power station. It has a single 482-MW pressurized water reactor unit that began commercial operation in 1973. In December 2022 the Dutch government chose the Borssele site as its preferred location for the proposed construction of two new nuclear power reactor units. The government is also considering reactors from Frances EDF, South Koreas KHNP, and Westinghouse. Reactors from Russia or China are not under consideration.(NucNet) The construction of the first phase of China National Nuclear Corporations Jinqimen nuclear power station has officially begun in Zhejiang province, eastern China. The Jinqimen-1 and -2 project will have two indigenous Hualong One, or HPR1000 pressurized water reactor units.Hualong One (HPR 1000) is the 3rd-generation nuclear power brand to which China has exclusive intellectual property rights. HPR 1000 is jointly developed by the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) and the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN).It has a 177 assembly core design with an 18-month refuelling cycle with 4.45% enriched fuel. The power plants utilization rate is as high as 90%. CNNC has said its active and passive safety systems, double-layer containment and other technologies meet the highest international safety standards.Chinese state owned news media reports are that all core components are manufactured in China and that 17 universities and research institutions, 58 state-owned enterprises, and over 140 private firms across China worked on Hualong Ones development to ensure all core components were able to be produced domesticallyThe Kairos reactor is pushing-the-envelope in a whole host of technical, safety, and operational areas. The economics of the approach cannot be evaluated owing to the very high levels of uncertainty just noted.I cannot help but suspect this is yet another example of a heavily taxpayer funded DOE research effort unlikely to succeed in the commercial marketplace. The cost of the long-line of earlier DOE misadventures is in the ten-of-billions of dollars. Perhaps the scientists should take a more pragmatic approach.If you have an experience or insight to share or have learned something from a conference or seminar, your peers and colleagues on Energy Central want to hear about it.

The then-Labor leader's courageous plan to overhaul negative gearing, capital gains tax and franking credit rules, helped Scott Morrison win the "unwinnable" election. It led to a consensus that oppositions were better off playing it safe on policy and instead trying to win votes by keeping the focus on government failures.Two weeks ago, when the prime minister first announced his broken promise on Stage 3, Dutton demanded an early election. Liberal MPs variously described Labor's re-jigged tax cuts as class warfare, regressive, shameful, inflationary, and Marxist economics (as the prime minister gleefully listed yesterday).Dutton had little choice but to back in the bigger tax cuts for low-and-middle-income earners. And he managed to avoid a damaging internal row over the capitulation. His colleagues largely agreed this was the least bad option.A handful of Liberals would have preferred to "stand and have a fight" rather than "roll over and get smashed in Question Time", as one disappointed MP privately put it, but this would have given the government exactly what it wanted: a drawn-out fight in which the Coalition would be belted for standing in the way of cost-of-living support.To keep faith with those disappointed at the Coalition running up the white flag, Dutton insisted he's still committed to the "principles" of the original Stage 3 plan. That means greater tax relief for those earning more than $146,000 a year, who receive less under Labor's changes.As the Opposition Leader acknowledges, returning the full amount to those at the top would cost around $9 billion a year. Even returning a significant chunk will require potentially unpopular spending cuts elsewhere if the Coalition doesn't want to blow the budget.The Opposition Leader has already pledged to reverse Labor's tax hike for big superannuation accounts. From mid-next year, earnings on super balances of more than $3 million will be taxed at 30 per cent rather than 15 per cent. Reinstating the more generous tax rate will cost the Coalition around $2 billion a year.There's strong support in the opposition to lift the ban on nuclear power in Australia, but given the costs involved, it may take more than that for nuclear to become a viable alternative to renewables.The details of the Coalition's policy are yet to come, but Shadow Minister for Climate Change and Energy Ted O'Brien has raised the prospect of taxpayer-subsidised nuclear reactors. "There's no doubt that you need government involved," he says.The Nationals, who this week have been pushing for a blanket suspension of wind and solar projects in regional areas, are most gung-ho about the nuclear alternative. Liberals (who need to hold and win back urban seats) aren't exactly rushing to back the idea of a renewables ban, suggesting the old Coalition wars over climate and energy policy, on show in Monday night's second episode of the ABC docuseries Nemesis, aren't entirely resolved.The Coalition is also talking tough on industrial relations, suggesting the government's changes on multi-employer bargaining, labour hire, right of entry provisions, and casual employees are holding back the economy.Whether all this talk results in genuine campaign bravery from Peter Dutton is yet to be seen. We may end up with modest proposals, a small target strategy, and an effort to keep the focus on Anthony Albanese's "lies".But if the Opposition leader does go the election promising significant tax cuts for the top, sweeping spending cuts, subsidised nuclear power, and an industrial relations roll back, we could be in for quite a policy contest.
Its been close to 40 years since more than 100,000 people were evacuated from the area surrounding Chernobyl, and while that region is still considered inhospitable to human beings, the wolves that call it home have apparently developed a very intriguing trait.As you likely know, the meltdown that struck Chernobyl in 1986 is considered the worst incident in the history of nuclear energy due to the ramifications that couldve been much, much worse if the Soviets hadnt scrambled to address the deadly threats that stemmed from their own bureaucratic incompetence.The official death toll for the disaster sits at 30 due to people who perished after being exposed to lethal levels of radiation, although it is believed thousands more have or will eventually pass away from cancer that can be traced back to the fallout of what unfolded at the power plant.Ukraine is still home to a 1,000-square-mile area known as the Exclusion Zone that humans will be unable to inhabit for at least 3,000 years, and while there was a mass culling of animals in the region following the disaster, plenty of wildlife eventually made its way back into the impacted woodlands.That includes the mutant wolves that have attracted the interest of scientists whove spent decades conducting Chernobyl-adjacent researchincluding Cara Love, an evolutionary biologist at Princeton who was part of a team that managed to affix collars to the animals in 2014 to measure the levels of radiation theyre exposed to.According to Sky News, the data shows the wolves are subjected to 11.28 millirem of radiation on a daily basis, which the outlet notes is six times the level that is deemed safe for humans. You might assume that would result in a proliferation of cancer in the population, but it appears the animals have adapted to their hostile environment.Love said her research shows the wolves have not only developed altered immune systems similar to cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment but that blood tests she and her team have run have detected genetic mutations that appear to reduce the risk of cancer.Theres hope that theyll be able to use the evidence theyve obtained to further work concerning cancer prevention and treatment in humans, so its good to hear something positive could possibly come out of an otherwise disastrous situation.
Nearly 700 employees at the Columbia Fuel Fabrication Facility, located 25 minutes southeast of Columbia, South Carolina, are set to vote on whether to form a union represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW). The election is scheduled for Feb. 29, March 1 and March 2.The IBEW filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) late last month requesting a union election. More than half of 673 eligible employees have already signed cards pledging to support the organizing drive, HuffPost has learned. The plant has a total workforce of nearly 900.The union push marks the second attempt in the past few years to rally the plants workers to collectively bargain a contract. That the facility isnt already unionized is rather unusual for the nuclear power industry.Just 6% of employees in the U.S. private sector are represented by unions. But more than a third of workers in the nuclear energy industry are organized, according to a 2017 survey conducted by the IBEW, resulting in wages that typically exceed those in renewable energy or fossil fuels. That number has stayed mostly flat  or possibly declined  as nuclear power plants shut down in recent years and laid off workers. But South Carolina has long had the lowest rate of unionization in the nation  a streak U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data confirmed again last month  thanks to laws that favor employers over workers.The factory is one of three owned by the Pennsylvania-based nuclear giant Westinghouse Electric Company, but the only one without a unionized workforce. The other two fuel-fabrication facilities are in England and Sweden.But organized labor bookends the U.S. supply chain. The Blairsville, Pennsylvania, factory where Westinghouse churns out the parts the workers in South Carolina are using to assemble the fuel rods is a union plant. That fuel often ends up in reactors operated by union workers at the federally-owned Tennessee Valley Authoritys fleet of nuclear power plants.As a union member, I take pride knowing that the fuel rods we load into our core at Watts Bar have been touched by union members at the beginning of the process, Trip Geiger, an IBEW-represented assistant reactor operator at the Watts Bar nuclear plant in Tennessee, said in a promotional video the union made to boost the organizing drive in South Carolina. Id like to be able to say theyre touched at the middle of the process, from production to assembly at your plant to installing those same fuel rods in our core and producing power.Following decades of static demand as nuclear energy fell into decline, the U.S. is inching toward building more reactors at home and overseas as the world races to wean off fossil fuels and find alternatives to solar and wind power that use less land and minerals  and produce much steadier and higher volumes of electricity.The U.S. is even challenging Moscows near-monopoly on exports of nuclear technology and uranium, with Westinghouse now manufacturing fuel rods that work in the Russian-designed reactors used widely in Eastern Europe.What I try to tell people at the plant is now would be the time to organize because we certainly have the upper hand, said the worker, who spoke to HuffPost on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal from management. This isnt an industry where you can just hire anybody to replace people, it takes training.The Columbia Fuel Fabrication Facility first attempted to unionize decades ago. Employees there most recently made an organizing push in 2018, a year after Westinghouse  then owned by the Japanese industrial giant Toshiba  filed for bankruptcy amid mounting billion-dollar cost overruns on a project to build the first of a new kind of reactor at a power plant in Georgia.At the time, older workers at the facility worried the organizing drive would cost them their retirement plans. The IBEW only takes on campaigns if the 10% of the workforce inside the facility volunteer to help organize the rest of the company, a threshold the union said the Westinghouse plant failed to reach until last spring.But workers soon saw their pensions werent safe anyway. Westinghouse eliminated employee pensions as part of its financial restructuring, and workers saw that was much easier to do in South Carolina than at the plant in Blairsville.After the failed unionization effort six years ago, Westinghouse began implementing draconian shift schedules and forcing employees to work seven days in a row to benefit from overtime on weekends, according to the IBEW and the worker HuffPost interviewed. Workers typically earn high salaries, they said. However, the health insurance changed to one that provided less coverage. When teams at the plant asked the company to hire more workers to help with the growing demand, the employee said management rebuffed the request, saying there wasnt enough money.Its funny, the amount of money that I see them waste on projects that dont work out or were totally wrong from the state, it might be $100,000 or more and nobody bats an eye at that, the worker said. But if you ask for more time off or say, Hey, we can use a few more people to help lighten the load, its, We cant do that, we dont have the money to do that.HR didnt have to show up every day. The front office didnt have to show up every day. But they sure did, she said of the industrial workers at the plant. So it really empowered them and made them realize, This place doesnt run without us. They cant survive without us.In a speech, two days after the union filed paperwork with the NLRB, Republican Gov. Henry McMaster said, One thing we do not need is more labor unions in the state, according to the South Carolina Daily Gazette, which first reported on the petition last week.McMaster was referring to an ongoing legal fight with the International Longshoremens Association over securing union contracts for crane operators at the Port of Charleston. Asked by the nonprofit news outlet about the Westinghouse campaign, a spokesperson for the GOP governor said all unions represent a clear danger to our prosperity. (Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is running for the Republican presidential nomination in part on her union-busting record.)But Westinghouse paid its former top executive Daniel Roderick $19 million the year before he was pushed out of his seat as chairman of the board amid the companys previous financial collapse in 2017. Westinghouse emerged from Chapter 11 protections in 2018 when Toshiba sold the company to the private equity giant Brookfield.In 2022, a joint venture between the Canadian uranium-mining behemoth Cameco and Brookfield Renewable Partners, a subsidiary of the private equity firm that owns zero-carbon energy assets, bought Westinghouse in what was widely seen as a bullish bet on the future of nuclear power. The deal closed in November.Since then, anytime the managers provide an update on the companys finances at all-hands meetings, the fuel-fabrication division is always in the green while the other services Westinghouse provides are usually in the yellow or red, the longtime South Carolina facility worker said.Our plant especially is the money maker for Westinghouse. Weve been told that for years, that our plant almost single-handedly keeps Westinghouse afloat, the worker said. The fact is, they need us right now.At HuffPost, we believe that everyone needs high-quality journalism, but we understand that not everyone can afford to pay for expensive news subscriptions.

The National Rally Against Reckless Renewables is on the first sitting day of Parliament, Tuesday, 6th February 2024, at 10am in front of Parliament House. This peaceful rally is grassroots, representing many diverse regional communities who are directly and adversely affected by the Australian Governments reckless rollout of renewables. We urge the Federal and State Governments to cease their reckless rollout of unreliable, unaffordable, and environmentally destructive wind, solar, limited firming batteries, and high-voltage transmission lines, amidst an ever-increasing demand for reliable electricity.Currently, there are over 1000 new renewable projects in the governments Powering Our Nation pipeline (Source AEMO, 2023). Almost all of these are located in Regional Australia. In the lead-up to most of these projects, this government has conducted short, insincere, and unacknowledged community consultation. Exploiting the fact that most of these projects are located in or near coastal, farming, and traditional communities with small populations, the government continues to disregard our concerns. In many cases, our right to judicial review or appeal has or will be removed.Australian consumers, taxpayers, and industries require an electricity network that is efficient, safe, reliable, secure, and affordable. It is critical for Australia, now and in the future, to establish a network that does not damage our unique environment, particularly productive agricultural land, fisheries, and native habitats.This governments reckless rollout of renewables poses a significant threat to our nation, threatening food production for Australians and 80 million consumers globally. Our fauna and flora are facing unprecedented destruction, as hundreds of thousands of hectares of land and ocean floors are being deforested and/or damaged. It is posing a threat to our economy, costing over $121 billion (AEMO, 2023). There are documented serious supply chain and sustainment issues, and therefore reliability risks, potentially leading to mass blackouts. Massive taxpayer subsidies and electricity bills will flow offshore for decades to the many greenwashed multinationals lined up for these subsidised investments.This rally is a coalition of grassroots community groups united under the National Rational Energy Network. We call upon the Australian Government to:1. Conduct an urgent Senate Inquiry: Establish a Senate Inquiry to scrutinise the technical veracity as well as the excessive economic, social and environmental costs of renewables, and the escalating risks to our national interest and security. This includes reviewing the committed, anticipated, actionable and future projects being fast-tracked by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment, and Water, in particular the Capacity Investment Scheme, Rewiring the Nation, Offshore Wind Projects, and expanding unelected overreaching organisations including the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, Climate Change Authority, Clean Energy Finance Corporation, Australian Energy Market Operator, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, and Clean Energy Council.2. Suspend all renewable energy projects: We call on the Australian Government to convene the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) Energy Council and request all states and territories suspend wind, solar, hydro and associated transmission construction until the above Senate Inquiry reports.3. Lift the ban on nuclear power: Nuclear energy has the lowest overall greenhouse gas emissions of any energy source as a result of its low land footprint, low material usage, and low waste output. The current ban is archaic, restraining Australia from achieving a strong reliable energy future.This is a national grassroots call for a responsible and sustainable approach to our energy future. We urge the Australian government to prioritise the well- being of our environment, communities, and the future of our nation.[10.00am Mr Grant Piper] [10.10am Ms Gemma Pride] [10.20am Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price] [10.30am Mr Craig Kelly] [10.40am Senator Ralph Babet] [10.50am Senator Ross Cadell] [11.00am Hon Barnaby Joyce MP] [11.10am The Hon Dr David Gillespie MP] [11.20 Senator the Hon.

Aboriginals speaking about desecration of sacred land during the building wind turbines are about as welcome in Aussie mainstream media as black power people supporting Trump are in the US mainstream media.Jacinta Price is one of Australias star politicians. She and her mother Bess Price (and families) are from Alice Springs and deserve high-praise for standing resolutely on principles that have nothing to do with race.No Bill, Jacinta is an evil Alt White and does not correctly represent the traditional owners who have had 100,000 years of perfect harmony on this continent which clearly involved sustainable farming in large permanent towns and had nothing to do with killing off all the megafauna and/or burning down so much of the forests that the rainfall patterns changed. Clearly.Did we get the Completely Unrelated Third Party Who No One Has Heard Of Before Or Invited that can march up in neo 1930s Euro cosplay and decisively prove to the MSM that the entire rally was funded by. (gasp) the Alt Right!! ?5- 30 meters deep) sea sponge. (A meaning from a limited sampled area a small part part of, NOT the whole Caribbean. My beach collected sponge spicules are all shallow origin.) Down where we already know thermocline temperatures are affected by ocean currents. And where we also know sea sponge spicule chemistry is at best a sketchy proxy for temperature alonewhich is why previously sea sponges almost never were used before as a temp proxy. Not even by Mann, Marcott, or Pages2.Novel but sketchy narrow geographic proxy extrapolated to usual alarmist global result. Very climate sciency. Alarmists are now probably scraping the bottom of their rotten climate science Apple barrel.The net zero agenda is so farcical it might be prudent to bring along a troop of clowns, comedians and cartoonists who are best able to explain and depict the logic of the government programs for net zero.I contributed to one of their meetings, they were talking about amalgamating into a single organisation, and I suggested not to. I said whoever is head of that organisation will make themselves a target, that a brush fire is the hardest kind of fire to fight, because there is no single place our opponents can focus to put it out.Naturally theyre getting the silent treatment from mainstream media, or when mentioned are dismissed as cranks and extremists, but their demands are actually quite moderate. For example, though some are totally against renewables, many of the participants are OK with powerlines being built, but they want them built underground, where they wont bother anyone.I contributed to one of their meetings, they were talking about amalgamating into a single organisation, and I suggested not to.

Well Im a part of that grass roots movement and trust me it has grown substantially over the past five years to well over a hundred different groups. What people forget is that Australia is a huge continent with a relatively small population so we are never going to be able to hold rallies like those in Europe. They are geographically small countries with large populations.There were attendees from parts of Queensland, Victoria and South Australia which means they travelled there by plane most likely. Those from within NSW would still have had many hours of driving to get to Canberra as well as one or two nights accommodation. My point is that to attend the rally was costly and took valuable time out of a farmers work schedule. We were impressed with the attendance of the people who put in so much valuable time, effort and personal expense to get the attention of the politicians on their first day back in parliament.Getup, which is along the same lines as the Antifa dress up crowd, tried to intimidate us with a flood of messages stating that they would effectively take over the rally with their presence and were asking their supporters for $12 donations towards signs that would outnumber ours at the rally. No one turned up! Then they had the gall to put out a message that theyd basically shut us down. All lies! We experienced none of the opposition we had expected.We had amazing support from politicians speaking up for us as well as farmers and others from the regions who spoke really well. Peter Ridd spoke too, a name that you would all be familiar with. The government now know that there is considerable opposition to their renewables plan. And as we are many groups united it will not be easy for them to shut us down.

Celeste Wallander, assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs, told Clifford May, president of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, that U.S. aid to Ukraine has global impacts.Russia invaded neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 22, 2021. Russian forces were larger and better equipped, but Ukrainian forces stopped them from capturing the capital of Kyiv and decapitating the government and installing a puppet regime that answered to Russian President Vladimir Putin.The United States has provided $43 billion in support to Ukraine, covering everything from Javelin missiles to tanks to ambulances to long-range strike missiles to air defense capabilities and much, much more. U.S. service members are training Ukrainian forces in Europe and the United States. Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III formed and still leads the Ukraine Defense Security Group which now has 50 nations that contribute to Ukraine's defense.This aid is key to helping Ukrainian forces take on and, in many areas, push back the Russians. U.S. government officials said in January that more than 300,000 Russians have been killed or wounded in Ukraine.Wallander said the United States wants a Ukraine that is sovereign, independent and secure, adding that the Ukrainian people do not want Russian overlords and are fighting for their freedom. "We want the Ukrainian people to be able to live the European life they have chosen," she said during the discussion.While supporting Ukraine is the right thing to do, U.S. support is about more than just Ukraine, Wallander said. "[Our support] is about the international order that keeps all countries and all populations safe, including Russia," she said.Built into the fabric of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is the agreement that nuclear powers will respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of other countries and agree to support the peaceful use of nuclear energy for their prosperity. "All of that is at stake in Russia's invasion and occupation of Ukraine," she said.                Army Sgt. Alejandro Anguiano, a loader assigned to Bravo Barbarian Company, 2nd Battalion, 69th Armored Regiment Panther Battalion, 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division supporting NATOs enhanced Forward Presence Battle Group Poland, boresights the M1A2 Abrams main gun during Exercise Iron Spear in Adazi, Latvia, Nov. 13, 2023. Iron Spear included a firepower demonstration involving troops from Canada, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the U.S. The 3rd Infantry Divisions mission in Europe is to engage in multinational training and exercises across the continent, working alongside NATO allies and regional security partners to provide combat-credible forces to V Corps, Americas forward deployed corps in Europe.China has supported Russia in its illegal invasion, and the Asian nation has benefited from Russia's increasing isolation. "The Chinese leadership doesn't want Putin to lose, because of what that would mean about the strength of the international community in pushing back against a bully," she said.Beyond the geopolitical reasons for supporting Ukraine, there are very human reasons, as well. The Russian invasion has been incredibly brutal, with indiscriminate attacks on civilians throughout the country. Wallander noted that Russian brutality has not been limited to Ukraine. The Russian military has used the same tactics in Chechnya and Georgia.But in Ukraine, Russia has gone beyond merely targeting civilian infrastructure. Russia has been taking Ukrainian children from their families or taking orphans and sending them to Russia. It is an almost "Nazi-like idea of ethnic purity that they need to be educated as Russians and that they are somehow going to be re-educated and brought back to benefit the Russian Federation," Wallander said. "It is just astonishing to think that a Europe, which faced the horror of such a leadership doing that to populations in the 1940s, is now confronted with another leadership that is doing that  in the 2020s."

Some high points have come in 2007, 2015, 2017, and 2024. Each time it has been absolutely critical to attack Iran at once. There could be no delay. Dominoes would fall. Terrorism would prevail. Credibility would be sqandered. And yet, each time, the threatened war has not been launched, and the world has gone on just the same.Weve seen a wide variety of excuses deployed over these years of unsuccessful propaganda for a war on Iran, including false claims about nuclear weapons, the pretense that attacking Iran would improve civil liberties within Iran, and shockingly honest commitments to gaining control of more oil with which to slowly destroy the habitability of the Earth. The push to attack Iran has been on for so long that entire categories of arguments for it (such as that the Iranians are fueling the Iraqi resistance) and demonized leaders of Iran have come and gone. The latest excuse is the killing of three members of the U.S. military.Ordinarily, killing people could be prosecuted as a crime. But thats tricky, because the United States government opposes and refuses to take part in international law, the U.S. troops had no legal justification for being where they were, and the violence across the region is being driven by U.S. support for enormous crimes by the Israeli government.More importantly, the advocates for war do not want to prosecute a crime, but to use a crime as an excuse to commit much larger crimes, on the familiar model of September 11, October 7, etc. The choice to escalate is not imposed on anyone; similar situations in the past have been used as excuses for war and also allowed to pass without the launching of any war.The U.S. government purports to believe that escalating wars will reduce wars, flying in the face of the overwhelming evidence of centuries, and to believe that there is no alternative, even though the demands of all sorts of warmakers across Western Asia are all the same and extremely easy to satisfy (and satisfying them has been ordered by the International Court of Justice): stop destroying Gaza and killing Gazans.The U.S. government distorts the notion of defense beyond all recognition by claiming that harm done to its imperial troops anywhere on Earth can justify a defensive war. This is highly convenient for war hawks in Washington, D.C., who have known for many years that getting U.S. troops killed can be a big propaganda boost for war madness  an idea eagerly encouraged today by U.S. media outlets that are always perfectly capable of demanding revenge while simulaneously calling it defense.This is what the empire of U.S. military bases looks like to Iran. Try to imagine if you lived there, what you would think of this. Who is threatening whom? Who is the greater danger to whom? The point is not that Iran should be free to attack the United States or anyone else because its military is smaller. The point is that doing so would be national suicide. It would also be something Iran has not done for centuries. But it would be typical U.S. behavior.The U.S. overthrew Irans democracy in 1953 and installed a brutal dictator / weapons customer. The U.S. gave Iran nuclear energy technology in the 1970s. Following the Iranian revolution, the United States aided Iraq in the 1980s in attacking Iran, providing Iraq with some of the weapons (including chemical weapons) that were used on Iranians and that would be used in 2002-2003 (when they no longer existed) as an excuse for attacking Iraq.The roots of a Washington push for a new war on Iran can be found in the 1992 Defense Planning Guidance, the 1996 paper called A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm, the 2000 Rebuilding Americas Defenses, and in a 2001 Pentagon memo described by Wesley Clark as listing these nations for attack: Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Lebanon, Syria, and Iran. Its worth noting that Bush Jr. overthrew Iraq, and Obama Libya, while the others remain works in progress. The arguments in these old forgotten memos were not what the war makers tell the public, but much closer to what they tell each other. The concerns were those of dominating regions rich in resources, intimidating others, and establishing bases from which to maintain control of puppet governments.In 2000, the CIA gave Iran nuclear bomb plans in an effort to frame it. This was reported by James Risen, and Jeffrey Sterling went to prison for allegedly being Risens source. But nobody involved in the scheme was ever punished in any way.In 2010, Tony Blair included Iran on a list of countries that he said Dick Cheney had aimed to overthrow. The line among the powerful in Washington in 2003 was that Iraq would be a cakewalk but that real men go to Tehran.For many years, the United States has labeled Iran an evil nation, attacked and destroyed the other non-nuclear nation on the list of evil nations, designated part of Irans military a terrorist organization, falsely accused Iran of crimes including the attacks of 9-11, murdered Iranian scientists, funded opposition groups in Iran (including some the U.S. also designates as terrorist), flew dronesover Iran, openly and illegally threatened to attack Iran, and built up military forces all around Irans borders, while imposing cruel sanctions on the country. The long history of the United States lying about Iranian nuclear weapons is chronicled by Gareth Porters book Manufactured Crisis.In 2007, we were told that Iran needed to be attacked urgently due to false claims about nuclear weapons. Even a National Intelligence Estimate in 2007 pushed back and admitted that Iran had no nuclear weapons program.In 2015, Republicans urged war justified by Irans nuclear weapons program, while Democrats successfully moved for passage of an agreement with Iran, also justified by Irans nuclear weapons program. The agreement was not a treaty, and President Trump would later throw it out. But the damage of both sides falsely claiming that Iran had a nuclear weapons program was done.Dick and Liz Cheneys book, Exceptional, tell us we must see a moral difference between an Iranian nuclear weapon and an American one. Must we, really? Either risks further proliferation, accidental use, use by a crazed leader, mass death and destruction, environmental disaster, retaliatory escalation, and apocalypse. One of those two nations has nuclear weapons, has used nuclear weapons, has provided the other with plans for nuclear weapons, has a policy of first-use of nuclear weapons, has leadership that sanctions the possession of nuclear weapons, and has frequently threated to use nuclear weapons. I dont think those facts would make a nuclear weapon in the hands of the other country the least bit moral, but also not the least bit more immoral. Lets focus on seeing an empiricaldifference between an Iranian nuclear weapon and an American one. One exists. The other doesnt.If youre wondering, U.S. presidents who have made specific public or secret nuclear threats to other nations, that we know of, as documented in Daniel Ellsbergs The Doomsday Machine, have included Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump, while others, including Barack Obama and Donald Trump have frequently said things like All options are on the table in relation to Iran or another country.Proponents of war or steps toward war (sanctions was a step toward the war on Iraq) say we urgently need a war on Iran now, but they have no argument for urgency, and theyve been making the same argument with ever less credibility for years.The Trump White House early on openly expressed a desire to claim that Iran had violated the 2015 nuclear agreement, but produced no evidence. It didnt matter. Trump tore up the agreement anyway and used his own shredding of the agreement as grounds for nuclear fearmongering about Iran.In 2017, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations claimed that Iranian weapons had been used in a war that the U.S.., Saudi Arabia, and allies were illegally and disastrously waging in Yemen. While thats a problem that should be corrected, it is hard to find a war anywhere on the planet without U.S. weapons in it. In fact, a report that made news the same day as the ambassadors claims, pointed to the long-known fact that many of the weapons used by ISIS had once belonged to the United States, many of them having been given by the U.S. to non-state fighters (aka terrorists) in Syria.Fighting wars and arming others to fight wars/terrorism is a justification for indictment and prosecution, but not for war, legally, morally, or practically. The United States fights and arms wars, and no one would be justified in attacking the United States.If Iran is guilty of a crime, and there is evidence to support that claim, the United States and the world should seek its prosecution. Instead, the United States is isolating itself by tearing down the rule of law.President Biden came into office with the possibility wide open to restore the Iran agreement and pursue a better course. He chose not to do so, and not to even try to do so. He waited for a less amendable government to take power in Iran, and then did seemingly everything he could to stir up hostitlities in the region. Now an agreement looks much more difficult to obtain.Of course the reason why real men go to Tehran is that Iran is not the impoverished disarmed nation that one might find in, say, Afghanistan or Iraq, or even the disarmed nation found in Libya in 2011. Iran is much bigger and much better armed. Whether the United States launches a major assault on Iran or Israel does, Iran will retaliate against U.S. troops and probably Israel and possibly the United States itself as well. And the United States will without any doubt re-retaliate for that. Iran cannot be unaware that the U.S. governments pressure on the Israeli government not to attack Iran consists of reassuring the Israelis that the United States will attack when needed, and does not include even threatening to stop funding Israels military or to stop vetoing measures of accountability for Israeli crimes at the United Nations.Of course, many in the U.S. government and military oppose attacking Iran, although key figures like Admiral William Fallon have been moved out of the way. Much of the Israeli military is opposed as well, not to mention the Israeli and U.S. people. But war is not clean or precise. If the people we allow to run our nations attack another, we are all put at risk.Most at risk, of course, are the people of Iran, people as peaceful as any other, or perhaps more so. As in any country, no matter what its government, the people of Iran are fundamentally good, decent, peaceful, just, and fundamentally like you and me. Ive met people from Iran. You may have met people from Iran. They look like this. Theyre not a different species. Theyre not evil. A surgical strike against a facility in their country would cause a great many of them to die very painful and horrible deaths. Even if you imagine that Iran would not retaliate for such attacks, this is what the attacks would in themselves consist of: mass murder.And what would that accomplish? It would unite the people of Iran and much of the world against the United States. It would justify in the eyes of much of the world an underground Iranian program to develop nuclear weapons, a program that probably does not exist at present, except to the extent that legal nuclear energy programs move a country closer to weapons development. The environmental damage would be tremendous, the precedent set incredibly dangerous, all talk of cutting the U.S. military budget would be buried in a wave of war frenzy, civil liberties and representative government would be flushed down the Potomac, a nuclear arms race would spread to additional countries, and any momentary sadistic glee would be outweighed by accelerating home foreclosures, mounting student debt, and accumulating layers of cultural stupidity.Strategically, legally, and morally weapons possession is not grounds for war, and neither is pursuit of weapons possession. And neither, I might add, with Iraq in mind, is theoretically possible pursuit of weapons never acted upon. Israel has nuclear weapons. The United States has more nuclear weapons than any other country but Russia (the two of them together have 90% of the worlds nukes). There can be no justification for attacking the United States, Israel, or any other country. The pretense that Iran has or will soon have nuclear weapons is, in any case, just a pretense, one that has been revived, debunked, and revived again like a zombie for years and years. But thats not the really absurd part of this false claim for something that amounts to no justification for war whatsoever.The really absurd part is that it was the United States in 1976 that pushed nuclear energy on Iran. In 2000 the CIA gave the Iranian government (slightly flawed) plans to build a nuclear bomb. In 2003, Iran proposed negotiations with the United States with everything on the table, including its nuclear technology, and the United States refused. Shortly thereafter, the United States started angling for a war. Meanwhile, U.S.-led sanctions prevent Iran from developing wind energy, while the Koch brothers are allowed to trade with Iran without penalty.Another area of ongoing lie debunking, one that almost exactly parallels the buildup to the 2003 attack on Iraq, is the relentless false claim, including by candidates in 2012 for U.S. President, that Iran has not allowed inspectors into its country or given them access to its sites. Iran had, in fact, prior to the agreement voluntarily accepted stricter standards than the IAEA requires. And of course a separate line of propaganda, albeit a contradictory one, holds that the IAEA has discovered a nuclear weapons program in Iran. Under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), Iran was not required to declare all of its installations, and early last decade it chose not to, as the United States violated that same treaty by blocking Germany, China, and others from providing nuclear energy equipment to Iran. While Iran remains in compliance with the NPT, India and Pakistan and Israel have not signed it and North Korea has withdrawn from it, while the United States and other nuclear powers continuously violate it by failing to reduce arms, by providing arms to other countries such as India, and by developing new nuclear weapons, not to mention keeping nuclear weapons in six European countries, providing Russia to put them into one European country as well.Are you ready for an even more absurd twist? This is on the same scale as Bushs comment about not really giving much thought to Osama bin Laden. Are you ready? The proponents of attacking Iran themselves admit that if Iran had nukes it would not use them. This is from the American Enterprise Institute:The biggest problem for the United States is not Iran getting a nuclear weapon and testing it, its Iran getting a nuclear weapon and not using it. Because the second that they have one and they dont do anything bad, all of the naysayers are going to come back and say, See, we told you Iran is a responsible power. We told you Iran wasnt getting nuclear weapons in order to use them immediately.  And they will eventually define Iran with nuclear weapons as not a problem.Is that clear? Iran using a nuclear weapon would be bad: environmental damage, loss of human life, hideous pain and suffering, yada, yada, yada. But what would be really bad would be Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon and doing what every other nation with them has done since Nagasaki: nothing. That would be really bad because it would damage an argument for war and make war more difficult, thus allowing Iran to run its country as it, rather than the United States, sees fit. Of course it might run it very badly (although the U.S. is hardly establishing a model for the world over here either), but it would run it without U.S. approval, and that would be worse than nuclear destruction.Inspections were allowed in Iraq and they worked. They found no weapons and there were no weapons. Inspections have been allowed in Iran and have worked. However, the IAEA has come under the corrupting influence of the U.S. government. And yet, the bluster from war proponents about IAEA claims over the years is not backed up by any actual claims from the IAEA. And what little material the IAEA has provided for the cause of war has been widely rejected when not being laughed at.Another year, another lie. No longer do we hear that North Korea is helping Iran build nukes. Lies about Iranian backing of Iraqi resisters have faded. (Didnt the United States back French resistance to Germans at one point?) Another recent concoction is the Iran did 911 lie. Revenge, like the rest of these attempted grounds for war, is actually not a legal or moral justification for war. But the 9/11 fiction has already been put to rest by the indespensable Gareth Porter, among others. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, which did play a role in 911 as well as in the Iraqi resistance, is being sold record quantities of that good old leading U.S. export of which were all so proud: weapons of mass destruction.Oh, I almost forgot another lie that hasnt quite entirely faded yet. Iran did not try to blow up a Saudi ambassador in Washington, D.C., an action which President Obama would have considered perfectly praiseworthy if the roles were reversed, but a lie that even Fox News had a hard time stomaching. And thats saying something.And then theres that old standby: Ahmadinejad said Israel should be wiped off the map. While this does not, perhaps, rise to the level of John McCain singing about bombing Iran or Bush and Obama swearing that all options including nuclear attack are on the table, it sounds extremely disturbing: wiped off the map! However, the translation is a bad one. A more accurate translation was the regime occupying Jerusalem must vanish from the page of time. The government of Israel, not the nation of Israel. Not even the government of Israel, but the current regime. Hell, Americans say that about their own regimes all the time, alternating every four to eight years depending on political party (some of us even say it all the time, without immunity for either party). Iran has made clear it would approve of a two-state solution if Palestinians approved of it. If the U.S. launched missile strikes every time somebody said something stupid, even if accurately translated, how safe would it be to live near Newt Gingrichs or Joe Bidens house?Luckily, war resisters have succeeded for so long (even while telling each other that they never succeed) that the war mongers dont remember who Ahmadinejad even was anymore, and all that demonization has gone to nought.The real danger may not actually be the lies. The Iraq experience has built up quite a mental resistance to these sorts of lies in many U.S. residents. The real danger may be the slow start of a war that gains momentum on its own without any formal announcement of its initiation. Israel and the United States have not just been talking tough or crazy. Theyve been murdering Iranians. And they seem to have no shame about it. The day after a Republican presidential primary debate at which candidates declared their desire to kill Iranians, the CIA apparently made certain the news was public that it was in fact already murdering Iranians, not to mention blowing up buildings. Some would say and have said that the war has already begun. Those who cannot see this because they do not want to see it will also miss the deadly humor in the United States asking Iran to return its brave drone.There was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war. The one that interested me the most was why dont we build  we in our shipyard  build four or five boats that look like Iranian PT boats. Put Navy seals on them with a lot of arms. And next time one of our boats goes to the Straits of Hormuz, start a shoot-up. Might cost some lives. And it was rejected because you cant have Americans killing Americans. Thats the kind of  thats the level of stuff were talking about. Provocation. But that was rejected.Now, Dick Cheney is not your typical American. Nobody in the U.S. government is your typical American. Your typical American is struggling, disapproves of the U.S. government, wishes billionaires were taxed, favors green energy and education and jobs over military boondoggles, thinks corporations should be barred from buying elections, and would not be inclined to apologize for getting shot in the face by the Vice President.Back in the 1930s, the Ludlow Amendment nearly made it a Constitutional requirement that the public vote in a referendum before the United States could go to war. President Franklin Roosevelt blocked that proposal. Yet the Constitution already required and still requires that Congress declare war before a war is fought. That has not been done in almost 80 years, while wars have raged on almost incessantly. In the past decade and right up through President Obamas signing of the outrageous National Defense Authorization Act on New Years Eve 2011-2012, the power to make war has been handed over to presidents. Here is one more reason to oppose a presidential war on Iran: once you allow presidents to make wars, you will never stop them. Another reason, in so far as anybody any longer gives a damn, is that war is a crime. Iran and the United States are parties to the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which bans war. One of those two nations is not complying.But we wont have a referendum. The U.S. House of Misrepresentatives wont step in. Only through widespread public pressure and nonviolent action will we intervene in this slow-motion catastrophe. This war, if it happens, will be fought by an institution called the United States Department of Defense, but it will endanger rather than defending us. As the war progresses, we will be told that the Iranian people want to be bombed for their own good, for freedom, for democracy. But nobody wants to be bombed for that. Iran does not want U.S.-style democracy. Even the United States does not want U.S.-style democracy. We will be told that those noble goals are guiding the actions of our brave troops and our brave drones on the battlefield. Yet there will be no battlefield. There will be no front lines. There will be no trenches. There will simply be cities and towns where people live, and where people die. There will be no victory. There will be no progress accomplished through a surge. On January 5, 2012, then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta was asked at a press conference about the failures in Iraq and Afghanistan, and he replied simply that those were successes. That is the kind of success that could be expected in Iran were Iran a destitute and disarmed state.Now we begin to understand the importance of all the media suppression, blackouts, and lies about the damage done to Iraq and Afghanistan. Now we understand why Obama and Panetta embraced the lies that launched the War on Iraq. The same lies must now be revived, as for every war ever fought, for a War on Iran. Heres a video explaining how this will work, even with some new twistsand lots of variations. The U.S. corporate media is part of the war machine.Planning war and funding war creates its own momentum. Sanctions become, as with Iraq, a stepping stone to war. Cutting off diplomacy leaves few options open. Electoral pissing contests take us allwhere most of us did not want to be.These are the bombs most likely to launch this ugly and quite possibly terminal chapter of human history. This animation shows clearly what they would do. For an even better presentation, pair that with this audio of a misinformed caller trying hopelessly to persuade George Galloway that we should attack Iran.On January 2, 2012, the New York Times reported concern that cuts to the U.S. military budget raised doubts as to whether the United States would be prepared for a grinding, lengthy ground war in Asia. At a Pentagon press conference on January 5, 2012, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff reassured the press corpse (sic) that major ground wars were very much an option and that wars of one sort or another were a certainty. President Obamas statement of military policy released at that press conference listed the missions of the U.S. military. First was fighting terrorism, next detering aggression, then projecting power despite anti-access/area denial challenges, then the good old WMDs, then conquering space and cyberspace, then nuclear weapons, and finally  after all that  there was mention of defending the Homeland Formerly Known As The United States.The cases of Iraq and Iran are not identical in every detail, of course. But in both cases we are dealing with concerted efforts to get us into wars, wars based, as all wars are based, on lies. We may need to revive this appeal to U.S. and Israeli forces!Disclaimer: The contents of this article are of sole responsibility of the author(s).

Researchers have exceeded the current record for generating energy from a nuclear fusion reaction. Its a big step toward solving the world power consumption crisis. Nuclear fusion is called the holy grail of energy production  because it could lead to a virtually unlimited source of safe + sustainable power.The nuclear test happened at the worlds most powerful fusion plant  the JET Fusion facility in the UK.The record-breaking nuclear fusion reaction had a temperature of more than 150 million degrees Celsius, 10 times hotter than the heart of the sun. The research team explained that the breakthrough is a landmark for this technology, and a key step toward developing practical nuclear fusion.Most nuclear reactors use fission  thats when big unstable atoms like uranium are split in two, releasing lots of energy + radiation. Fission is the current technique used around the globe in nuclear power plants. But fusion is different. It involves forcing atoms of hydrogen together  fusing them to create: helium, lots of energy, and just a tiny bit of short-lived radiation.Using fusion to create mini-suns inside reactors like this, is one of the greatest tech challenges humanity has ever faced. It holds the potential for producing almost unlimited supplies of energy, forever. The essential part of the test fusion reaction only lasted for 5 seconds  and only generated enough power to boil about 60 kettles of water  11 mega-watts of power. But its an important proof of the science of fusion.The power output was more than double what was achieved in similar tests in year 1997.Temperatures to produce nuclear fusion need to be extremely high  above 100 million Celsius. No materials exist that can withstand direct contact with such heat. So, to achieve fusion in a lab, scientists invented a solution  super-heated gas (called plasma) is held inside a doughnut shaped magnetic field. In geometry this doughnut shape is called a torus. And objects that have a torus shape are called toroidal. The plasma used in the JET Fusion reactor is hotter than anything in our solar system.Future lab tests will make the plasma from a mix of two forms  called isotopes  of hydrogen. These hydrogen isotopes are called deuterium and tritium. The JET Fusion scientists successfully engineered a lining for the 80 cubic meter toroidal shaped vessel enclosing the magnetic field  that functions efficiently with these isotopes.For its experiments in year 1997  the team used carbon. But carbon absorbs tritium, which is radioactive. So for the recent tests, they constructed new walls for the vessel. The walls are made with the metals beryllium and tungsten. These are 10 times less absorbent. Then the JET Fusion team tuned their plasma to function effectively in this new environment.The current test supports the design of an even bigger fusion reactor being constructed in France. The JET Fusion reactor cant actually run any longer because its copper electro-magnets get too hot. New tests will use internally cooled super-conducting magnets. Nuclear fusion reactions in labs famously consume more energy to launch than they can output  this is called an energy deficit. For example, the JET Fusion lab used two 500 mega-watt flywheels just to power the experiment.But scientists believe this deficit can be overcome. New toroidal vessels are being developed  with a volume thats 10 times bigger than JET Fusions vessel. Ultimately the goal is to build a commercial power plant that can produce more energy than it consumes to operate  so the excess energy canbe fed into electric power grids.Theres still much research + development to do. Possible power plants of the future  based on nuclear fusion instead of nuclear fission  would produce no greenhouse gases and only a small amount of short-lived radioactive waste.The JET Fusion facility is located at the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy  managed by the UK Atomic Energy Authority. International nuclear scientists collaborate at the research center as part of the EURO Fusion consortium  made-up of 4,800 experts.The lab was designed to study nuclear fusion in conditions similar to the specs needed for a real power plant. Its the only lab that can operate with the deuterium-tritium fuel mix thats used for commercial fusion energy. This excellent facility achieves major advances in the science + engineering of fusion. Its success led to the construction of the first commercial-scale nuclear fusion machine  and its scientists have proven the design for future fusion power plants.In this photo you can see the towers of a typical nuclear fission facility that produces electricity  called a power plant. Today there are approx. 440 of these nuclear power reactors operating globally  providing approx. 10 percent of the worlds electricity.The hope of recent nuclear fusion tests is to develop practical techniques to harness energy successfully  paving the way for sustainable fusion power plants of tomorrow. Our current world-wide nuclear energy reactors operate using fission.These vintage systems are not as efficient, and produce toxic by-products. If fission power plants overheat, it spells disaster for human health + habitat. They also produce an enormous amount of radioactive waste thats getting more + more difficult to dispose of  since the radiation decays so slowly that it continues to pose biological + environmental risks long after its passed its usefulness in the reactor.This is a stunning result because they managed to demonstrate the greatest amount of energy output from the fusion reactions of any device in history. The test demonstrated stability of the plasma for over 5 seconds.



Its the coldest time of the year, and the demand for energy is significantly higher as people try to warm their homes. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), in Alabama seven out of ten homes rely on electric heating during the winter months. Increasing demand is placing a strain on our power grid, and the Biden administration has no solution to the problem.Instead of providing families with reliable energy, Joe Biden and his administration have other priorities. Theyve spent the last three years on a crusade to make America dependent on unreliable energy sources such as wind and solar power, all in the name of supposedly fighting climate change. While wind and solar have roles to play in domestic energy production, we simply cannot rely on them. The sun doesnt always shine and the wind doesnt always blow, but our energy grid needs to run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.Despite Joe Bidens best efforts, most of our energy still comes from fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas. Democrats dont like to admit this, but when wind and solar power fail, the backup generators are powered by oil and natural gas. Without fossil fuels, our energy grid and our economy could not function.Right now, nuclear energy accounts for approximately 20% of our power grid, which is more than wind and solar combined. The U.S. has the most nuclear power production of any country in the world, but we could be producing even more. Burdensome regulations and bureaucratic red tape from the Biden administration are slowing down nuclear permitting and production from doing even more.Once again, Democrat politicians would rather play politics than do what is best for the working people of this country. They know their left-wing voter base hates nuclear energyand they wont risk offending them.There is neither an economic nor a scientific basis for opposition to nuclear energy, which is the single most efficient source of energy known to man. It is 8,000 times more efficient than fossil fuelswhich are already much more efficient than wind and solar power. This efficiency grants nuclear power an unparalleled ability to bring down the price of energyand, in turn, reduce prices throughout our economy.Nuclear is also safe for the environment. Nuclear energy produces zero emissions and removes harmful pollutants from the atmosphere. Claims that nuclear energy production is dangerous are simply outdated. After the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, there was a panic among Americans, and the federal government canceled President Nixons goal of building 1,000 nuclear reactors. Despite zero deaths from the Three Mile Island incident, our energy policy has never recovered from this mistake and continues declining with the close of 13 American nuclear reactors since 2013.Scientists are always working to learn from the past and improve our technical knowledge. We know a lot more about nuclear safety now than we did in 1979. Our technology is better than ever and continues to improve each day.Alabama understands this better than almost any state as we are proud to be the nations fifth-largest producer of nuclear energy with two nuclear plants and five nuclear reactors. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) operates Browns Ferry in Athens, Alabama, which is their largest nuclear plant and has the second-largest nuclear power generating capacity in the nation. Browns Ferry directly supports 1,500 Alabama jobs and powers more than two million homes.On the other end of the state, just outside of Dothan, Alabama Power runs Plant Farley, generating nearly 20% of Alabama Powers electricity. Plant Farley supports 900 good jobs in the Wiregrass area, and I am grateful to Alabamas energy workers for keeping the lights on for us.America needs to learn from Alabama. We need to stop the obsession with wind and solar energy and do a better job of investing in nuclear energy. The polls show that a clear majority of the public wants more nuclear powerand that majority is growing by the day. Its good economics. Its good energy policy. Its good environmental policy. And its long overdue.
In the past weeks, the Labour Party has dramatically scaled back its 28 billion green investment plans, while the Conservative government has committed to annual licensing rounds in the North Sea in a new oil and gas bill.Wrangling between the Tories and Labour has also opened the door for fringe political activists. Parties such as Reform UK have exploited mixed messaging over climate policy, which the UN authority on climate science, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, says is essential to secure to secure a liveable and sustainable future for all.The campaign has been overshadowed by the sacking of the frontrunner candidate, Azhar Ali, who was dropped by Labour over his controversial comments about the October 7 Hamas attacks. It is too late for Labour to field another candidate, and Ali will now run as an independent.Simon Danczuk, who is standing for Reform UK, and George Galloway, the candidate for the Workers Party of Britain, have both repeatedly attacked the UKs legally binding net zero targets, while Galloway has spread climate misinformation and backed new fossil fuel extraction.This month Danczuk announced he had joined Reform UK. Danczuk was the MP for Rochdale between 2010 and 2017. He is seeking a return to the constituency following his expulsion from the Labour Party in 2015 after sending sexually explicit messages to a 17-year-old (he served as an independent until 2017).Last June he wrote an article attacking the eco-madness of Labours (now scaled back) green investment plans and its pledge not to approve new oil and gas projects. He wrote that Labour see implementing a green ideology as more important than jobs, security and sustaining the economy.The article was published in Spiked, an online libertarian outlet which has a record of climate science denial and fossil fuel-linked funding. Between 2015 and 2018, Spiked received $300,000 from the Charles Koch Foundation, an arm of oil giant Koch Industries and a major funder of climate denial.Danczuk repeated the green ideology argument in an interview with the fringe right-wing outlet Epoch Times, stating: The idea of banning gas and oil exploration in the North Sea, before weve got alternatives in place, is just absolute madness.In September 2023, Danczuk publicly voiced support for the Conservative governments net zero U-turns, telling TalkTV that voters are very despondent about these targets and that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had called it right. TalkTV has its own record of spreading climate denial, and until last year employed Reform leader Richard Tice as a presenter.Reform is campaigning to scrap all of net zero and received 135,000 in donations from climate deniers and fossil fuel interests in 2023. Tice has said CO2 isnt poison, its plant food, while the partys London mayoral candidate Howard Cox has said man is not responsible for global warming.Another ex-Labour Party MP, George Galloway, is standing for the Workers Party of Britain, a party he founded after the 2019 general election. Galloway was expelled from Labour in 2003 for bringing the party into disrepute after a party tribunal found he had incited Arabs to fight British troops and incited British troops to defy orders. He has since been elected to parliament twice  in 2005 for his Respect party and 2012 as an independent  each time serving one term.The party is hostile to climate policies. Its website calls for a much clearer debate on Net Zero and argues that a halt must also be made to the attempt to make working people pay for subsidies for large-scale green industrialisation.Last July the party called for a Brexit-style referendum on net zero, a policy originally pushed by the right-wing Reform UK and led by its honorary president Nigel Farage. (Galloway and Farage have worked together in the past as part of the Aaron Banks-funded Grassroots Out campaign for Brexit.)Galloway has attacked net zero targets, advocated for clean coal extraction and spread misinformation about climate change.In December, Galloway called for a net zero referendum in a post on the social media platform X. On his YouTube talk show in August 2022, Galloway spread the false claim that people would be forced to eat insects to tackle climate change, adding, I think this net zero is one of the biggest hoaxes in modern politics. He then took a swipe at climate activist Greta Thunberg, a regular target for climate deniers, calling net zero a 14-year old schoolgirl leading grown men and women up the garden path.The following month, he again dismissed climate warnings from activists like Thunberg, arguing that the main climate risk came from NATO and the military industrial complex. He said: We are facing climate catastrophe; not man made the likes of Greta Thunberg talks about, but through our own governments.Galloway has also called for more fossil fuel extraction. In an X post in March 2022, a month after Russias full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Galloway wrote: Britain needs to ice its [Net] Zero fantasy, step up its oil exploitation [and] invest in peaceful nuclear energy and seek to re-harvest the 1,000 years of coal under our feet employing clean-coal technology. Our Energy policy is hopelessly unbalanced.From 2008 to 2013, Galloway worked as a presenter for Press TV, the English-language channel run by the Iranian government. From 2013 to 2015 Galloway was paid 100,000 to present a show on RT (Russia Today), Russias equivalent. Both countries are major oil and gas producers. The channels have since had their broadcasting licences revoked by Ofcom for breaking its rules (Galloways broadcasts were not referenced in the ruling).According to a favourable profile in Rochdale Online, Ellison has been active in the local community protecting green spaces, and is credited with winning Rochdale recognition by the Royal Horticultural Society In Bloom awards.He doesnt appear to have commented publicly about Labours weakening of its own net zero plans. Earlier this month, the party dropped its pledge to invest 28 billion per year in green measures, cutting its spending plans by 75 percent to 23.7 billion in total. Labour says it will still keep to its target to decarbonise the UKs power grid by 2030.The party opposes new North Sea exploration, but supports unproven carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology on existing rigs. Earlier this month, Labour leader Keir Starmer said current pipelines would continue for decades.Lib Dem candidate Iain Donaldson has said he wants to hold the government to account on water companies polluting the rivers with filthy sewage, among other issues. In a 2017 tweet he criticised the then U.S. President Donald Trumps withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement.Donaldson was one of eleven of the partys 15 MPs who voted against the Offshore Petroleum Licensing Bill this week, while four abstained. The Liberal Democrats propose moving the net zero target forward five years to 2045 and support large investments in renewable energy.A Liberal Democrat spokesperson said Donaldson had opposed the oil and gas bill, which fails to take vital steps to grow the UK renewable energy sector and reduce energy bills, and fails to form a coherent path to net zero.Iain wants to see the de facto moratorium on onshore wind farms lifted, they added, and allow the expansion of the cheapest form of energy to drive down bills in this cost of living crisis, and reduce our emissions helping to slow climate change.
Former prime minister Scott Morrison said he wants to be like Julia Gillard after politics, the SMH reports, because shes widely respected for her post-PM conduct. Erm, one might say shes widely respected for her leadership achievements  her iconic gender equality speech, Gonski, NDIS, the NBN, and the valiant attempt at a carbon price  as well as her more recent charitable achievements with Beyond Blue, the Wellcome Trust and the Global Partnership for Education, but whatever. Morrison will give his last speech at noon today before his political retirement (and there may be some dancing in the streets this afternoon), saying we should connect with Judeo-Christian values, The Australian ($) says. His parting thoughts: Peter Dutton is doing a fab job as Liberal leader (in December Dutton was voted the countrys least trusted politician) while former (and possibly next) US president Donald Trump poses no threat to our national interest.Meanwhile, Trump was in awe of Russian President Vladimir Putinexactly like a kid is in awe of the heroic football team captain, former PM Malcolm Turnbull recalled from his leadership days to ABCs Q+A. Its downright creepy, Turnbull continued, not to mention a threat to Australias security considering Trump and his Republican allies are sympathetic to Putin and dont care about democracy. The former PM continued Trump could force Ukraine to surrender or pull out of NATO (which he may well do, as CNN says) adding wed be dealing with three autocracies if he wins the November US election (plus China and Russia). Turnbull also described himself as a friend of Israel and said Hamas wanted Israel to kill Gazan civilians. But he posed two rhetorical questions: is the Palestinian death toll (now 29,606) so high that Israels claim to protect human life is bogus, and is Israel losing so much public support that theyre doing what Hamas wanted?Mardi Gras has asked NSW Police not to march in Saturdays parade, ABC reports, after a cop was charged with the alleged murders of a Sydney couple. The board said the community needs space to grieve the loss of the pair, who would have attended the festival. NSW Police said they were disappointed. NSW Premier Chris Minns pointed out that some in the force would have experienced discrimination themselves and that he hoped theyd be able to represent their community as well as NSW Police. It comes as deputy commissioner David Hudson said alleged murderer Beau Lamarre-Condon had been approved to keep his gun away from the police station, the SMH said, though wouldnt say whether it was kept at his home. The force has asked Victorias commissioner to review NSWs gun policies.To another battle for equality and a female miner makes $38,562 less than a male one, new Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA) data reveals. It looked at the pay gap in every company with more than 100 employees (there are 5,000 of them) and found 61.6% paid men more, 30.1% paid both genders almost the same (within 5% anyway) and 8.3% paid women more. So how is it calculated? It lines up mens and womens salaries at a company from lowest to highest and picks out the middle value  the median. So its not measuring men against women doing the same job  thats been the law for over 50 years. Airlines were particularly disparate  Alliance Airlines: 50.2%, Jetstar: 43.7%, Virgin Australia: 41.7%, Cathay Pacific: 39.5% and Qantas: 37%, as Guardian Australia lists. At brewer Lion, maker of XXXX, Tooheys and Four Pillars gin, the median base pay gender gap is just 1.4% the ABC adds.Private Media, parent company of Crikey, was not assessed.Former deputy PM and Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce has a sleeping disorder known as comorbid sleep apnoea and insomnia (COMISA), an expert will tell him on a new show called Australias Sleep Revolution with Dr Michael Mosley. And people with that combo die earlier, the expert will tell him per news.com.au. The result came after they measured his blood pressure both before and after 10 sitting days of Parliament (it goes from high to dangerously high) and monitored his sleep. The three other politicians involved in the program are Senator Jacqui Lambie and Labor MPs Mike Freelander and Josh Wilson. It comes after Joyce bowed to pressure and took leave from Parliament after being filmed having fallen off a plant box in Canberra and swearing into his phone.To a very different type of sickness now and Northern Territory Polices most elite unit had a c**n of the year award for members who exhibited the most c**n-like behaviour, former police officer Zachary Rolfe told the inquest into the death of Indigenous teenager Kumanjayi Walker, who he shot and killed while trying to arrest. Absolutely dismal. The Australian ($) reports the inquest is unearthing the seedy culture of the Top Ends police, including messages and radio transmissions between police officers that used deeply offensive slurs about Indigenous peoples. Rolfe said hed been racist too, but said it was accepted in the NT Police and had rubbed off on him. To something more positive now and women receiving support through an Indigenous-led maternity care model are three times less likely to have their newborns removed by child protection services, The National Indigenous Times reports. We can make great change through holistic services, one expert said.Nur Hidayah Mohamad was in her early twenties when she faced the last goodbye with her father. He had kidney disease and was nearly at the end when he dug into his old wallet and placed the equivalent of a $16 note into her shaky hands. Looking down at the note tearfully, she grabbed a nearby pen and scribbled last money from dad in Malaysian  the words duit last ayah bagi as ABC reports. She tucked the note into her own wallet intending to treasure the priceless memento forever. But some months later, Hidayah realised the note was all the money she had left. She said a silent little prayer that it would return to her one day as she spent the note.Four years later, a person named Azfarul Zainol withdrew some cash from an ATM when he spotted something odd in the wad. Reading the words, Zainol was touched and promptly tucked the note into his wallet in much the same way Hidayah had. It had to mean something to someone, he figured, so he posted a photo to his Facebook wondering about the original owner. Next minute the post had been shared some 12,000 times, and confusingly, he had four separate messages from people claiming to be the writer. One of them was Hidayah, and Zainol could feel the painful truth in her message (though he checked her social media posts to make sure her story checked out anyway). The pair met up soon after and he handed Hidayah the note, the token of her fathers last act of care safe in her hands again.I do know how to do projects. I do know the science. And I do know the economics. These misinformed, unscientific, uneconomic, plucked-out-of-thin-air bulldust of nuclear policies of politicians masquerading as leaders helps no-one.The Fortescue billionaire says only bad things can happen if we believe nuclear energy to be our fairy godmother in the climate change era as Opposition Leader Peter Dutton and Coalition figures spruik.But Keating was not then, and isnt now, an all-knowing oracle, as he is sometimes deified by the press gallery. His boundless confidence empowered him not only to overcome the forces of complacency on much-needed changes but also to blow past legitimate reservations on less noble quests, such as privatisation,enterprise bargainingandan inadequate recession response, which his Labor descendants have since begun undoing.Nines Peter Hartcher worries Keating is only now souring his legacy, but his record was in fact always mixed. This would be a matter for historians, if Keating did not bob up so frequently in public debate, and if his prescriptions had changed with the times. But they havent. He is still pushing the same barrows he was in the 1990s, for better and worse. He is not a prophet; he is a fossil.Only 21 federal politicians out of 277 have not declared any gifts from Qantas. A further two have declared interests in Qantas but no lounge membership. Liberal Senator David Fawcett  who is a lounge member but has chosen not to declare it  reported getting an upgrade from economy to premium economy on a flight from Perth to London last July.The other, Labor Senator Tony Sheldon  a prominent critic of the airline and its leadership under ex-CEO Alan Joyce  bought Qantas shares last September. That was the same month Joyce announced he wouldbring forward his retirement after being grilled in the Senate about Qantas record profits, customer dissatisfaction and alleged anti-competitive behaviour.There are a few reasons for Egypts opposition. The first is that Egypt does not want to be seen to be facilitatingethnic cleansing through the permanent resettlement of Palestinians outside of Gaza. In October,a leaked documentfrom Israels Intelligence Ministry included recommendations to forcibly transfer Gazas population of 2.2 million out of the territory and into tent cities in Egypts Sinai Desert.Government ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir have also both openly advocated the expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza to make way for their replacement by Israeli settlers. Further, in January,a conferencein Israel calling for this very plan wasattended by 11 members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus cabinet and 15 additional members of Parliament.A faultline has opened in Keir Starmers pragmatic politics  and this time none of the usual fixes will work  Nesrine Malik (The Guardian): Its ostensibly successful face-saving amendment to the SNPs ceasefire motion  and its apparent pressure on the speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, to upturn parliamentary convention  brought about a crisis in the Commons, and has done little to appease angry voters. The resulting waves of claim and toxic counterclaim are still building: Lee Andersons outburst of anti-Muslim rhetoric has led to him being stripped of the Tory whip. No matter how much analysis says otherwise, particularly the sort that treats Westminster as a self-contained theatre of political gamesmanship, Labours victory was a pyrrhic one. It was secured in the Commons but lost outside its walls, highlighting an inescapable limitation in the partys very coding.Whatever motion Labour ended up ramming through, it came too late. The partys first position on Gaza, refusing to condemn breaches of international law (or even call them that), and refusing to call for a ceasefire, has made too strong an impression for it to be erased by any new modifications. It was a position that fed into something bigger: into pre-existing reservations and dwindling faith in the party. For those the party was trying to bring round, the manner in which it prevailed will only act to reinforce its most suspect qualities  calculating, pedantic, authoritarian. Ready to drag Parliament into the mire so it could pursue its manic drive to keep control of a party narrative that now exists only in the leaderships heads.Families once fled my struggletown suburb. Then the gentrifiers arrived  Claire Heaney (The Age): Richmond feels like a big country town as you spot familiar faces at the bowlo, walking to the G to barrack for the Tiges or shopping at the Gleadell Street Market each Saturday. When there is a big game at the MCG, the suburb comes alive. Living in Richmond when the Tigers won the 2017 and 2019 premierships is up there in my all-time favourite moments. Two of my children went to schools beyond their home suburb and in the early years said they wished they lived out in the greener parts of Melbourne, where their friends had swimming pools and huge rumpus rooms to host sleepovers and parties  Theres no way I could afford to buy here now. Richmonds median house price is $1,377,500 and the unit price $590,000. I fear young families may be missing out on the experience of raising a family in Richmond.Its beginning to feel like there are more fur babies than the human variety. While people shift out once kids arrive or feel that they have outgrown the suburb, there can be huge benefits in staying. Kids can walk to school, to sport training or part-time jobs, encouraging their independence and helping us avoid many hours stuck in traffic. Richmond continues to evolve as we enter a new cycle where many of our older friends give up the inner-city lifestyle and move out. The thought of leaving has crossed my mind, but the convenience of being so close to the city, medical services, shopping, recreation, trams and trains and varied food offerings makes it as hard to give up, as are the friendships forged over decades.Emma Elsworthy is Climate Editor at Crikey, SmartCompany, and The Mandarin, and writes daily morning newsletter the Worm.

Our fourth quarter conference calls always provide a great opportunity to discuss the past year's developments in the uranium and nuclear fuel markets. It's also a good time to touch on a few annual highlights that demonstrate how well our strategy is performing and to provide some insights into our current expectations for the year ahead. So that's the outline I'll follow today. This past year, we've been consistently talking about the positive market momentum, so I think I can be fairly brief on that side of things. We spent a great deal of time on our calls, in our presentations, and on our webcasts talking about our optimism and positive view of the constructive market conditions we've seen throughout 2023. And we are absolutely maintaining that enthusiasm moving into 2024. Those listening today that tuned in for a few of our calls and presentations prior to 2020, would be very familiar with the phrase positive long-term fundamentals. I say somewhat tongue-in-cheek that we use that message more than just a few times to reinforce our optimism through the lowest points of the market cycle. Back when we initially made that statement, we certainly couldn't forecast the timing of a market transition. But we remained convinced that once the excess uncommitted primary supply and mobile inventories cleared the market, and as demand continued to grow, our industry would recover and our company, would be stronger than ever. So now, as we watch the uranium contracting cycle shift closer to a replacement rate level, I can say with confidence that we have entered the early part of that long-term window, we'd been talking about. And those fundamentals we were referring to, they are even more positive than we had anticipated. On the demand side, we used the term durable at every opportunity as we believe it accurately describes and effectively differentiates today's fundamental demand picture from previous cycles. The previous peaks in our market have typically lasted for weeks, while the valleys have lasted for years. That was the case when the excitement about uranium and nuclear was driven by one or two discrete events. A mine shaft failure, the end of the megatons to megawatts program, a flooded mine in development, Chinese contracting that absorbed significant supply. Those types of events all added speculative, shorter-term, momentary pressure to supply and demand. However, in today's environment, the uranium market is certainly having more than just a moment. Instead, we're seeing full-cycle growth in the near, mid, and long-term with broad interest in nuclear energy like never before. And it's being driven by global scale factors that are widely expected to persist for years to come. Geopolitical tension is prompting governments all over the world, to reevaluate energy security and enact policies to reduce risk and eliminate reliance on unstable jurisdictions. And as they do so, climate change and electron accountability remain top of mind, which truly puts nuclear in the spotlight. There's a growing consensus that there is, no net zero without nuclear, and 28 countries have now signed on to an international declaration that calls for a tripling of nuclear energy capacity by 2050. The EU, U.S., U.K., Canada, France, and Japan, are just some of the jurisdictions, where bipartisan support is translating to political action, with a few already introducing financial incentives to back nuclear development. As a result of this support, we are seeing life extensions, reactor refurbishments, and a call for new builds to provide secure, reliable, and clean base load power. And we have a technological evolution on the horizon as well, with SMRs and advanced reactors extending the use case for nuclear, beyond just electricity, further strengthening the outlook for growing demand. So demand is durable, and growing with more support than ever. So how does that stack up, against the supply side fundamentals? Well, that's where significant uncertainty remains. The geopolitical tensions that are pushing the reevaluation of energy security are also adding negative pressure to supply, resulting impact on mining activity, fuel cycle services, supply chains, and global transportation continues to create significant challenges. Last week we saw a tangible impact on supply, resulting from those challenges when our Kazakh 2.16 partner, Kazatomprom (LON:KAPq), revised their expected 2024 production volumes down in response to limited access to acid and development delays. We're now working with Kazatomprom to determine the impact on our share of 2024 production from JV Inkai. Supply chain challenges combined with ongoing mine depletion, declining and finite secondary supplies, and a decade of underinvestment in exploration and mine capacity amid low market prices has led to what is a very tight market today, something that is expected to persist into the next decade. So considering both demand and supply, I think we can safely reiterate that strong long-term fundamentals is still a message that continues to resonate, creating the full cycle growth, we've been talking about. Looking back at the very difficult supply discipline decisions, we had to make and the strategy we put in place in the context of that persistent, positive long-term view. I can now say it was all to prepare us for today's market, and for the second half of this decade and beyond. We at Cameco have maintained a disciplined approach to managing the financial, contracting and operational facets of our strategy during those tough times. We did what we said we're going to do, which positioned us well to capture full cycle demand with a supply pipeline that was only going to respond to real end-user demand as it evolved. And considering customer fuel requirements into the future, we knew that the focus had to return to the long-term market, because as always, the total volume of requirements, is far greater than what is available in the near-term spot market. It evolved quickly just as we predicted it would, and our patients and our experience are paying off with positive results. We saw a significant improvement in our financial performance metrics in 2023, thanks to higher sales volumes and higher realized prices in our uranium and fuel services segments. This drove improved net earnings, adjusted net earnings and cash from operations, which all more than doubled in 2023, compared to the year before, and with a significant increase in adjusted EBITDA. And our continued discipline and our tried and tested long-term contracting strategy, helped to mitigate risks related to our capital decisions and mining plans. Our strategy is designed to allow us to align production decisions, with our customer needs and the commitments in our contract portfolio and ensures we don't add excess supply and capacity when there's no demand in the market. We understand that to generate full cycle value, we can't be mining on spec. We must build a home for our pounds years ahead of time before we pull them out of the ground in order to avoid having to sell material into a thinly traded and discretionary spot market. That means in today's contracting cycle, we can link the pounds that we previously left in the ground to the long-term contractual commitments that are being negotiated today. And those contracts are being executed in the context of a significantly improved market environment, generating value for Cameco as we deliver into them now and in the years to come. We ended 2023 with a healthy contract book and total long-term commitments of 205 million pounds of uranium with 37 customers worldwide. That total commitment level of over 200 million pounds only represents about 20% of our current reserve, and resource base, providing us with plenty of exposure, to improving demand from our customers, as they look to secure their long-term needs. To deliver on those commitments, we must continue to plan for the sourcing of the uranium we need well ahead of time. In the near and mid-term, we always start with our expected production from MacArthur River, Key Lake, Cigar Lake, and Inkai. We can then draw material from our inventory and with the licensed storage facilities that we operate, we have secured the ability to borrow product under the terms of some of our storage agreements. Additionally, we have the ability to pull forward long-term purchase arrangements that, we put in place in a much lower price environment. Our marketing team can also source material, from market purchases. While those purchases would be more expensive than, our production and other available supply, our strategy and long-term portfolio positions us to benefit when there is increased near-term demand, for scarce nuclear fuel supplies and services. However, when it comes to sourcing for the longer term, based on our existing contract portfolio and the contracting momentum that is building in the market, we do expect to need more than our current annual production volumes. That includes the more than 130 million Tier 1 pounds that we've left in the ground, when we shifted into supply discipline from 2016 to 2022. As a major producer, we don't often discuss our pipeline of reserves and resources. But when we consider that pipeline in the context of the more than 200 million pounds we've committed under long-term contracts that, include escalated prices and escalated floors and ceilings, we have an exposure rate of about 80%. That means we have about 800 million pounds of current in-ground inventory that is not contracted or priced, representing future potential value. That's part of a very deliberate strategy. As a proven and diversified producer, Cameco is well positioned to add long-term value. And, since we are always adding to a contract portfolio that provides upside participation and downside protection, we expect development of future production from that in-ground inventory will be funded by the cash flow from product sales, not from dilutive equity raises, or significant debt leverage. Thanks to our discipline and our improving financial performance, we consider the next steps in our strategy and start to invest in our Tier 1 capacity. We now have an updated Cigar Lake technical report that we expect to release sometime in March, which includes the conversion of over 40 million pounds of our share of indicated resources to probable reserves, extending mine life at Cigar to 2036. And, we're undertaking a study to evaluate the work, timelines and investment required to expand the MacArthur River mine and the Key Lake Mill from 18 million pounds of annual production today, up to the licensed capacity of 25 million pounds, our share being 70%. If we took advantage of all Tier 1 growth opportunities, our annual share of Tier 1 uranium supply, could be about 32 million pounds. But, beyond our Tier 1 assets, we also continue to assess the future need and economic potential of our fully licensed and permitted Tier 2 assets. Those assets remain on care and maintenance today, but they provide another layer of optionality when it comes to sourcing material for long-term commitments. And remember that unlike a declared or untested asset owned by a developer making promises, our Tier 2 assets are demonstrated assets with an operational history and known costs, and they're in the hands of a proven producer, putting them in a much lower risk category. As one of the world's largest producers, we don't realize any benefit from the voluntary public disclosure of our advanced project work at Millennium, [Yaleri] and Kintyre or from our ongoing exploration successes. But there too, we continue to make progress and evaluate future prospects that align with market demand and our long-term contract sourcing requirements. We've provided a bit more background on our exploration framework in our MD&A this year, because it's not widely known that we have discovered numerous Greenfield prospects and deposits over the years. And those discoveries are underlying the very attractive land position on the most prospective trends, all right in our backyard of Northern Saskatchewan, where we have well-established industrial and mine support infrastructure, and where our exploration activities continue. Beyond uranium mining, our contracting success and financial strength is also allowing us to grow and enhance the value of our fuel cycle assets and other investments. Similar to our mining assets, we won't increase fuel services production or capacity until we see customer commitments. Thanks to that disciplined approach, we have the capacity to grow at a time when customers are avoiding Russian supplies and services, and the market has identified a significant need in the conversion and enrichment stages of the fuel cycle. To meet those growing commitments in our Fuel Services segment, we are increasing our 2024 UF6 production at Port Hope to 12,000 tonnes, which would represent a record production level for the facility, exceeding the record production levels we set in both 2022 and again in 2023. We've now contracted 75,000 tonnes of UF6 conversion with 33 customers worldwide, which we expect to underpin the operation of our Port Hope conversion facility for years to come. We also have a 49% interest in global laser enrichment, which holds the exclusive license to deploy a third-generation uranium enrichment technology. Subject to its continued progress towards commercialization, if successful, GLE could have the ability to help meet the evolving enrichment needs of the industry, from re-enriching depleted uranium tails to producing commercial low-enriched uranium, for the global reactor fleet in operation today. To delivery of high-assay, low-enriched uranium for the SMRs and advanced reactors of tomorrow, GLE represents a significant opportunity for Cameco, to participate in every stage of the fuel cycle. We're also excited to have added a 49% share of Westinghouse to our portfolio of investments in 2023. Westinghouse is a well-established and critical business to the nuclear power industry, which gives us more exposure to the light water side of the nuclear fuel cycle, while adding potential growth opportunities related, to their conventional and advanced reactor sales. We expect our share of adjusted EBITDA from Westinghouse in 2024, to be between $445 million and $510 million. And we believe the business is well-positioned for long-term growth, driven by the expected increase in global demand for nuclear power. Over the next five years, we expect Westinghouse's adjusted EBITDA, to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 6% to 10%. But even with the significant acquisition in Westinghouse, we have maintained the capacity for further investments, should value-adding opportunities emerge. Our balance sheet remains strong, with $567 million in cash, approximately $1.8 billion in total debt, and a $1 billion undrawn credit facility. In our Uranium segment, we expect this past year's strong financial performance to continue in 2024. We will continue to transition to our Tier 1 cost structure, and deploy the capital and other expenditures we believe are necessary, to meet our commitments and position the company for continued, sustainable growth. Growth that will be pursued in the same manner that, we approach all aspects of our business - strategic, deliberate, disciplined, and with a focus on generating full-cycle value. And with a continued focus on the environmental, social, and governance side of our business as well, where we are very proud of our track record. We integrate ESG principles and practices into every aspect of our business, from our corporate objectives and our approach to compensation to our overall corporate strategy, risk management, and day-to-day operations. As part of our low-carbon transition plan, we created tailored decarbonization pathways in 2023, for each site we operate to support the achievement of our 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. We also completed an analysis of climate change scenarios at our Northern Saskatchewan and Ontario operations, to better understand how changing climate conditions could impact our employees and our assets in the long-term. I encourage you to read through our annual MD&A where we go beyond just performance highlights. In it, you will see a much more detailed picture of our strategy, how we operate, and importantly, insight into the uranium and nuclear fuel market, a market that is unlike any other. So thank you for your interest today and we would be happy to take any questions.Ralph Profiti: Good morning, Cameco team. Thanks for taking my questions. Tim, in the evaluation of MacArthur River up to 25 million pounds, when will this work be completed? Assuming things being taken into consideration include issues from September 2023, including your supply chains, skilled labor, as well as some of the special technical considerations. Do you see a potential scenario where Tier 2, whether it be U.S. ISR or Rabbit Lake, may be more desirable than MacArthur River production? Because those production centers may not be as constrained.Tim Gitzel: Yes, morning Ralph. Thanks. Nice to hear from you. We are just starting the MacArthur Key evaluation work now. We are seeing a market that we think might need those pounds going forward. Those are probably the best pounds on the planet that are not in production yet. So, we are starting our work on what we need to do to de-bottleneck at the Key Lake Mill. The mine is running well today and we know it can produce at that level. So, we are starting the work. Obviously, we are not going to produce on spec. Grant has said that a 100 times. We produce in the contracts that we have. So, we will get that work going and like I say, we are going after that before we go after any Tier 2, I think, project that we still have in care and maintenance. But don't rule those out either, Ralph, because those are on our batting lineup further down the list. But first, as we said in our quarter here, we are going to look at de-bottlenecking MacArthur and Key. So, we can get those to '25 and then that extension, don't underweight that extension of Cigar Lake to 2036. That is a huge move and it really sets us up well for the future.Ralph Profiti: Okay. Understood. Yes, thanks for that color. I also noticed in the uranium sensitivity table that the leverage to 5% change in uranium to revenue is quite low this year. I am just wondering what is going on with the contract book versus the realized price guidance and why we are seeing that sort of diminished leverage versus previous years. And it seems like this is a function of the contract books, maybe perhaps hitting more of those ceilings, or perhaps even up flexing on the part of customer discretion?Grant Isaac: Yes, I think - it is a great question, Ralph. And let us be really clear that we set a strategy that supports short-term price discovery in order to create long-term value. And what I mean by that, is it is categorically the wrong way to think about a uranium producer, as saving production for the spot market in order, to maximize near-term leverage, to the spot market. And the reason for that, we said over and over again, and people really need to understand this, the spot market is small, it is discretionary, it is non-fundamental, and it is low-quality demand. If Cameco produced and showed up and tried, to sell pounds into the spot market, it would not be discovering higher prices. The opposite would happen. The market would realize that we would be showing up with uncommitted primary production and the market would back up. And do not take my word for it. Look at what happened in the days when Paladin, for example, was a spot market seller or Kazatomprom was a spot market seller. That strategy has been proven to be a colossal failure over and over again. So what matters is the non-discretionary, fundamental, high-quality demand of the term market. But make no mistake, Ralph, we do not miss these market moves. We just capture them and build them into the forward contract book. You have heard me say over and over again, we prefer market-related contracts right now. A move like this in the spot market, which we do not sell into, because we do not want to undermine that move in the spot market, allows us to then price market-related contracts forward on a much more attractive basis than we did before the spot market move. And I will just give you an example. When Uranium pushed over $100 per pound, Cameco does not immediately go, how do we sell into the spot market? We go, how do we translate that kind of spot market quick move into forward value? So a market-related contract that we would write today and give to a utility probably has a floor tucked right up at today's long-term price, escalated, and probably has a ceiling in the 120s, escalated. That is how we capture the value of a spot market move. Those who want to play the spot market show up with uncommitted primary production. They put pressure on it, in a thinly traded market it goes down, and they ride it back down. What we do is, we take those moves we build it into the contract portfolio going forward. It's a strategy that sustains near-term price discovery and helps bring that long-term price back up to a sustainable production economic level. So with all that context, no surprise, contracts that we entered into a number of years ago, where if they were at a $70 ceiling a few years ago, would have been a really attractive ceiling. We might be hitting those ceilings in a market-related today. For example, or if there was some base escalated portion. It is good news that this is occurring. It means the market is going into a security of supply contracting cycle. It means our supply discipline strategy is working. It means the forward value capture is growing. And then, of course, I want to reference the comment Tim made, which, folks, 20% of our portfolio of reserves and resources is contracted. 80% is not. That's 800 million pounds of uranium to be priced in a much better environment now. So, we never miss these moves. We build these moves into long-term contracts, long-term cash flow and earnings. That's what's happening.Andrew Wong: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you just talk about your confidence level on production returning to nameplate in 2024 and just some of the longer-term projects for Cigar and MacArthur? I think previously the messaging was that, those projects may not be looked at until the volumes start getting contracted and the demand was there. So now that work is starting on those projects, does that mean that those volumes are starting to get some contracting activity?Tim Gitzel: Thanks, Andrew, for the question. Yes, so just how confident are we on production for this year? We put out 18 million pound forecast for each of those sites, and we're very confident that we'll make that. We have got some more operating experience at MacArthur and Key every month that goes by. It gives us another view on how it's going, and I'd say the last two months have been very good. I'm looking at Brian Reilly, our production has been very good, very steady. We're working out some of the bottlenecks or kinks that you have with a restart. So, we're really happy with the way things are going there. Same at Cigar. You know, well-established mine. We've been operating there for years. We moved into that new war zone. We're getting that under control. The mill had some hiccups, and they've got that under control. So yes, we're very confident in our forecast for 2024. And going forward, yes, as I said earlier, we won't produce on spec, but we will get those assets ready to go at MacArthur Key, and once Grant and his team have contracts in front of us that call for that production, we will move those forward. We'll move the production up at MacArthur Key. And so, there's a timing thing and things don't just happen overnight. We want to be ready when that happens, and the contracts we sign, those long-term contracts that Grant was referencing earlier, they don't start deliveries for a number of years. So we've got time to get things ready. We've got dry powder, and when the time comes, we'll be ready to go. So, we really like our positioning.Andrew Wong: Okay. Great. And maybe for Grant, the contracting strategy makes a lot of sense. Could you maybe just talk about how the contract book and price sensitivity table would look like, beyond the years that are in that table, maybe into like the late 2020s and early 2030s, where you might get more of that leverage, to the rising price environment that we're seeing today?Tim Gitzel: Yes, absolutely designed for leverage to that rising price environment. I mean, really important to emphasize, we are still in supply discipline. We are not calling the top of the market. This is not peak demand going on in uranium yet. We're in the early stages of this contracting cycle, early stages that suggests it's the right strategy, to be very disciplined with our supply. We're thinking about moving the Tier 1 to full capacity like Tim talked about, but we haven't made that decision yet with respect to MacArthur Key, and we haven't even started talking about the Tier 2s. And if we put that altogether and said, what would our annual capability be, that's about 38 million pounds of annual production. And you see in our guidance table, 22.4. So Cameco is not calling peak demand here, or peak price discovery in the uranium business. We're still in supply discipline. We're still in supply discipline, because we think when we look at the uncovered requirements wedge, a lot of demand, non-discretionary fundamental demand needs to come to the market. We want to be exposed to that. So it isn't about selling out the volumes. It's about placing volumes under terms and conditions that make sense to us today. So that is that market related exposure that I talked about. That is really dramatically improving floors and ceilings that are both escalated by the way. And of course, a long-term price that's now $72 U.S. per pound. And that itself is base escalated if you agree to any of those contracts. So as you see going forward, we would look to move beyond that contract table, which only accounts for about 20% of our volume. In fact, that committed sales table is less than that. It's only about 13% of our volumes, because it's just the next five years. So we have 80% of those volumes that aren't yet sold yet. It's a good thing. Prices are going up. We want that exposure to future prices. And when you think about our reserves and resources that aren't yet priced, that have that pure exposure to the uranium price, those are reserves and resources that are in the hands of a proven producer. And many of those reserves and resources are adjacent to existing infrastructure, and you can take advantage of all those incumbencies. So this is exactly where a responsible uranium producer wants to be. Should be in a market that is entering a security of supply contracting cycle. So absolutely, we love our position. We love that exposure going forward. It would be foolish to say, well, we should just be trying to jam all of our material through $103 spot market, because the spot market wouldn't be $103 if we tried to do that. That would be a really silly strategy. So that exposure going forward, nobody has a better position than we do.Orest Wowkodaw: Hi, good morning. A couple of questions on my end, if I could. First of all, can you give us an idea of what kind of capital was required to bring MacArthur up to $25 and to extend Cigar?Brian Reilly: Yes, sure. Great question. Certainly Cigar Lake extension. We are well advanced. We completed a pre-feasibility study that verified the economic feasibility of the extension. We've converted resources to reserve, so we're well down the track there. We'll produce a technical report next month, as Tim mentioned, with all the details. But what we have now in terms of our share for capital at Cigar Lake extension, somewhere in the $250 million, $300 million range, to extend it up to 2036. So Cigar Lake extension is in good shape, and we'll produce a technical report with all the details. MacArthur Key Expansion, early days, very early days. As Tim mentioned, we've just commenced the assessment in terms of what's required at the mine and an end-to-end study at the mill. So, I would suggest just hang in there. We'll be better positioned later in the year, but still early days for MacArthur Key Expansion.Orest Wowkodaw: Perfect. And then a quick question for Grant, if I could. Just on the committed purchases, I guess you've got 4.7 million pounds committed to acquire this year. Can you give us any kind of idea of how the pricing mechanism works on those contracts? Like does it move with market pricing? Is it fixed? How should we think about that?Grant Isaac: Yes, thanks, Orest. So on Page 51 of the MD&A for folks that are looking, we do have a bit of new disclosure actually on our purchase commitments. In previous markets where the spot was oversupplied and we were in extreme supply discipline. And wanted to be heavily over-contracted. We would put a big purchase number out there, because we wanted the market to know that demand was coming and start cleaning up the front end of the market and discovering better prices. But as we're at this phase of our transition, restoring our Tier 1 cost, bringing production back, we wanted to bring a bit more granularity, between what purchases are we already committed to make, and which ones might we go into the market to buy. And what you see when we cut it that way, is very small exposure to the market. We said up to two million pounds that we might buy in the market, but we might. We don't have to. We have other options in order to source our committed sales. Some of those other options include purchases that we make under a long-term purchase commitment. And I think that's what you're referring to. Generally what happens in those long-term purchase commitments is we'll see a market where we might think the uranium price is low. And when we do, we might find a seller who's willing to fix a price for us, subject to a carry trade for delivery out into the future. But for many of those contracts, we have the ability to take delivery when it makes sense for us. So, we fix the price in a lower pricing environment. We take the delivery when it makes sense to meet our committed sales volumes. It's the best trading margin in the business. So many of those long-term contracting, long-term purchase commitments were made in that $30 uranium market. They've escalated a bit, some of them in more recent years, but well, well short of today's market prices. So this is just part of how we think about sourcing material over the long run. So very small market exposure to be deployed if we want to. And then subject to the purchases that come in from Inkai, the purchases that come in from the long-term purchase program. The final thing on Inkai is always remember, we're never afraid of rising uranium prices. And Inkai is a perfect example. Yes, we'll buy the material from Inkai at a discount to the spot price. Those will be very expensive. But if those are expensive, then the dividend that comes back from Inkai is even bigger. So the economic value of those Tier 1 assets is always ours. And we don't fear when prices go up. We don't miss these markets. We capture that value on the long-term. So very attractive source of supply that really reduces our need to go into the market to purchase. But if we see the opportunity to purchase, we'll stick our nose in there. So if somebody decides they want to try to sell material to the spot market, we might be a buyer.Tim Gitzel: Yes, that's right. We saw that some folks were completely misreading our outlook table in the past. They were taking the overall purchases and they were assuming every one of those was going to be made in the spot market and trying to drive an incorrect narrative about financial distress. And of course, we've never run the company that way. If that were the case, the outlook table would be very different. So, we wanted to put some granularity out there, to lots of sophisticated folks understand what we do, but some don't. And so, we just wanted to make sure we had that granularity and remind folks that actually it's up to two million pounds. We could source it directly in the spot market for immediate delivery. We could draw down our inventory. We could access loans. We could access more of the long term purchases if that made sense for us. We could be engaged in a conversation with a customer to move deliveries around in a year for when production comes in. Ultimately, this is what a responsible uranium producer does.Greg Barnes: Yes. Thank you. Just a couple of questions for me and returning back to Cigar Lake extension. Would that be at the 18 million pound per year range or would it decline into 2036? And is there an extension beyond 2036?Tim Gitzel: Greg, thanks for the question. Our plan would be to remain at 18 million pounds per year to 2036. Is there an extension? We're just working on this one right now. So once we get under there, and you know, we're moving to the west on that. And so as we get out there, who knows? We'll be poking holes and holes all over down there. So, we're hopeful, but we don't have anything to report yet, Greg.Greg Barnes: Okay. Just on the Westinghouse guidance for CAGR of 6% to 10% a year. Does that only include in terms of the AP1000 sales, the ones that have been under contract or under contract currently? Or do you make a forecast of potential AP1000 sales that build into that number as well?Tim Gitzel: Yes, Greg, here's the good news. It's just the ones that you know about, the ones that Westinghouse has announced. So more upside to come as they, we believe, might have a huge opportunity in other markets that, are evaluating that stable, proven AP1000 technology. But this is just capturing, the beginnings of the contracts required, to advance AP1000s in the markets that have already announced it.Grant Isaac: Well, lots of interest remains in the conversion plant at Springfields for the natural conversion line. But Springfields is also a critical infrastructure, for a lot of other ambitions as well. We're continuing to work through that process. Obviously, very attractive conversion prices right now in the market that, put some wind in the sails for a restart. But it's got to be done responsibly. It's no different than the uranium market. You don't start a conversion plant, and then start knocking on people's doors and asking if they want to buy a conversion service, because you're just going to push the conversion price down. You have to do this responsibly and in a disciplined way. And we're just working through that process now.Lawson Winder: Thank you very much, operator. And good morning, Cameco team. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about Westinghouse. And it's fantastic to have the detailed disclosure in the notes. The G&A effectively, the marketing administration and general expense is a little bit of a larger number than I thought. Would you be able to provide any detail on what goes into that, or what are some of the large numbers maybe in that or how that breaks down? And then any guidance for that going forward as well? Thank you.Grant Isaac: Yes. There are elements of the Westinghouse business that are pretty high touch. When we think about the core of the business, which we define as nuclear fuel and operating plant systems, as well as the new build, there are a lot of offices, a lot of engagement and a pretty high touch that goes on advancing those kind of contracts. And so, right now when they're at the stage of developing new markets like they are for VVER fuel or developing new markets like expanding into BWR fuel or examining LEU+ fuel. And even the question that Greg asked earlier about Springfields, you know, this is all captured in increased activity running through that line. And of course, the support required to advance new builds, whether that's AP1000s, AP300s or eVinci. So, a bit of a higher touch business than what Cameco is accustomed to, but totally appropriate given the position that Westinghouse is in and their ability to capture the tailwinds in the nuclear industry as well.Heidi Shockey: Yes, it's Heidi here. I would say that they're a pretty stable business. And maybe I would just add to what Grant said in terms of the other pieces that that's really recognizing the fixed costs. Like that is all the costs that, aren't directly related to operations. So, it's maybe broader than just kind of G&A.Lawson Winder: Thank you very much. Now for my follow-up question, I had actually wanted to ask about the conversion market as well. And Grant, you had expressed some review in the investor call in December during the Investor Day that perhaps prices were sort of getting near a top. But I mean, prices have continued to rise since then. I mean, have you changed your view at all? Do you think prices can continue to rise higher, or are in fact we getting to a level where prices are sort of as high as they might go?Grant Isaac: Yes, well, my comment earlier, Lawson, about Cameco's not calling peak demand, or peak pricing, I was referring to uranium, but perhaps in conversion as well. I mean, this market has not really reckoned yet with a couple of big risks. And one of them is obviously the risk that not only does the legislative efforts to restrict Russian supplies in Western markets, become codified into law, but the risk that there's a Russian retaliation. That would be a very constructive environment for conversion, because remember that Russian enrichment service shows up attached to something. It shows up in a cylinder that already has the uranium, already has the conversion. So that will continue to add pressure, to the conversion side of the business. And then, of course, this market, I don't think really appreciates at how difficult restarting production can be, whether it's a uranium asset, whether it's a conversion asset. I think a lot of folks are just assuming these things are easy and they build in a perfection scenario. So between those two really big risks that, there's a ban on Russian material that the Russians actually react to by saying, okay, well, you can't have it today, as well as the reality that's going to set in, that all these big promises about new supply, whether it's on the uranium side or the conversion side, are just going to take longer. That's further price formation in the industry that needs to come. It's why we don't want to call a top. It's why we don't want to rush and secure all the contracts for conversion that would sell out Port Hope or encourage Westinghouse to do that for Springfield. There's more to come to this market. We've seen this story before. Now's the time to remain patient and let that price discovery unfold.Alexander Pearce: Great. Thank you. Good morning all. So I just wondered if you could build on some of the market commentary you've made and in particular just the changes that you've seen so far this year and particularly what's changed in terms of your discussions with utilities since you updated them because that's been from last week.Grant Isaac: Yes, we've seen a market that has behaved exactly like we told you it was going to, Alex. When the market begins to enter a security of supply cycle, actually the importance of the spot market goes down and the importance of the term market goes up. And look at the data. The spot market was smaller in 2023 than it was in 2022. So utilities focus less on the spot market. They focus more on the term market. Goes back to my earlier point about why we don't try to sell stuff into the spot market. It's thinly traded. It's non-fundamental discretionary demand. So as utilities are shifting over, we're seeing a market that hit about 160 million pounds of term contracting. It might be easy to conclude we're at replacement rate, Alex, but I would just say we're not quite there yet because there were two very, very big contracts that went through the market. One that Cameco had with Ukraine and one that Kazatomprom had with the Chinese. If you back those out and ask on a distributed basis across all markets, are we at replacement rate? The answer is no. And so the good news is we're in the early innings of a security of supply contracting cycle. We haven't yet hit a distributed replacement rate and we've never been at this stage of the cycle at these prices before, which is why we want to continue to have that exposure going forward. But some of the common characteristics, tenors continue to go up. Utilities coming to the market for security of supply are looking for requirements covered on a longer term basis. Tenors are going out. Volumes are going up, not just because more years are being added, but because utilities are taking a bigger bite out of each of their requirements contracts. And then, of course, time frames are going out. There are utilities who, Alex, are really well covered for the rest of this decade. They're now worried about the next decade and they're starting to look to contract into that window as well. So all of that very constructive for a view that the long term demand is building, not peaking, but building. And that what we want to remain is very disciplined to capture as much of that price discovery as we can.Alexander Pearce: Great. Thanks, Grant. And then, Tim, you mentioned in your comments the ability to bring forward some of those purchase agreements if required. Are you able to quantify if indeed that did happen for this year for guidance and how much you've brought forward from future years into this year in these purchases?Grant Isaac: It's Grant again. Our plan in the outlook table was the plan all along on that 4.7 million. So we have that as an option to exercise more of those long term purchase requirements if we want. It's why the disclosure on market purchase is up to 2 million pounds. That would be one of the levers why it's not a hard 2 million pounds because we may not buy it in the spot market. We don't have to, but if it makes sense for us, we will.Brian MacArthur: Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. It goes back to the last question. So in this table, and I appreciate now you've given the breakout, two things. Do you assume that you get your Inkai purchases every year? Because again, you also stated right now we're not sure what we're going to get. Again, those are, as you said, profitable pounds once you do the equity component. If not, how do you balance for that? Because again, the question is you could be getting 4 to 5 million profitable pounds from Inkai. And my third question on that is I can't remember, are you getting 50% or 40% of the joint venture now under that agreement? Thanks.Grant Isaac: Brian, let's just start with yes, the table assumes that the volumes expected from Inkai in 2024 arrive. But of course, as we saw in 2023, there can be sometimes timing differences. We got about two-thirds of Inkai's 2023 volumes in 2023, the remainder early 2024. This is something we can deal with as Cameco because we have other sources of supply. We have other mines. We have our inventory. We have all of the levers we've already been talking about. This is actually a much, much bigger problem for the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle because it's close to 50% of the global production of uranium that isn't arriving when it needs to arrive at Western markets. So for Cameco, it's something we can plan for, something we can deal with. We eventually get those pounds and we can deal with the time issue associated with them. The overarching assumption is yes, we're going to receive them. If we don't, we'll manage.Tim Gitzel: Grant, I'd just add to that that the sharing is 60-40 once you reach the nameplate capacity of 4,000 tonnes per year, which is just over 10 million pounds. We've never hit that peak yet. Over the last number of years, we've basically received as a share of production what we would get at 40% of 10 million, so around 3.2 million pound.Brian MacArthur: Great. Thanks. Just so I can be really clear, you also, as you mentioned, got last year's shipments from Inkai. You presumably have those pounds in inventory and the other ones in the Canadian port. So would you not feel pretty comfortable that you're going to have a lot of Inkai pounds to sell this year because they've already arrived and that's embedded in those numbers?Grant Isaac: Yes. Sorry. I hope my comments weren't viewed as being unconfident. We're very confident that that supply is going to show up. And if there are timing challenges, we deal with it within our inventory, within our other sources of supply. So extreme confidence.Brian MacArthur: Okay. Thank you very much. And one quick last question. CRA, I don't want to go back to this at all because I sort of figured it's hopefully dealt with, but I do see you have to put some more money aside again. So we've done 2017. Does that mean they can do '18 and '19? You might have to put money aside this year? Or a letter of credit aside?Sean Quinn: Sure. We did have the reassessments in 2017 and we put I think $70 million aside, which we expect we'll have to post in the form of a letter of credit. The problem does diminish. The problem with the CRA continues, but the size of the problem diminishes over 2018, 2019, 2020 as the pounds that were sold through our offshore trading structure diminished. So I don't have the exact size of the diminishment in front of me, but it does get smaller as we look forward.Tim Gitzel: Well, thank you, operator, and thank you to everyone who joined today. As Rachelle noted, if you have detailed follow-up questions related to the 2023 results or any questions that we didn't get to today, please send those in to us and we're happy to address them directly. We continue to believe that Cameco remains the best way to invest in the recovery of the nuclear fuel cycle and positive momentum behind nuclear energy. With 35 years of experience in this market, we've built a strong reputation as a proven and reliable supplier with a diversified production portfolio, a portfolio that provides us with the flexibility to work with our customers to ensure they maintain access to our reliable supplies to satisfy their ongoing fuel requirements. The world has put a priority on achieving net zero carbon emissions in the decades to come, and it's become clear that there's no net zero without nuclear. And I would go a step further and say, in fact, there's no nuclear without Cameco and Westinghouse. So it's also becoming clear that there's no net zero without Cameco. We believe we have the right strategy to achieve our vision of energizing the clean air world and we'll do so in a manner that reflects our values. So thanks, everyone, again, for joining us today.

PALM BEACH, Fla., Feb.  21, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FN Media Group News Commentary - According to a report from a RationalStat industry report, the Global Uranium Mining Marketvalue was estimated atUS$ 8,086.6 million in 2023and is expected to rise at a strongCAGR of over 5.0%over the forecast period of 2023-2030. About 66% of the global production of uranium from mines is from Kazakhstan, Canada, and Australia. It also said that the global uranium mining market is expected to reach US$ 11,388.3 million by 2030, with an annual growth rate of more than 5.0%. The uranium mining market is estimated to be 53.0 thousand tons (kt) in 2023. The report added: Uranium mining is the extraction of uranium ore from the ground for use in nuclear power plants and the development of nuclear weapons. Uranium is a radioactive element that occurs naturally in trace amounts in soil, rock, and water. Uranium is primarily used as a fuel in nuclear reactors, where it undergoes nuclear fission to produce energy in the form of heat. Based on the mining method, the open-pit mining segment is the most common method of uranium mining, accounting for over 90% of global uranium production in 2022. Open-pit mining is a relatively simple and inexpensive method of mining, and it is suitable for deposits that are close to the surface. Active mining companies in the markets this week include Stallion Uranium Corp. (TSX-V: STUD) (OTCQB: STLNF), FISSION URANIUM CORP. (OTCQX: FCUUF) (TSX: FCU), Denison Mines Corp (NYSE American: DNN) (TSX: DML), Uranium Energy Corp (NYSE American: UEC), BHP Group Limited (NYSE: BHP).RationalStat continued: Some leading players adopt various strategies in order to reinforce their market share and gain a competitive edge over other competitors in the market. Mergers & acquisitions, partnerships and collaborations, and product launches are some of the strategies followed by industry players. Based on region, the Asia Pacific region is predicted to be the fastest-growing uranium mining market in the next years, owing to the region's increased nuclear power generation. Nuclear power is regarded as a clean energy source because it produces no greenhouse gases when in operation. Countries investing in nuclear energy to cut carbon emissions and battle climate change are boosting the uranium market.Stallion Uranium Corp. (TSX-V: STUD) (OTCQB: STLNF) Completes Largest Airborne Geophysical Survey in Southwestern Athabasca Basin - Survey Area Covered Over 2,200km2, Preliminary Results Reveal Over 560 km of New Conductive Trends - Stallion Uranium Corp. (FSE: HM40) is pleased to announce the preliminary results from the completion of the MobileMTTM airborne geophysical survey (the Survey). The Survey covered the entire 2,200 sq/km of the Atha Energy (CSE: SASK) JV Uranium Project (the Project), a new frontier of exploration in the prolific southwestern Athabasca Basin and part of the largest exploration land package held by Stallion.Stallions strategy to build out the largest exploration land package, taking on a new frontier of exploration in the southwestern Athabasca Basin, has been rewarded with the results of this regional survey, stated Drew Zimmerman, CEO. Utilizing the latest survey technology we have transformed an underexplored land package, uncovering hundreds of kilometers of conductive trends that are highly prospective target areas for uranium mineralization. Not only have we extended known prolific conductive corridors, but we have also been able to uncover completely new zones. We believe the process of identifying, prioritizing, and advancing the best targets from over 2,200sq/km gives our team the potential and probability of finding the next significant uranium discovery.Preliminary Results - The preliminary interpretation of the survey data has changed the landscape in a meaningful way, successfully identifying over 560 km of new conductive trends across the Atha Energy JV Project. This opens a new frontier of exploration in the southwestern Athabasca Basin, as the project area has never had effective exploration. With the completion of the survey, the company has been able to identify and extend new conductive corridors that were previously unknown. These new conductive corridors will be the cornerstone that the next phase of exploration is built on. The survey was able to identify structural complexities, including bends and splays, in the basement geology which suggest favorable conditions for uranium mineralization. These results, along with the advanced 2-D and 3-D inversion modeling, will be used to prioritize the newly identified conductor corridors for the next stages of exploration.Darren Slugoski, VP of Exploration commented, We are incredibly excited to see the quality and number of targets that were identified by the completion of the regional MobileMT survey. The 560 km of conductive corridors identified greatly exceeded our expectations. This survey provides Stallion with a significant number of high priority target areas the company can prioritize and advance towards the drilling.

The battery will not catch fire or explode in response to punctures or even gunshots, unlike some current batteries that can be unsafe if damaged or exposed to high temperatures, says Chinese startup Betavolt ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Chinese company Betavolt claims to have developed a battery that could power mobile phones that never need to be charged and drones that can fly forever. Photo: Betavolt.tech ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A Chinese startup claims to have developed a new battery that could power smartphones for 50 years without the need for charging. Beijing-based Betavolt said its nuclear battery is the first in the world to realise the miniaturisation of atomic energy, placing 63 nuclear isotopes into a module smaller than a coin, reads an Independent article. The battery works by converting the energy released by decaying isotopes into electricity through a process that was first explored in the 20th century. Terming it as the next-generation battery, the company has said the project already entered the pilot testing stage and will eventually be mass-produced for commercial applications like phones and drones. "Betavolt atomic energy batteries can meet the needs of long-lasting power supply in multiple scenarios, such as aerospace, AI equipment, medical equipment, microprocessors, advanced sensors, small drones and micro-robots," the startup said in a press release. "This new energy innovation will help China gain a leading edge in the new round of the AI technological revolution." Betavolt said its first nuclear battery could deliver 100 microwatts of power and a voltage of 3V while measuring 15x15x5 cubic millimetres. It plans to produce a battery with 1 watt of power by 2025. Their small size means they could be used in series to produce more power, with the company imagining mobile phones that never need to be charged and drones that can fly forever. Its layered design also means it will not catch fire or explode in response to a sudden force, Betavolt claims, while also being capable of working in temperatures ranging from -60 degrees Celsius to 120 degrees Celsius. How it works To create the radioactive battery, Betavolt's scientists used nickel-63, which is a radioactive element, as the energy source and then diamond semiconductors as energy converters. The team developed a single-crystal diamond semiconductor that is just 10 microns thick and then placed a 2-micron-thick nickel-63 sheet between two diamond semiconductor converters. The decay energy of the radioactive source is then converted into an electrical current. Betavolt claims the advantages of its atomic energy batteries are their lightweight, long service life, and high energy density, and they can normally work under extreme temperatures from -60 to 120 degrees Celcius. Due to the modular design, multiple atomic batteries could be connected to provide a higher energy output that could power automotive technology and AI systems, just to name a few. Radiation concerns Nuclear energy, however, also comes with concerns regarding radiation. However, Betavolt addressed this concern, stating the battery is safe as it has no external radiation and is suitable for use in medical devices inside the human body, like pacemakers and cochlea implants. "Atomic energy batteries are environmentally friendly. After the decay period, the 63 isotopes turn into a stable isotope of copper, which is non-radioactive and does not pose any environmental threat or pollution," the company said. It could even be safer, too, as Betavolt states that the BV100 will not catch fire or explode in response to punctures or even gunshots, unlike some current batteries that can be unsafe if damaged or exposed to high temperatures. What tiny-sized nuclear batteries mean Scientists in the Soviet Union and the United States were able to develop the technology for use in spacecraft, underwater systems and remote scientific stations. However, the thermonuclear batteries were both costly and bulky. The quest to miniaturise and commercialise nuclear batteries was taken up under China's 14th Five-Year Plan, designed to strengthen the country's economy between 2021 and 2025, while research institutions in the US and Europe are also working on their development, reads the Independent article. This technology could revolutionise electronics by removing the need for chargers or portable power banks altogether, creating devices that run continuously and whose batteries do not degrade in terms of capacity and lifespan over charging cycles as Li-ion batteries do. Such unlimited power could provide drones that fly continuously, phones that run constantly, and electric cars that don't require recharging.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Chinese company Betavolt claims to have developed a battery that could power mobile phones that never need to be charged and drones that can fly forever.

After the decay period, the 63 isotopes turn into a stable isotope of copper, which is non-radioactive and does not pose any environmental threat or pollution," the company said. It could even be safer, too, as Betavolt states that the BV100 will not catch fire or explode in response to punctures or even gunshots, unlike some current batteries that can be unsafe if damaged or exposed to high temperatures. What tiny-sized nuclear batteries mean Scientists in the Soviet Union and the United States were able to develop the technology for use in spacecraft, underwater systems and remote scientific stations. However, the thermonuclear batteries were both costly and bulky. The quest to miniaturise and commercialise nuclear batteries was taken up under China's 14th Five-Year Plan, designed to strengthen the country's economy between 2021 and 2025, while research institutions in the US and Europe are also working on their development, reads the Independent article. This technology could revolutionise electronics by removing the need for chargers or portable power banks altogether, creating devices that run continuously and whose batteries do not degrade in terms of capacity and lifespan over charging cycles as Li-ion batteries do. Such unlimited power could provide drones that fly continuously, phones that run constantly, and electric cars that don't require recharging.A Chinese startup claims to have developed a new battery that could power smartphones for 50 years without the need for charging. Beijing-based Betavolt said its nuclear battery is the first in the world to realise the miniaturisation of atomic energy, placing 63 nuclear isotopes into a module smaller than a coin, reads an Independent article. The battery works by converting the energy released by decaying isotopes into electricity through a process that was first explored in the 20th century. Terming it as the next-generation battery, the company has said the project already entered the pilot testing stage and will eventually be mass-produced for commercial applications like phones and drones. "Betavolt atomic energy batteries can meet the needs of long-lasting power supply in multiple scenarios, such as aerospace, AI equipment, medical equipment, microprocessors, advanced sensors, small drones and micro-robots," the startup said in a press release. "This new energy innovation will help China gain a leading edge in the new round of the AI technological revolution." Betavolt said its first nuclear battery could deliver 100 microwatts of power and a voltage of 3V while measuring 15x15x5 cubic millimetres. It plans to produce a battery with 1 watt of power by 2025. Their small size means they could be used in series to produce more power, with the company imagining mobile phones that never need to be charged and drones that can fly forever. Its layered design also means it will not catch fire or explode in response to a sudden force, Betavolt claims, while also being capable of working in temperatures ranging from -60 degrees Celsius to 120 degrees Celsius. How it works To create the radioactive battery, Betavolt's scientists used nickel-63, which is a radioactive element, as the energy source and then diamond semiconductors as energy converters. The team developed a single-crystal diamond semiconductor that is just 10 microns thick and then placed a 2-micron-thick nickel-63 sheet between two diamond semiconductor converters. The decay energy of the radioactive source is then converted into an electrical current. Betavolt claims the advantages of its atomic energy batteries are their lightweight, long service life, and high energy density, and they can normally work under extreme temperatures from -60 to 120 degrees Celcius. Due to the modular design, multiple atomic batteries could be connected to provide a higher energy output that could power automotive technology and AI systems, just to name a few.

After the decay period, the 63 isotopes turn into a stable isotope of copper, which is non-radioactive and does not pose any environmental threat or pollution," the company said.

This technology could revolutionise electronics by removing the need for chargers or portable power banks altogether, creating devices that run continuously and whose batteries do not degrade in terms of capacity and lifespan over charging cycles as Li-ion batteries do. Such unlimited power could provide drones that fly continuously, phones that run constantly, and electric cars that don't require recharging.Betavolt claims the advantages of its atomic energy batteries are their lightweight, long service life, and high energy density, and they can normally work under extreme temperatures from -60 to 120 degrees Celcius.

The latest details of the proposed Cuffs Run hydroelectric plant can be seen on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission website at elibrary.ferc.gov. Click on Docket Search and enter P-15332 in the Enter Docket Number box to view the preliminary permit application and submitted public comments.The public has through March 31 to comment on York Energy Storage LLCs plan to construct a 1.8-mile-long dam and flood 580 acres in Chanceford Township, York County, to create a hydroelectric facility designed to feed power into the regional grid.The Cuffs Run pumped storage project, named for a Susquehanna River tributary that would become part of the flooded zone, would create a kind of battery. Water pumped uphill from Lake Clarke, the stretch of flat water created by the nearby Safe Harbor Dam, would be held in the newly formed reservoir and then run downhill through turbines to create electricity.Environmental groups see the project as destructive to an as-yet-undisturbed stretch of a river already crowded with hydroelectric plants. The projects developers view the proposed power plant as a key part of the regions transition to renewable energy.Preliminary assessments estimate the projects 1,000-acre total footprint would affect 50 properties, three preserved farms, 2 miles of the Mason-Dixon trail in York County, and hundreds of acres of forest.We feel this is a multicounty issue as to whether we are a community that wants to give up this forest and farmland or fight for it, Lancaster Conservancy CEO Fritz Schroeder said, and we believe it is definitely worth the fight.After public comment closes on April 1, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will review York Energy Storages application and decide whether to grant a preliminary permit. If regulators approve that permit, it will trigger a four-year process of ecological and economic impact studies.The permit application lists more than 20 proposed impact studies, ranging from land surveys to vegetation and wildlife assessments to tax and employment projections, at a total estimated cost of nearly $11 million.Bill McMahon, who runs York Energy Storage with his partner Jan Sockel, has been working on a version of the project since its original proposal in the 1990s. Another attempt stalled in 2011. McMahons current desired timeline would bring the plant online in 2033.The permit application lists an inflation estimate of 3% and a total cost estimate of $2.3 billion, but McMahon said he has since revised the inflation estimate to 4% and raised the total estimated cost to $2.5 billion.If the growth in renewable technology continues to accelerate, solar and wind sources could generate more than the grid can absorb, and that excess energy could be used to pump water at the Cuffs Run plant, McMahon said.In that case, running the water back downhill through the turbines would release energy first generated from solar and wind. That process would be taking advantage of energy that would otherwise be wasted, and that energy could supply the grid at times when solar and wind are not producing, McMahon said.Schroeder said the destruction of carbon-storing, biodiverse forest should also be factored into the projects cost and cited studies that show the organic matter trapped in dam reservoirs generates a significant amount of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. More on the Conservancys objections can be viewed at lancasterconservancy.org/protect-cuffs-run.Federal regulators rejected the permit application, originally submitted in February 2023, multiple times, asking for additional information, particularly about the potential impact on the hydroelectric plant Brookfield Renewable U.S. operates at the Safe Harbor dam.McMahon said he provided Brookfield with a study showing that operating Cuffs Run and Safe Harbor plants at the same time would stabilize water levels in Lake Clarke and make operations more efficient. He added that the study is 30 years old and would be redone if the Cuffs Run project progresses.Brookfield emailed this statement: York Energy Storage has not provided Safe Harbor Water Power Corporation with the information necessary to adequately assess their claims concerning the impacts of the YES Project on our Safe Harbor Project.Republican state Sen. Kristin Phillips-Hill of York joined 17 nonprofit and local government groups in signing a July 2023 letter urging federal regulators to reject York Energy Storages application for a preliminary permit.This project does nothing but ravage pristine and preserved farmland in York County, as well as put historic and popular tourist destinations along the Susquehanna River underwater. This proposal is yet another attempt by out-of-town developers to destroy lives and livelihoods for the benefit of Maryland, which will not generate or stabilize their own power, Phillips-Hill said in an emailed statement on Tuesday.The full list of signers on the July letter includes the Cuffs Run Alliance, Farm & Natural Lands Trust of York County, Lancaster Conservancy, Lower Susquehanna Riverkeeper Association, Susquehanna National Heritage Area, Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Chesapeake Conservancy, Chesapeake Legal Alliance, City of Lancaster, Keystone Trails Association, Lancaster Farmland Trust, Mason-Dixon Trail System, PennFuture, Penns Valley Conservation Association, Waterkeepers Chesapeake, Watershed Alliance of York and WeConservePA.Evgeniadis said community engagement efforts have included reaching out to the Office of Public Participation at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to discuss hosting a public forum in Chanceford Township.
Scope: Using graphs, Roy Spencer demonstrates that his graphic techniques of presenting datasets reveal differences in data rather than hiding them. In another post, Spencer explores why different time periods fit different models better than other time periods. As discussed in two reports, the high cost of wind and solar power has become evident in Europe. Mann v. Steyn is discussed including the view of climatologist Judith Curry.Hide or Reveal? Richard Feynman set a high goal for scientific research when he wrote: The first principle is that you must not fool yourself  and you are the easiest person to fool. Many of those who are motivated by a passionate interest in a topic easily fool themselves by ignoring data that questions their desired result or adjusting the data to give their views the most favorable impact. The graphs presented by Al Gore in the movie The inconvenient truth are an example. He shows graphs indicating that temperatures and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations move together based on Antarctic ice cores. He claims this proves that changes in carbon dioxide concentrations cause temperature changes.Actually, it does not. The graphs just show that there may be a correlation. Certainly, based on experiments, carbon dioxide is absorbed more readily in cold water than warm water, and as water warms CO2 is released. This can be seen in ocean upwelling, which are rich primary producers of aquatic sea life. They bring to the surface cold water that is rich in carbon dioxide, nitrogen and phosphorus promoting phytoplankton which begins the energy base for a complex food chain including providing food for fish, marine mammals, seabirds, and other creatures.Numerous studies have pointed out that Mr. Gore had the timelines wrong to claim causation. In general, temperature changes occurred before CO2 changes, by an average of about 800 years. Al Gore has no explanation for the actual timeline which he hid, probably unintentionally. Al Gore fooled himself on the timeline, thus the causation claim.Since the blogosphere continues to amplify Gavin Schmidts claim that the way John Christy and I plot temperature time series data is some form of trickery, I have come up with a way to demonstrate its superiority. Following a suggestion by Heritage Foundation chief statistician Kevin Dayaratna, I will do this using only climate model data, and not comparing the models to observations. That way, no one can claim I am displaying the data in such a way to make the models look bad.The goal here is to plot multiple temperature time series on a single graph in such a way their different rates of long-term warming (usually measured by linear warming trends) are best reflected by their placement on the graph, without hiding those differences.Lets start with 32 CMIP6 climate model projections of global annual average surface air temperature for the period 1979 through 2100 (Plot A) and for which we have equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) estimates (Ive omitted 2 of the 3 Canadian model simulations, which produce the most warming and are virtually the same).Here, I am using the raw temperatures out of the models (not anomalies). As can be seen in Plot A, there are rather large biases between models which tend to obscure which models warm the most and which warm the least. [graph not shown here]Next, if we plot the departures of each models temperature from the full-period (1979-2100) average, we see in Plot B that the discrepancies between models warming rates are divided between the first and second half of the record, with the warmest models by 2100 having the coolest temperature anomalies in 1979, and the coolest models in 2100 having the warmest temperatures in 1979. Clearly, this isnt much of an improvement, especially if one wants to compare the models early in the record right? [graph no shown here]Finally, I show the method John Christy and I have been using for quite a few years now, which is to align the time series such that their linear trends all intersect in the first year, here 1979 (Plot E). Ive previously discussed why this seems the most logical method, but clearly not everyone is convinced.What we want is a method of graphing where the model differences in long-term warming rates show up as early as possible in the record. For example, imagine you are looking at a specific year, say 1990 we want a way to display the model temperature differences in that year that have some relationship to the models long-term rates of warming.Of course, each model already has a metric of how much warming it produces, through their diagnosed equilibrium (or effective) climate sensitivities, ECS. So, all we have to do is, in each separate year, correlate the model temperature metrics in Plots A, B, C, D, and E with the models ECS values (see plot, below).I hope this is sufficient evidence of the superiority of our way of plotting different time series when the intent is to reveal differences in long-term trends, rather than hide those differences. [Boldface was italics in original]As TWTW has frequently stated, the climate model data is near surface-air data. There are no standards regarding where the temperatures are taken, time of day, instrumentation, or frequency. Even in the US which once was the gold standard, as Anthony Watts and his team have shown, the standards for the US are overwhelmingly ignored. Further, as Tony Heller has shown, the data have been so heavily manipulated by politicized government agencies that the original data has been lost. There is no question that there is a greenhouse effect which keeps the land masses on earth warm enough to support complex life and carbon dioxide (a gas critical for green life which creates food for all complex life) is a secondary greenhouse gas, after water vapor (another gas critical for life on Earth). See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy and Measurement Issues  Surface & Lowering Standards for some of Hellers recent work.When computing temperature trends in the context of global warming we must choose a region (U.S.? global? etc.) and a time period (the last 10 years? 50 years? 100 years?) and a season (summer? winter? annual?). Obviously, we will obtain different temperature trends depending upon our choices. But what significance do these choices have in the context of global warming?Obviously, if we pick the most recent 10 years, such a short period can have a trend heavily influenced by an El Nino at the beginning and a La Nina at the end (thus depressing the trend)  or vice versa.Alternatively, if we go too far back in time (say, before the mid-20th Century), increasing CO2 in the atmosphere cannot have much of an impact on the temperatures before that time. Inclusion of data too far back will just mute the signal we are looking for.One way to investigate this problem is to look at climate model output across many models to see how their warming trends compare to those models diagnosed equilibrium climate sensitivities (ECS). I realize climate models have their own problems, but at least they generate internal variability somewhat like the real world, for instance with El Ninos and La Ninas scattered throughout their time simulations.Ive investigated this for 34 CMIP6 models having data available at the KNMI Climate Explorer website which also has published ECS values. The following plot shows the correlation between the 34 models ECS and their temperature trends through 2023, but with different starting years.The peak correlation occurs around 1945, which is when CO2 emissions began to increase substantially, after World War II. But there is a reason why the correlations start to fall off after that date. [Boldface added]If those models had not differed so much in their aerosol forcing, one could presumable have picked a later starting date than 1945 for meaningful temperature trend computation. Note the differences remain large even by 2015, which is reaching the point of not being useful anyway for trend computations through 2023.The entire exercise demonstrates the absurdity of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its followers to seek an equilibrium climate. As Richard Lindzen has shown, Earth has dozens of climates that are constantly changing that cannot be measured by temperature. In addition, we did not have good measurements of ocean temperatures until the Argo float program which began in 1999.Energy Transition: Western governments are trying to force an energy transition onto their populations that the people clearly do not want for a number of reasons primarily because alternatives to traditional electrical generation do not provide affordable, reliable electricity. In short, politicians trying to enforce such measures are incredibly naive (foolish).Last week, TWTW discussed the views of noted security specialist, Professor emeritus Gwythian Prins of the London School of Economics (and Political Science) on the Net Zero plan of replacing coal, oil, and natural gas with wind and solar creating a national security problem for the UK. His report, Archimedes Fulcrum was published by Net Zero Watch.This week, Net Zero Watch published Retreat from Net Zero is under way by Ross Clark, a lead writer and columnist at the Spectator as well as a frequent contributor to several national newspapers including the Daily Telegraph, Daily Mail and the Express. His concepts are easy to understand, and he addresses many of the failures of new energy. His views may be too optimistic, for the beast may be difficult to kill.Paul Homewood directed us to The Struggle to Achieve Net Zero Emissions  While Balancing Security, Affordability and Sustainability by Morten Springborg of C WorldWide Asset Management, a fund manager based in Copenhagen and registered in the US and UK. It was formerly known as Carnegie Asset Management. The report starts with a quote from a dramatically successful woman from a poor white family in Appalachia (US) which sums the problems of energy transition:Despite rapidly rising investments, the decarbonization of our energy systems continues to progress too slowly. The transition is failing because the chosen strategy is not aligned with the Energy Trilemma constraints of security, affordability, and sustainability. Focusing solely on solar and wind will not get us to the net zero target. Measured in primary energy terms, renewables have very low power density, and therefore, solar and wind should only be used for direct electrification where the energy losses are lowest.In this paper, we will begin describing our predicament today, and in a follow-up paper, we will focus on the solutions: Diversified energy systems, technology, and improved energy efficiency. Advanced nuclear fission, and fusion from the 2030s, as well as nature-based carbon sinks, natural gas, and energy efficiency as described in our White Paper from 2021. We should not blindly pursue short-term CO2 reduction targets, which can only be met at excessively high costs to our societies; the price is long-term decarbonization, and there will be a hockey stick development when the right technologies are available.From Main Street media to academia and Wall Street brokerage research, an unrelenting chant has been heard for years: wind and solar are the cheapest forms of electricity. In more technical terms, solar and wind are claimed to have the lowest levelized cost of energy (LCOE), and therefore transitioning to a renewable-based energy system is not only good for the environment but also good for the economy as it lowers the cost of energy. Politicians, NGOs, and, importantly, more and more dominant green companies have been claiming this so loudly that arguing the opposite has become highly controversial. Canceled off-shore wind auctions, declining share prices of renewable energy companies, and the extremely volatile  and over time  higher electricity prices and degraded grid reliability almost everywhere where wind and solar have achieved meaningful market penetration have gone almost unnoticed by this green agenda.Very simply, as long as alternative sources remain unreliable and expensive, civilization will need traditional sources such as nuclear, hydroelectric, and fossil fuels, which the greens irrationally oppose and invent arguments against.The UN meetings on climate change have become renowned for their platitudes, with national leaders falling over each other to say what disparate straits the world is in, how we must decarbonize ever faster  before returning to their home countries and putting economic development well ahead of their promises to cut emissions. But the president of COP28 in Dubai in December 2023, Sultan Al Jaber, was unusually frank. Al Jaber, who also serves as the chair of Abu Dhabi state oil corporation, ADNOC, which recently announced a $150 billion investment to increase oil production by nearly 50 percent to 5 million barrels a day by 2027, appealed to former Irish President Mary Robinson: show me a road map for the phase out of fossil fuel that allows for social, sustainable developmentunless you want to take the world back into caves.Al Jaber was eviscerated for his comments, yet they were in tune with a silent majority. An analysis by the website Zero Tracker reveals that even countries with net zero targets are heavily resisting pressure to phase out exploration for and development of fossil fuel resources. There are 93 oil-producing countries that have net zero targets, but only six of them have plans to phase out oil. Only five out of 94 gas-producing countries with a net zero target have plans to phase out gas. As for coal-producing countries, only 65 of those with net zero targets have plans to stop production.As always with COP meetings, the event ended with a communiqu promising that the world would try to transition away from fossil fuels  which is a long way from agreeing to phase them out by a certain date, as many activists demanded. After two weeks and several hundred thousands of tonnes [metric tons] of carbon dioxide spewed out by private jets and the like, the 98,000 delegates who had signed up for COP28 had come up with nothing more than an empty promise.In fact, the list of countries with plans to phase out fossil fuels is showing few signs of growing. The new government in New Zealand has just reneged on the previous administrations pledge to do so. In Germany, Federal Economics Minister Robert Habeck recently announced that he may delay the countrys planned phase-out of coal by 2030 because of the energy crisis provoked by the invasion of Ukraine.Clark then goes into details such as fossil fuel use has never been greater, the costs on wind and solar are far greater than promoted, hydrogen power is losing its puff, small nuclear reactors are not appearing as expected, and EVs are running out of juice. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy and Questioning European Green.Mann v. Steyn: The jury trial in a Washington DC court is over, and the jury found in favor of Mr. Mann. A number of commentators have expressed their views. TWTW finds the entire show akin to the Scopes Monkey Trial in 1925 which was claimed by the winning side to prove that human evolution was a false concept. It did not.As with the Scopes trial, in Mann v. Stein physical evidence was never presented. The only expert testimony allowed was by Professor of Statistics and Data Science Abraham Wyner of Warton, University of Pennsylvania. No doubt he is an accomplished statistician, but does he understand the physical evidence required and the quality of that evidence?The expert testimony prepared by climatologist Judith Curry and statistician Stephen McKitrick, both of whom understand the physical evidence required for understanding the problem was not admitted. As with the Scopes Trial, the clear loser in the trial was the scientific method and scientific integrity. The victor was institutionalized science, which may or may not contradict nature, the ultimate judge in natural sciences.I submit this report under D.C. Superior Court Civil Rule 26(a)(2)(B) & (C) as both fact and expert witness to address the subject matter on which I expect to present evidence and to summarize the facts and opinions on which I expect to testify. This report includes my observations and opinions as a lay and expert witness concerning three principal topics: (I) the nature of the scientific and public controversy concerning the Hockey Stick graph; (II) whether the Hockey Stick graph can be regarded as fraudulent; and (III) Michael Manns role in the downward spiral of climate science discourse. I present sections (I) and (III) mostly in my capacity as a fact/lay opinion witness and section (II) in my capacity as an expert witness.Michael Mann claims to be the victim of a Serengeti strategy by political opponents of climate change policies. Mann has arguably been singled out for attacks because he has violated the norms of science: (a) withheld data from scientists who are critical of his work; (b) stifled criticism of his work within the IPCC and by distorting the peer review process; and (c) employed what he calls the Serengeti strategy to attack scientists who disagree with him.Of specific relevance to this lawsuit, Mann has been instrumental in the downward spiral of discourse surrounding climate change, the very thing that he decries in this lawsuit. His loose use of the word fraudulent with regards to research that is critical of his own plus characterizing people that he disagrees with as professional liar for hire, denier, anti-science, among other things, contributes to an anything goes environment for discourse surrounding this controversial and contentious topic.Number of the Week: $4 Trillion. In his report The Struggle to Achieve Net Zero Emissions  While Balancing Security, Affordability and Sustainability Morten Springborg references Statista that over the past 20 years new investment in renewable energy worldwide has been over $4 Trillion. Yet, no one has a demonstration project showing how much it would cost to make renewable energy reliable. As Dolly Parton reportedly said:To get some sense of powerful political agenda influences on global climate and environmental policies, its instructive to revisit the acid rain hysteria of the late 1960s which led quite directly to demonization of carbon dioxide (CO2) as a climate pollutant. Sadly, I admit that I have personal responsibility for initiating that transition of the acid rain hysteria into becoming the more serious global warming scare.Scientists with the European Union on Thursday announced their finding that temperatures over the past 12 months were 1.52 degrees Celsius (2.74 degrees Fahrenheit) higher than the average preindustrial temperatures between the years 1850 and 1900.The material reviewed so far in this paper confirms that there are a large number of factors that affect the earths climate. Many of these are poorly understood by man, and there are some factors that probably havent even been discovered yet.Chinas attitude to coal has been hard to swallow for Europe and other transition advocates but Beijing has made a point of explaining that on its list of priorities, energy security comes before energy transition.From article: It can happen almost anywhere but should be unlikely in Alberta  an emergency alert asking residents to reduce electricity usage to avert rolling blackouts. After all, Alberta has the worlds fourth-largest proven oil reserves and enough proven natural gas to meet Canadas domestic needs for hundreds of years. So, the crisis was self-inflicted, a result of excessive reliance on intermittent renewable energy. Its a wake-up call for Alberta but it should be for the rest of Canada, too.From the abstract: Here, for the first time, physics-based hydrodynamic flood models driven by rainfall and storm surge simultaneously are used to estimate the magnitude and frequency of compound flooding events. We apply this to the particular case of New York City. We find that sea level rise (SLR) alone will increase the TC and ETC compound flooding hazard more significantly than changes in storm climatology as the climate warms. We also project that the return period of destructive Sandy-like compound flooding will increase by up to five times by the end of the century. Our results have strong implications for climate change adaptation in coastal communities.By comparing minimum and maximum proxy temperatures over the Little Ice Age (~1300 to ~1850) and comparing them to minimum and maximum modern daily instrumental measurements since 1900, Neukom, et al. would have us believe that the modern warm period is unique. We have thousands of weather stations, ocean buoys, and ARGO floats around the world today. It is well known that daily temperature extremes often exceed 30C, which is more than 70 times the differences being estimated by Neukom, et al. as shown in figure 5, which is from their paper. These daily extremes are captured in instrumental data, but only seen occasionally, by pure chance, inaccurately, and in a very naturally smoothed way in the proxies. The proxies under sample both the high and low temperatures. Further, accuracy decreases backward in time.[SEPP Comment: The Argo float program began in 1999 and the data for calculation of atmospheric temperature trends started in 1979. Without establishing control periods or calibration periods, we have no basis for comparing current temperature trends with historic temperature trends from various proxies.][SEPP Comment: By the 1970s it was clear for those who studied the participation history of the area that the 1922 Colorado River Compact, dividing up the water between the upper basin and the lower basin (totaling seven states), was based on an unusually wet period.]Back then [before Cyrus McCormick invented the mechanical reaper], farmings efficiency hadnt changed much since the time of the pyramids. A man, using a scythe, could harvest approximately one acre of grain a day. [and approximately 80% of American population was involved in agriculture].

Roughly a billion gallons of water each day is slurped from the Colorado River to feed the thirst of San Diego and Los Angeles. If the population of California is roughly 40 million, that means each person guzzles 25 gallons each day. Something to think about. How much goes to stupid lawns which people never even use? How much goes to growing food that feeds 49 other states?On the other hand, Manns lawyer seemed to think that his best proof of actual malice lay in the NSF report finding no research misconduct by Mann. Making actual malice provable this way essentially means that members of the public are required to accept an official government party line to avoid exposing themselves to ruinous defamation suits. Maybe, just maybe, that argument could draw interest from the Supreme Court.In a small note of optimism, I suspect that Steyn can get help if he wants it from pro bono lawyers to proceed with appeals. Alternatively, he may decide that his best approach is to leave the United States and not pay the judgment. That is the approach that Mann has taken with the judgment issued against him in Canada for his failed defamation suit against Tim Ball.As the climate continues to change, millions of poor people face increasing challenges in terms of extreme events, health effects, food, water, and livelihood security, migration and forced displacement, loss of cultural identity, and other related risks.Speaking of the dreaded carbon footprint of farming, no sooner are we told to plant micro-gardens to calm our climate anxiety than a story blares Carbon footprint of homegrown food five times greater than those grown conventionally. Yaaaaaah!Congress this week will hold hearings on the permit freeze for new liquefied natural gas (LNG) export projects that President Biden announced two weeks ago. The closer one looks, the more harm this raw political payoff to the climate left will do to U.S. national security and economic interests.The White House has been whispering to its European allies not to worry about its moratoriums impact on LNG supply even as it crows to the climate lobby. Progressives are celebrating because they know the putative pause will shrink investment in LNG. Merely read the plaudits from climate potentates on the White House website.The Biden administration is listening to the calls to break Americas reliance on dirty fossil fuels, Sierra Club executive director Ben Jealous proclaimed. Its undeniable that LNG export projects are simply not in the public interest and we are confident that if this review is done right, that would end the rubber-stamping of these projects. Got that, Mr. President?The Energy Department is required by law to approve permits to export LNG to countries with which the U.S. doesnt have free-trade agreements if they are in the public interest. The department has never rejected a permit. But now the Administration plans to do so by redefining public interest to include the potential impact on the climate.The White House says the pause will only affect a handful of projects that are currently seeking Energy Department permits, but this is dishonest. It will also freeze about a half a dozen projects seeking Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approvals and could halt another dozen or so that have been permitted by previous Presidents.Thats because the Energy Department in December announced that projects not yet operating will have to reapply for permits if its been seven years since they were authorized. So projects in the works could get deep-sixedeven if they have billions of dollars in committed capital and contractual agreements with customers.While the Administration downplays the national-security risks of its self-embargo, U.S. allies worry it will make them more vulnerable to geopolitical disruptions. About 20% of the global LNG supply travels through the Strait of Hormuz. LNG cargoes to Europe are now being diverted from the Red Sea because of Houthi missile attacks.Russian and Iranian proxies could cause LNG prices to spike by attacking one or two large Qatar export facilities. Some countries in Asia might then burn more coal as they did in 2022 when LNG prices shot up. But Europeans are planning to retire coal and nuclear plants in the coming years on the expectation that they will have ample LNG from the U.S.As for Americas economic interests, a single LNG export project will produce about $600 billion in revenue over its lifespan and create thousands of jobs, including in steel manufacturing and frackingno government subsidies required.Venture Globals Gulf Coast CP2 could supply about 5% of the worlds LNG by 2026 and would have a bigger impact on the U.S. economy than any green energy project. It would also reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by 140 million tons a yearabout as much as all container ships in the world produce. But it still needs an Energy Department permit.Remember Nancy Pelosis famous line that Democrats had to pass ObamaCare to learn what was in it? Democrats in Sacramento are now having second thoughts about a law they passed two years ago that would effectively establish a second progressive income tax in California.Democrats last week introduced legislation to repeal a 2022 budget bill that authorized the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to restructure electricity rates by imposing a fixed charge on an income-graduated basis. The budget bills purpose was to reduce the states skyrocketing rates for lower-income people and shift utility costs to higher earners.One culprit is the states aggressive green-energy buildout, which has required batteries to back up intermittent solar and wind. Another is the states net-metering program, which generously compensates households with solar panels for excess power they send to the grid. This has shifted costs for maintaining the grid to homes without solar panels.Lawmakers have also shifted state government costs for wildfire mitigation and climate subsidies to utilities so the politicians can devote more spending to their public-union friends. At the same time the state has mandated that utilities provide discounts to lower-income customers. These discounts get baked into higher rates for all customers.The climate lobby frets that soaring electricity rates will discourage low- and middle-income Californians from buying electric vehicles (though they are also an inducement to install solar panels). Thus, Gov. Gavin Newsom two years ago pressured the Legislature to pass the budget bill to establish the nations first income-based electricity rates.The PUC hasnt finalized the new electric rate structures. But Pacific Gas & Electric Company has floated charging customers fixed fees ranging from $15 a month for those earning less than $28,000 annually and up to $92 a month for those making $180,000 or more. Income-based charges on higher earners will rise as utility costs do.Ten state Senators recently sent a letter urging the PUC to reject utilities proposed income charges. Californians already pay some of the highest electric bills in the nation and should not be forced to arbitrarily pay more to cover for a private utilitys poor business decisions, San Francisco progressive Sen. Scott Wiener declared.Nothey will be forced to pay more to compensate for Sacramentos bad policy decisions. The progressive epiphany in Sacramento is welcome, belated as it may be. Maybe California isnt completely lost.What people want  if it runs counter to the political direction mapped out by the elected dictatorship  is often described crudely as populism  something that is popular with the majority of voting people.As The Guardians Timothy Garton Ash put it:When I see the term populism used, I know the author is referring to a movement the author he or she doesnt like. That is what it does. It signals to the listener that the thing they are deprecating is to be deprecated.Back n the 80s an organization attempting to get a constitutional proposition onto the Californai ballet to force a change in income tax basis and regulations led whit the declaration that no economic activity is of any value save by virtue of being controlled by government, therefore government has an intrinsic right to part of every transaction.Im 69, retired from a fairly demanding technical career. My preference would be to (as the Indians charmingly say go F off now). But it seems I have to learn about this vast subject. Its not simple or easy. I dont enter the fray, as Im not competent enough to make useful comments. Ive my gut feel (which has been pretty reliable IME) about the whole climate thing  its a monstrous fraud.

He argued that rapid population growth would prevent China from becoming a rich, modern country,The problem with many models, but especially climate and in this case population models, is that they take a single factor and to the exclusion of everything else, assume that this single factor is the only one that matters.  Not just for now, but far into the future.This just came across my feed. This is whats happening in the north Mojave Desert. If this sticks, Id say Mojave Pistachio (a billion dollar operation) will pull out as $30 million per year fee for pumping 15,000 acre-feet isnt going to make a profit (sarc). Ive no sympathy for MP, at all. You had to be here to understand the ruthless tactics this company used to exploit CA water law and try to crush this community  they really do intend to suck all of the water out without any consideration of the 30,000 people who live here.Ive plenty of misgivings about all of this, I dont like some of the language in this court ruling  it smacks of ever-increasing government power. On the other hand, Im one of the small and weak that was being crushed by this heartless corporation. I doubt these fees will ever be used to bring more water into the basin, but Im hoping this is a stake through the heart of this water vampire, And the enviable coming water crisis is at least delayed.FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Carol Thomas-Keefer 650-587-7300 X17 cthomaskeefer@rgs.ca.gov COURT OF APPEALS RULES IN FAVOR OF INDIAN WELLS VALLEY GROUNDWATER AUTHORITY IN FEE CHALLENGE BROUGHT BY DESERT PISTACHIO GROWERFebruary 8, 2024  Ridgecrest, CA  In a groundbreaking published opinion described as having great public importance that could impact thousands of water users throughout the state for years to come, the California Court of Appeals denied a request to avoid paying a fee needed to preserve groundwater resources brought by a farmer that used the water to grow pistachio trees in an arid desert. The court also barred any claims for damages associated with the imposition of the fee and questioned the farmers right to use water in such a seemingly frivolous manner.The dispute arose based on a replenishment fee adopted by the Indian Wells Valley Groundwater Authority (IWVGA). The Authority was formed by Kern County, Inyo County, San Bernardino County, the Indian Wells Valley Water District, and the City of Ridgecrest to address the critical overdraft of the Indian Wells Valley Groundwater Basin, which spans approximately 600 square miles across parts of Kern, Inyo, and San Bernardino Counties. With no significant surface water or importation infrastructure, the basin is the regions sole source of water. The Department of Water Resources has identified the basin as critically overdrafted, with groundwater levels declining since 1945. The IWVGA estimates a loss of groundwater storage of about 25,000 acre-feet per year.Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, the largest landholding by the U.S. Navy globally, is situated within the basin, accounting for a portion of groundwater extraction. The remaining area supports residential and agricultural activities, including the party that brought the lawsuit, Mojave Pistachios, which cultivates pistachios in this arid region. Mojave Pistachio claimed the legal right to use nearly all of the available water to support its nut cultivation.The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) mandates the creation of groundwater sustainability plans. IWVGAs plan explained that the Basin is solely dependent on groundwater; current outflows are about four times the estimated inflows; groundwater levels are dropping by up to 2.5 feet annually; the Basin does not currently have access to imported water; and up to 50 miles of infrastructure must be built to import water. To finance this critical infrastructure, IWVGA determined the need for a fee from those benefiting from the projects. Ordinance No. 03-20, effective January 2021, instituted a Basin replenishment fee of $2,130 per acre-foot. From 2021 to the present, Mojave has continued to pump water from the basin at an alarming rate while failing to pay the fee  claiming instead that payment was unnecessary because the fee was an illegal infringement on their water rights.In a sharply written, published legal opinion, the California Court of Appeals disagreed. The court confirmed the trial courts prior decision to throw out Mojaves legal claims against the fee. In doing so, the court applied the pay first, litigate later rule, which is a principle that requires taxpayers to pay a disputed tax before they can challenge it in court. The pay first rule is important because it allows for the continuation of revenue collection during litigation, ensuring that government operations reliant on such funds are not interrupted.Before today, no court had determined whether the pay first rule applied in cases challenging fees imposed by a groundwater sustainability agency under SGMA. In a first of its kind decision, the court applied the pay first rule to the replenishment fee, stating that any legal challenge to the fee, which is aimed at managing the critically overdrafted groundwater basin, must be preceded by the payment of the fee, even if the fee is contested as violating SGMA or California water law.As the court noted: If groundwater extractors like Mojave can challenge a fee without first paying it, that could defeat SGMAs goal of managing overdrafted groundwater basins. The court also found that Mojave Pistachios could not pursue any damages claims against the Authority based on the fee as these claims had also been waived.In a stunning rebuke of Mojave Pistachios claims about the size of the fee the court noted Benjamin Franklins famous quote: When the wells dry, we know the worth of water. The court reminded them that the fee was not even very high given the costs it intended to pay. The Replenishment Fee . . . is not grossly out of line with the fees charged by other agencies.In the most striking part of the decision the court also questioned whether Mojave Pistachios even had any right to water in the first place. The court noted that groundwater belongs to the state, not any person or entity and that water rights holders have the right to take and use water, but they do not own the water and cannot waste it . The court asked: Is using the Basins limited groundwater to irrigate a water-intensive crop like pistachios in the middle of the high desert a reasonable and beneficial use of water protected under the California Constitution, particularly considering most of those trees were planted less than 10 years ago?With this issue now settled, the Authority will renew its legal motion to require Mojave Pistachios to pay fees for the water that it has improperly used. The Authority will seek to have this matter resolved in the next few months. ### Note: This press release is for informational purposes only and does not reflect any legal advice or opinion on the ongoing legal proceedings


MANILA, Philippines  The long-term nuclear plan outlined by the Department of Energy (DOE) is too long, too late due to the climate emergency, a climate analyst said, suggesting instead the prioritization of building renewable energy facilities.Prioritize renewable energy, primarily solar and wind as the alternative to fossil fuels because solar and wind are ready now and there is no need to wait 10 years, Asian Peoples Movement on Debt and Development (APMDD) senior lead Paolo Pagaduan told The STAR.We have to make sure its safe, that theres no risk of us getting into a disaster. We need to follow each and every rule because if you are rushing because you want it fast, then you might bypass some other requirements, Garin told The STAR.The design and construction also needed to be factored in, particularly the standard materials in building the power plant. Since the Philippines is a member of the IAEA, the construction of nuclear energy facilities must be pursuant to the international guidelines.
Police in Mersin, Turkey, confirmed on Tuesday that they had arrested an unnamed man working at the construction site of the Russian-built Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant in connection with an investigation into the Islamic State.According to a translation of a Mersin police statement by the Turkish outlet Duvar, authorities said that the person in question was an employee at the future nuclear power plant site and had obtained work there using a false identity. The person was identified only by the initials U.A. and allegedly found to be a Russian citizen, though some reports conflict with that information and state that his nationality remains publicly unknown.An aerial view of the Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) construction site as the first unit is planned to deploy after the preparation, pretesting and arriving of the nuclear fuel to the site on Apr. 27, in Mersin, Turkey, on April 19, 2023. (Ercin Erturk/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)Rosatom, Russias state nuclear power company, is in charge of the construction of the Akkuyu facility. Once completed, it will be Turkeys first nuclear power plant. Islamist President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has celebrated the project as elevating Turkeys geopolitical profile by allowing it to enter the club of nuclear-capable states and the plant as boasting state-of-the-art security features.The police announcementof the Islamic State-linked detention on Tuesday included photos of the man being arrested, but no specifics on why, aside from the use of fake identification, he was detained or what kind of criminal charges he may face. It is unclear at press time what the mans job was at the Akkuyu site. Police also did not directly state if the man was believed to be a member of the Islamic State, only that his arrest occurred within the scope of the work carried out by our Intelligence and Counter-Terrorism Branch Directorates against the Islamic State.The arrest has raised alarm in Turkey, which experienced its first terrorist attack attributed to the Islamic State in seven years in late January. Two terrorists opened fire on Catholics congregating for Mass in Istanbuls Santa Maria Church on January 28, killing one person. Eyewitnesses said the low death count appeared to be in part the result of at least one of the guns used in the attack jamming.The Islamic States Amaq news agency confirmed that the attackers belonged to the Sunni jihadist terrorist group, applauding them for havingattacked a gathering of Christian unbelievers during their polytheistic ceremony.Turkish authorities identified the two gunmen as citizens of Russia and Tajikistan and subsequently engaged in police raids against individuals suspected of having played a role in the attack. Turkish police announced on January 30 that they had arrested 47 people as a result of investigations into the church shooting. As of last week, the number of people arrested for alleged ties to the Islamic State in Turkey has risen to 147.Prior to the shooting in January, Turkeys most recent Islamic State terrorist attack occurred on the New Years Eve welcoming 2017. An Islamic State terrorist later identified as Usbek national Abdulkadir Masharipov stormed Istanbuls Reina nightclub during one of its busiest nights and opened first, killing 39 people and injuring dozens of others. Masharipov reportedly confessed to the shooting.In this Wednesday, Jan. 4, 2017, file photo, a man adjusts a victims photograph displayed with floral tributes and Turkish flags, outside the Reina night club following the New Years day attack, in Istanbul. (AP Photo/Emrah Gurel, file)The Reina nightclub attack occurred a little less than six months after the 2016 bombing of Istanbuls Atatrk Airport. Unlike the nightclub shooting, no individual or group ever took responsibility for the attack, later described as a triple suicide bombing, but Turkish police said evidence indicated that it was an Islamic State operation.While Turkey had not experienced any mass-casualty Islamic State terrorist attacks since 2017, Turkish officials consistently described the group as a threat and occasionally announced operations against suspected jihadists. A month before the Istanbul church shooting, the Turkish Interior Ministry announced that it had detained 304 people in a wave of police raids nationwide, all suspected of some association with the Islamic State.The arrest on Tuesday has raised concerns about a potential terrorist attack targeting the nuclear power plant site, which has been plagued by setbacks and controversy for nearly a decade and technically conceived of almost half a century ago. Turkish authorities first issued a license to build a nuclear energy facility at the site in 1976 but reconsidered the project following the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster, according to the Associated Press. Turkey first held a groundbreaking ceremony at the Akkuyu site in 2015 and claimed that Rosatom would complete the project by at the earliest 2022.Shortly after the announcement of construction beginning, the Turkish military shot down a Russian warplane over Syria, chilling relations between the two countries and prompting global concern that Erdogan had inadvertently dragged NATO, of which Turkey is a member, into conflict with Russia. Ankara and Moscow ultimately resolved the tensions  stemming from Russias support of Syrian dictator Bashar Assad, whose regime Erdogan had at one time promised to end  and Erdogan announced the groundbreaking of Akkuyu for a second time in 2018.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan waits for the start of a round table meeting of the North Atlantic Council during a NATO summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, on July 11, 2023. (AP Photo/Mindaugas Kulbis, File)Construction continued quietly, with the exception of protests from anti-nuclear power activists, for years, but 2022 came and went without completion of the plant. In early 2023, Turkey experienced one of the worst natural disasters in its history: a series of earthquakes that killed upwards of 40,000 people near the border with Syria. The earthquakes renewed anxiety surrounding Akkuyu, which is located about 200 miles from the epicenter of the largest of the earthquakes. Authorities insisted, however, that the power plant was being built with protective measures to keep it safe and operational in the face of much larger tremors than those experienced in 2023 in the region.

Flowserves fourth quarter performance marked a strong finish to a very solid year of improved execution and consistent progress. Our financial and operating performance throughout 2023 supported raising our full year revenue and adjusted EPS guidance 3 different times as we significantly exceeded our original expectations. For the full year, we achieved year-over-year revenue growth of nearly 20%, driven by enhanced backlog conversion and operational improvement while delivering higher adjusted gross and operating margins. As a result, our adjusted earnings per share increased by over 90%, and our operating cash flow improved by over $360 million compared to 2022. Bookings exceeded $4.25 billion for just the second time since 2016, which supported our strong year-end backlog of $2.7 billion. Most importantly, Flowserve entered 2024 well positioned to drive continued momentum and success, and we are well on our way towards achieving our 2027 financial targets that were communicated last September. I want to sincerely thank all of our associates around the world for their efforts and dedication throughout the year. Our commitment to serving our customers and their passion for our business are critical to driving exceptional financial results. Im very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, including our adjusted earnings per share of $0.68, which brought our full year adjusted EPS to $2.10. We are seeing the impact of our improved operating model higher backlog conversion and significantly better financial performance. These improvements drove fourth quarter sales of nearly $1.2 billion and expanded our sequential adjusted operating margins to 10.5%. We also delivered $195 million of operating cash flow during the quarter, which was driven primarily by our earnings and strong working capital performance. This was a clear highlight for us as we are beginning to deliver improvements in our inventory management as our supply chain continues to normalize and lead times shorten. Our markets remain supportive as we delivered over $1 billion in bookings for the eighth consecutive quarter. While our full year 2023 book-to-bill was just below 1.0x, our backlog remains at a very healthy $2.7 billion as we entered 2024. Let me now provide some additional color on our fourth quarter bookings. General market activity remains high, and we generated bookings of $1.04 billion in the quarter. We achieved this level due to the success of our 3D growth strategy, coupled with continued high levels of aftermarket and MRO activity that we captured around the world despite the lack of a major project award. We did obtain a significant number of smaller awards in the $5 million to $10 million range which together totaled roughly $100 million across all industries and regions. Our largest project award was only $9 million in the fourth quarter. We remain disciplined on our project pricing approach and margin expectations. While this strategy may result in some lost incremental awards, we are confident that we will ultimately create more value with this selective bidding approach. Our 3D bookings represented roughly 30% of our total awards during the quarter, where we saw particular strength with LNG, nuclear and water awards. While some of the larger projects we previously expected to be awarded during the fourth quarter were delayed, they remain viable and healthy opportunities for Flowserve in 2024. For full year 2023, our bookings were nearly $4.3 billion. Turning to our aftermarket business. Most of our customers facilities continue to operate with high utilization rates. While their focus remains on reliability, efficiency and emissions reductions, we are positioned well to capture the aftermarket and MRO business associated with this type of work. For the ninth consecutive quarter, we generated over $500 million in aftermarket bookings. For the full year, our aftermarket bookings were nearly $2.3 billion, which were up 5% year-over-year. More importantly, we see the elevated demand for our higher-margin quicker turn aftermarket offerings continuing into 2024. Our overall market outlook for 2024 is very encouraging given the project opportunities and aftermarket trends we are seeing today. We believe the themes of energy security and decarbonization will continue to drive global spending for years to come. At year-end, our total project funnel has increased 13% versus prior year enabling us to remain disciplined and selective in the new project work we pursue. Our oil and gas funnel is up 25% year-over-year, driven primarily by mid and downstream activity in the Middle East, where were we are well positioned to capitalize on the significant investment in the region. Furthermore, our energy transition project funnel also increased nearly 25% year-over-year driven by decarbonization activities in the pursuit of clean energy. We believe we can secure enhanced project bookings in 2024, given the visibility that we have in our forward funnel. Beyond projects, we anticipate our aftermarket and MRO business to remain at elevated levels and support our growth into 2024 and beyond. We continue to see healthy activity levels despite some of the softening consumer trends and economic uncertainty that are highly publicized. Additionally, we are seeing signs of stability in areas that were depressed in 2023 like European chemicals. Our global install base is incredibly large and we have further opportunity to improve our aftermarket capture rates as we go forward. Overall, we believe that our global network of quick response centers combined with our commitment to serve our customers with speed and high levels of service will allow us to grow our aftermarket franchise further in 2024. I will now turn the call over to Amy to address our fourth quarter and full year financial results in greater detail.Amy Schwetz: Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. Let me also start by saying how pleased I am with our fourth quarter results, which demonstrated continued operational momentum, disciplined cost management and strong cash generation. For the fourth quarter, we achieved our best quarterly sales level since 2015, an adjusted operating margin of 10.5%, our highest quarter of the year and $0.68 of adjusted earnings per share. Our operating cash flow was also strong at $195 million in the quarter, representing a year-over-year improvement of $125 million. These results continued our recent trend of sequential quarterly improvement across many areas, which led to our outstanding full year 2023 results. Starting with other details in the quarter. Our reported earnings per share were $0.47, which included $0.21 of net adjusted expenses, primarily below the line FX impacts and realignment charges. Improved operating performance drove a 12% increase in revenues over prior year, comprised of FPDs and FCDs growth of 13% and 11%, respectively. We also generated strong top line growth in both original equipment and aftermarket, with revenue increases of 15% and 9%, respectively. Many of our regions contributed to the double-digit sales growth as well, with notable year-over-year improvement in the Middle East and Africa, North America and Europe, of 27%, 14% and 13% respectively. Shifting to margins. We generated adjusted gross margins of 29.8% during the quarter, a 100 basis point increase compared to the prior years fourth quarter despite higher performance-based compensation expense and the modest mix shift to original equipment. The margin improvement was driven by increased sales leverage, benefits from our new operating model and continued traction with operational excellence initiatives and an improving supply chain environment. At a segment level, we are particularly pleased to see FCD realize its highest quarterly adjusted gross margins since 2019. At 32.2%, representing a 310 basis point year-over-year improvement. On a reported basis, fourth quarter consolidated gross margins increased 70 basis points to 29.1%. Despite the net increase in realignment and asset write-downs of $4.1 million, versus prior year. Fourth quarter adjusted SG&A increased $39 million to $230 million compared to last year. The increase was primarily due to $13 million in higher year-over-year performance-based incentive compensation and an increase in bad debt of $6 million as well as some benefits in 2022 that did not recur this year, such as the $9 million legal settlement and a small gain on an asset sale of $4 million. Despite these somewhat discrete items, adjusted SG&A as a percent of sales was 19.7%, driven by solid operating leverage during the quarter. On a reported basis, fourth quarter SG&A increased year-over-year by $41 million to $235 million. In addition to the items just mentioned, our reported amount also includes a net $2 million increase in adjusted items, primarily from realignment expenses. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 10.5%, just 30 basis points lower compared to prior year. While our adjusted gross margins this quarter were essentially equivalent to those of the 2023 third quarter, I am very pleased that the sequential adjusted operating margins expanded by 180 basis points for a nearly 40% sequential incremental. On a reported basis, fourth quarter operating margins decreased 70 basis points year-over-year to 9.4%. Due to higher performance-based incentive compensation, the onetime discrete SG&A items previously discussed and a $6 million increase in adjusted items compared to the prior year, again primarily related to the realignment actions. Our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate of 7.8% was notably lower than expected, primarily due to the release of valuation allowance on certain net foreign deferred tax assets. Our reported rate of 5.6% reflects the items just mentioned as well as the tax impact associated with realignment charges, which we excluded from our adjusted results. Turning to our full year results. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.10, a 91% increase year-over-year. The performance exceeded our latest revised guidance range from October of $1.95 to $2.05 and with nearly 30% above the midpoint of our initial 2023 target range we provided this time a year ago. Our full year 2023 revenues were over $4.3 billion, up nearly 20% compared to the prior year as our backlog conversion cadence significantly improved with our operational performance. On this sales level, we generated adjusted gross margins of 30.1% for the year, modestly exceeding our prior expectations. Importantly, we remain confident in our ability to expand margins further by accelerating our operational excellence initiatives and ongoing product management of our portfolio. Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales was 20.9% for the year, representing our lowest level since 2015. This performance was driven by our focus on cost containment, including the benefits from our recent cost-out program and organizational redesign as well as increasing top line leverage. While we are pleased with the progress we have made to date, we know that the work on this front is never done, and we will remain focused on driving even better results. Our full year adjusted operating margin was 9.5%, a meaningful increase of 330 basis points over the prior year. Both FCD and FPD delivered solid 2023 performance, keeping pace with significant increases in adjusted segment operating margin of roughly 320 and 330 basis points, respectively, to 14% and 12.4%. Looking ahead, we are well positioned towards our longer-term 2027 consolidated adjusted operating margin target of 14% to 16% that we shared at our Analyst Day in September. Our adjusted tax rate of 15.1% for the full year finished below our previous expectations, primarily driven by the release of valuation allowances on specific foreign net deferred tax assets as we believe those benefits will now be realized based on our improving financial results and help mitigate future cash taxes. Turning now to cash flow. We delivered outstanding full year operating cash flow of $326 million, which represented a nearly $366 million year-over-year improvement. In addition to our higher earnings, Im also very pleased that we improved cash from working capital by nearly $240 million, and our cash conversion cycle decreased by roughly 10 days compared to 2022. During the fourth quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $195 million, an increase of $125 million compared to the prior year. The improvement can largely be attributed to our strong working capital performance. Accounts receivable was a modest source of cash this quarter despite our increased revenues, but represented a $77 million improvement compared to the prior year. Collections results have been robust all year. But notably are evidenced by the nearly 7-day reduction in our day sales outstanding year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Inventory also contributed to working capital progress as weve reduced the cash used by over $50 million for both the fourth quarter and the full year compared to the respective periods of 2022. As a percent of sales, we improved our year-end primary working capital by approximately 450 basis points to 27.9% and improved sequentially by 260 basis points as well. We made great strides towards reducing our working capital and investment to our 25% to 27% long-term target and it will remain a major focus area for us going forward. Capital expenditures were $20 million during the quarter, bringing this years free cash flow to $175 million. This year-over-year improvement exceeds $100 million and resulted in a free cash flow to adjusted net income conversion of 194%. Other significant uses of cash in the fourth quarter included $26 million for dividends and a $10 million term loan reduction. Turning to our 2024 outlook. We expect to continue building on our operating momentum to deliver full year revenue growth of 4% to 6%, with adjusted earnings per share between $2.40 to $2.60, both consistent with the qualitative guidance we provided at our September Analyst Day. At the midpoint, our 2024 adjusted earnings guidance represents a roughly 20% increase over last year. As Scott mentioned, our markets continue to remain active, and we expect to generate a full year book-to-bill ratio over 1x, building backlog to spur multiyear revenue growth. We also expect net interest expense in the range of $60 million to $65 million and an adjusted tax rate of approximately 20%. Our adjusted targets exclude expected realignment expenses of approximately $30 million as well as other potential items that may occur during the year, such as below-the-line foreign currency effects and the impact of other discrete items. Including the potential realignment spending, we expect our reported EPS to be in the range of $2.25 to $2.45 per share. Similar to last year, we will work to minimize top line reduction as we move from the sequentially strong last quarter of the year to the first quarter. That said, we would anticipate our general trend of seasonality and earnings will continue in 2024, with the first quarter being our lowest earnings quarter of the year and the fourth quarter being the strongest. We intend to further drive value creation through our capital allocation approach. As we weigh opportunities to allocate capital, we are guided by our enduring framework to deploy excess cash to the highest long-term return while remaining impartial as to how value is created. Our Board has authorized a 5% increase to our dividend to $0.21 per share. Additionally, the Board also replenished our authorized share repurchase capacity to $300 million. As we indicated at the Analyst Day, we view share repurchases to offset equity compensation as a commitment and with the increased capacity of the new plan, we also can act opportunistically. That said, we believe there are ample opportunities to invest in the business, both through internal programs and inorganic growth. We expect capital expenditures between $75 million and $85 million this year, and we are well positioned to pursue M&A opportunities to further expand our portfolio of flow control offerings to better support and accelerate our 3D strategy. We are most interested in targets that provide the opportunity to leverage our scale and that can be effectively integrated with our broader business. Financial discipline and economic returns are table stakes. So the returns on any acquisition would be in excess of our average cost of capital as well as the margin and cash EPS accretive. Through it all, our capital allocation approach is designed to maintain our investment-grade rating, and we intend to reduce our term loan by $60 million this year. I am proud of the strong foundation we established during 2023 and feel confident that we can drive continued margin and earnings per share growth, while deploying capital to deliver long-term shareholder value as we progress towards our longer-term targets. I fully expect 2024 to be a great start on that journey. Let me now return the call to Scott.Scott Rowe: Great. Thank you, Amy. Let me now offer a few comments on our 3D strategy. which, as we discussed at our September Analyst Day, is directly aligned with the market environment that we see today and in the future. The strategy is intended to drive accelerated growth for years to come. While we are well suited to serve our customer base today, we are continuing to invest in product and service offerings, including through potential inorganic opportunities that further build our portfolio to support diverse markets in the new emerging sources of energy. Let me start with Diversified where our bookings remain very healthy in 2023 as we continue to apply our portfolio into served end markets that present an above-average growth profile. Our vacuum pump products are a great example of our efforts and represent a significant component of the diversification pillar. Our focus to grow our vacuum products in general industrial applications has delivered outsized growth over the last several years. In the fourth quarter, we were selected to supply dry vacuum pumps for a state-of-the-art marine solvents production facility in Europe that will support the circular economy. The site will convert biomass waste into 1,000 metric tons of non-toxic solvents annually to be utilized in pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, electronics and other applications. Moving to decarbonize. We produced another quarter of strong bookings led by nuclear and LNG awards. We remain excited about the nuclear outlook as countries around the globe are focused on providing clean and reliable energy within their borders. We continue to be very optimistic on the nuclear outlook as countries begin to develop investment plans that have nuclear energy output tripling by 2050. Our strong portfolio of nuclear pumps, valves and seals are well positioned to meet this growing demand, including life extensions on existing assets and the building of new nuclear power facilities in Asia and Europe. New energy applications are another key driver behind our decarbonized initiative. Flowserve was recently selected to supply our specialty ball valves to support the production of liquid green hydrogen in the United States. This project is expected to produce nearly 11,000 tons of hydrogen to enable operations for one of the worlds largest e-commerce companies. Lastly, on digitize. We believe our ability to digitize our solutions and leverage our large installed base and aftermarket capabilities will enable Flowserve to be better equipped to provide true solutions for our customers. We believe our offering is at an inflection point of growth, and we have significant visibility to new installations. We now have over 80 customer locations using Red Raven (NASDAQ:RAVN) technology with almost 2,100 assets instrumented. We remain committed to adding value to our customers with this digital offering by instrumenting pumps and valves to monitor, predict and ultimately better optimize the full flow loop. Flowserve have recently partnered with three European-based petrochemical facilities to increase reliability and efficiency with our Red Raven technology. We are pleased to continue expanding our IoT presence in petrochemicals, an industry where we are seeing an increasing level of acceptance, providing us with an opportunity to offer more of our solutions portfolio and capabilities to help solve our customers toughest flow control challenges. In conclusion, Im extremely pleased with our progress in 2023. The new organization design is driving enhanced execution, improved accountability and is allowing us to operate with speed. This new design better supports our 3D strategy and will allow Flowserve to further our advantage in securing the market opportunities in front of us. Im confident in our ability to maintain the momentum created in 2023 and continue driving improvements in 2024 and beyond. The trajectory to our longer-term financial goals outlined at our Analyst Day begins with the delivery of our 2024 targets, including 4% to 6% revenue growth, more than 100 basis points adjusted operating margin improvement and roughly 20% adjusted EPS growth at the midpoint of our guidance. Finally, I am pleased that our efforts and strategy continue to be recognized by third-party organizations. In recent weeks, Flowserve was named by the Newsweek as one of Americas most responsible companies and we are named in Forbes list of most successful mid-cap companies in 2024. The financial and operational performance we delivered last year creates a solid foundation to build upon, and I am excited about the opportunities for Flowserve in 2024. We have substantially improved our ability to execute and serve our customers, and Im confident that this progress will carry into 2024 as we expect to deliver another significant year of improved financial results. We are fully focused this year on profitably converting our near-record $2.7 billion backlog, continuing our pursuit of outsized growth driven by our 3D strategy, and driving higher operating margins through further operational improvements. We remain committed to driving long-term value for our associates, customers and shareholders. Operator, this concludes our prepared remarks and we would now like to open the call to questions.Nathan Jones: Im going to start with the questions on the bookings outlook. I think, Amy, in your prepared remarks, you talked about a book-to-bill above 1. Scott, you talked about growth in the pipeline. I think the book-to-bill above 1 kind of implies mid to high single-digit bookings growth. So  just any more color you can give us on how that splits out between projects and aftermarket? What kind of projects are in the pipeline and the confidence that those will convert to orders this year?Scott Rowe: Sure. Yes. Its a really good question, Nathan. Let me start with aftermarket and then Ill go to kind of traditional end markets, and Ill touch on projects as well. On the aftermarket side, we saw tremendous growth in 2023. We delivered about 5% for the full Flowserve and we expect that to continue. And so when we look at utilization rates and we look at kind of whats happening with the customer installations, we see that, that aftermarket work will continue as we go forward. And then secondly, we believe theres an ability to drive our capture rate up. Were  we dont disclose what that rate is. But what Ill say is we know we have opportunities to do better there. And in the Analyst Day, we outlined some of those opportunities, both on the pump side and the valve side. And so we believe weve got kind of market share or capture rate opportunities on top of what well say is a very constructive environment for our aftermarket business. So we see something similar to 2023 in terms of growing that side of the business. And then like the Analyst Day or within the Analyst Day, we talked about our traditional end markets, and we showed kind of some like more GDP-type results at this 3% to 5% growth for those end markets. And again, when we look at our model, nothing has changed there. And so we see reasonably good growth on the traditional end markets across the board. And then where we see really exciting growth is in the new energy and the decarbonization side. And so thats where we see that outsized growth above that kind of 3% to 5%. And we had a really good year in 2023 across all aspects of our business in terms of bookings growth with the exception of large projects. And so when we look at our project funnel, what we see is the project funnel overall is up 13%. Our oil and gas funnel is up 25%, and that decarbonization of new energy is up 25%. And so that gives us a lot of confidence on our project outlook and making sure that we can acquire and win awards that makes sense on our margins and value creation. And so Id say, overall, we feel really good about where we are in terms of the overall market and the outlook. And I think we can  at this point, we believe that we can deliver certainly above 1.0 on our book-to-bill and drive to that 5% growth target that we put out in the Analyst Day.Nathan Jones: One follow-up on orders and specifically, the oil and gas pipeline being up 25%. Thats obviously still your biggest end market. And so thats 1 that could move the needle. And probably where the large projects are as well. Does this above 1.0 include the conversion of any large projects? Or would those be kind of gravy on top and whats your confidence that they actually get awarded in 24.Scott Rowe: Yes. The project market in oil and gas has stacked up pretty substantially. Its primarily delivered  or primarily in the Middle East. And I was there 3 weeks ago  and quite frankly, I was overwhelmed with the amount of work thats out there and the spending thats happening. Now obviously, things could change that  but I would say with Saudis 2030 vision with what we see in the rest of the region across countries like the UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, the activity is substantial. And so to your question directly, theres a long list of large projects out there. If we get two or three of those, that would be gravy to compare to what were talking about, but I would say there are a couple of those projects that are kind of more moderate size that are embedded in our growth projections. But again, we feel good about it. Weve been very selective, specifically in 2023 in terms of what we want to win. Weve been very disciplined in that approach. And I feel really good that were going to start to win some work, but when work that makes sense from a margin perspective and value creation perspective.Mike Halloran: Maybe we just follow-up on the comment you just made there. Certainly, understand the diligence behind project selection and where you want to win and focus on the margins. But when you take a step back, how would you describe the overall competitive landscape right now, given the amount of opportunity out there, you see a little bit more diligence from some of the competitor base or just a little bit more logical pricing mechanisms? Or is it still pretty project by project? Any thought on that side?Scott Rowe: Sure. If we compare it to  lets go to 2 years ago when folks were very, very hungry for work. The environment is substantially better than that. But what Ill say is the project environment is always attractive. Everybody wants to bid and participate in it. And so it remains somewhat challenging. And so through our selected bidding approach, what were looking at is customers we know we can work with, customers where we know that we can deliver the margin expectations that we signed up for in the bidding phase. And then were also looking for making sure that we can get the aftermarket associated with the work there. And so I think thats probably the biggest change for us is really getting a more holistic look at what we wanted to work or what we want to work on geographically, but then also with the customers in supporting that aftermarket. And then when we think about the competitive landscape, everybody is substantially fuller in terms of capacity than what we saw 2 years ago. We are seeing discipline improve pretty substantially, but every now and then, well get a surprise by somebody that doesnt kind of stay in that disciplined approach. And well just accept that and move on and make sure that we can win work thats more suitable to the margin expectations that we deserve.Mike Halloran: Great. Makes sense. And then good to see the cash generation this quarter. Could you maybe talk to the 24 expectations that layer it as well usage of that cash, the buyback authorization [indiscernible] certainly here in these remarks around it. Is there any more intent there to be opportunistic? And how do you see the M&A landscape with the cash generation?Amy Schwetz: Sure. So Id start with our expectations continue to continue to generate nice levels of cash as we move into 2024. At the Analyst Day, we talked about kind of a guiding principal between 80% and 100% free cash flow conversion, I think well be at the low end or slightly below that in 2024, just given some of the realignment activities that we expect to continue to occur. In terms of capital allocation, I think that what we wanted to do with this most recent action with the Board is to really just increase the opportunity set that we have out there modest dividend increase, acknowledging that we had not had an increase in our dividend level since early in 2020. And then again, at the Analyst Day, we had recommitted to the practice of share buybacks to offset equity dilution. Weve not done that in the last couple of years. So we want the opportunity to be able to do that. So thats probably a little bit of catch-up this year. I will say, overall, I think that our bias, which needs to be tested each time we have the opportunity is to invest those dollars either in internal growth or inorganic growth to boost really our top line, find opportunities that are accretive to margins and EPS and ultimately grow earnings for our shareholders. But I think that with the actions the Board took this year, we have an opportunity to have a full suite of options available to us as we make our way into 2024.Sabrina Abrams: So, some of your competitors have talked about seeing 100 bps to 200 bps of better margin backlog relative to whats shipping through the P&L today. Is that a fair framework for what Flowserve is shipping in 2024 relative to its P&L?Amy Schwetz: I would say we definitely see improvement in the pricing of our backlog, and some of that is obviously dependent on mix that you currently have in our backlog. But I think that we see that margin in backlog as a real tailwind for us going into 2024.Sabrina Abrams: Got it. And as a follow-up, I guess I am thinking about the different components of the margins. So, you have better pricing in the backlog. There is the mix benefit from aftermarket outgrowing OE and some incremental benefit from the restructuring program. So, if you could talk about maybe the different components, the good guys and bad guys and the margin bridge for 2024. Just want to understand the components of the 100 bps of expansion that you guys are guiding to?Amy Schwetz: Sure. So, I will start by saying we are confident in our ability to expand margins by the 100 basis points or more. And as we think about our guidance range, I would say our ability to move towards the high end of that range would likely mean margin expansion above that 100 basis points versus volume growth, given that we saw sales volume growth of nearly 20% in 2023. So, where we are at in terms of puts and takes, neutral from a  to a slightly positive on price-cost from a material inflation standpoint, and you have already touched on the margin in backlog, which we see as a positive. And we do have the structural cost savings from both the org redesign that we put in place and the activities that are taking shape with respect to op excellence. In terms of whats working against us in 2024, I would start with labor inflation is something that will begin to take hold kind of late in the first quarter and really start to show up in the second quarter of the year. And then although we do have a nice backlog of aftermarket mix, I think the mix of project work is going to be something that we will be monitoring and watching closely in terms of margin expectations in 2024. And I would start with what Scott has described as a large funnel of FPD large project work that we will have available for us in 2024. And although those will be at margins better than what we saw  than what we saw kind of 18 months, 24 months, 36 months ago, and those are still lower than our aftermarket more run rate work. And secondarily, on the FCD slide, that backlog is actually right now skewed more towards project work or OE work than aftermarket. That backlog is about 300 basis points more OE this year at this time than it was last year. So, thats the other piece of project mix that we are looking at.Joe Giordano: Hey. On LNG, obviously, a lot going on with what the President has been saying about LNG export and things like that. Is that globally fungible to you guys? Like do you care where terminals are built? Like if we do less here, or is it just going to have to be somewhere else and you will be there?Scott Rowe: Yes. I would say our LNG work is more outside of the U.S. than in the U.S. And so we have got substantial bookings and opportunities in the Middle East. We have got some work on the books for Latin America, Africa. We have got a round two in Canada that we expect. And so I think we still feel good about the outlook of LNG. I wont get into the politics of this, but we think natural gas is an incredible transition source of energy, and we believe its going to be a part of the mix for a long time to come. I think the U.S. exporting permit hold will potentially have an impact on our kind of 2025 business, but 2024 work in the U.S. has already been funded and already been approved. And so it wont have an impact on what we see in 2024. And we will continue to migrate more of our products and services into cryogenic applications to support LNG because we are big believers in this over the next 10 years to 15 years.Joe Giordano: Just on that point on cryo, obviously, the land acquisition didnt work out. You bought technology  you bought R&D from Chart  like where are you with cryo kind of pumping applications? Is there more you need to do maybe an update there? And kind of related to that is, on your 3D, is there like fundamentally  are margins basically the same there as in more established markets for you guys now, or is that a gap you still need to be closed? Thanks.Scott Rowe: Yes. I will answer that one first because its easy. The 3D and certainly, the energy transition margin expectations are basically in line with the rest of the portfolio. And then back to cryogenic applications, I would say the bow portfolio is more rounded out than the pumps at this point. And so we have got control valves. We have isolation valves that can all do cryogenic, both LNG and hydrogen. There are opportunities, though, to grow that pretty substantially. And what we liked about Velan is they were better positioned with some of their technology and products than we were. And so continued M&A work on expanding that cryogenic portfolio in valves will continue to happen in 2024 and beyond. And then on the pumps side, we have got kind of two things. The acquisition that we did with Chart was really around hydrogen distribution, but we can take that technology and know-how and imply it into LNG and cryogenic applications. And so we are in the very late stages of developing a full cryogenic pump offering. And that, what we really like about that is it can be used for liquefaction transportation and into the re-gas application. And so by the  certainly, by kind of mid-year, late year, we will have a full kind of cryogenic pumping solution that will serve  that can be potentially used in  what we used in LNG but potentially used in hydrogen as well.Deane Dray: I would like to circle back on the comments regarding the mix of bookings this quarter, really interesting that no big orders, which kind of gives you a strong sense of the underlying demand that you are seeing, but I would love to hear some commentary. You called out both some project delays as well as selectivity. Can you just kind of give us directionally how much of an impact were the delays versus selectivity. And then maybe just  I dont know if there is any other factors that would have kept the larger orders to a minimum this quarter, but just size for us, the impact of it.Scott Rowe: Yes. So, in Q4, we had visibility to, lets call it, two or three awards, more on the pump side than the valve side, that did get delayed. And some of that was delayed into Q1 and some of it is going to be delayed probably the back half of the year. And as you know, you followed our business a long time. There is lots of reasons for delays. Project timing is incredibly hard to predict. But what I would say is those opportunities did not get canceled. They didnt get turned off. They might be slightly smaller, a little bit different than what we anticipated, but we are confident that they go forward in 2024. We are also confident given the selectivity that those will deliver the margins that we deserve as we go forward. And then I would just say on the selectivity side and turning things off, I think that was a trend predominantly throughout the whole year. There wasnt something major that we kind of missed out on in Q4. Its more about just putting the right resources upfront and doing the work thats required to prepare for these large tenders. And so when something comes out, its we are pulling the entire team. There is usually anywhere from 10 to 30 people that are working on these. And we have just been really selective at the front end and directing our resources to things that we think make more sense economically and can support that customer through the life cycle of their asset. So, I would say the Q4 was probably more a little bit of slip out than being selective, but again, we feel really good about what we are seeing in 2024 on the projects.Deane Dray: Thats great color. And just whats the balancing act that you have to do when the higher you ratchet up selectivity, then the downside is you missed kind of building the installed base and your ability to capture aftermarket. And look, the winners curse on these bigger deals is that there is margin pressure. So, there is a balancing act, but maybe you can just share with us some of the mechanics.Scott Rowe: It is a delicate balancing act Deane. And I will just say, between Amy and myself and Lamar Duhon, leads our Pumps division, thats probably the single biggest topic that we have with him and his team. And its not easy because we do know when you get the installed base, its pulling our seal business through, its pulling parts through, its pulling service through. And so we are actively pursuing installed base. At the same time, we are now modeling that out and looking at it on a returns basis. And so we can more accurately predict, like is that customer going to give us the aftermarket, or do they go out and bid some of that aftermarket. And so we can kind of model in what that probability of success looks like on the aftermarket and make much better decisions about where we will populate the installed base and where we wont. And so I would say we have improved dramatically in the last year about what we should pursue and where we shouldnt, but continuing to have a robust installed base and continuing to drive aftermarket support is important. And then the other thing I would say is we are also now with our aftermarket franchise and some of our business processes there that continue to improve on speed in winning, we are starting to win aftermarket work for third-party equipment. And so thats something we steered away from probably 4 years or 5 years ago. We are not openly going out and targeting our competitive aftermarket. But with our presence there, with our ability to drive speed and serve our customers in a timely manner, we are starting to see more and more work on stuff thats not necessarily our original equipment.Amy Schwetz: And I might just put an exclamation point on that from a portfolio perspective because we have committed to the long-term targets in terms of both revenue growth and margin expansion. And what we are trying to do is expand our installed base within the constraints as those  as that margin expansion and volume growth paradigm. So, I think as Scott pointed out, we are in a better position than we have ever been to do that. But as you can imagine, as a finance person, I absolutely love the aftermarket capture rate strategy and trying to be more aggressive about going after that higher margin business.Deane Dray: Alright. I appreciate all that insight. And just one other question, and its for Amy, thats really impressive free cash flow this quarter. Just where do you stand now on the whole releasing of buffer inventory? You gave lots of specifics about how much of each of the components of working capital improved, I would be interested in hearing a bit more about what we are seeing on these releases of buffer inventory now with the supply chain is normalizing. So, how much more do you have to go there? Thanks.Amy Schwetz: Yes. So, I will start. I think that 2024 from a working capital perspective was a journey. We saw collections throughout 2024 or 2023, excuse me, be quite strong. We were pleased with the way the organization collaborated with that to make sure that we got those where we wanted them to be. And really, the third quarter and the fourth quarter we had an opportunity to set ourselves up for inventory reduction by the end of the year, and that was partially sales volume, partially our planning processes getting better. If I were to put this in baseball terms, I think we are still in the, call it, the fourth innings of inventory reduction. I think we can continue to get smarter with that and our improvement of planning processes is really playing a key role in that. I think we are going to continue to make progress on that within 2024, but we have made it clear to the organization that we have also committed to growth. And so we have to be very smart about how we reduce that inventory over time and where and how we do that. So, I feel like we are striking the right balance, but we are going to march methodically towards that 25% to 27% working capital target.Unidentified Analyst: Hi there. Well, this is James on for Saree. Thanks for taking questions. So, I just wanted to kind of go back on the margins in the backlogs. So, I think you said the margins are coming at higher levels. But I think you said the orders are still not at the 2019 margin levels. So, where does that stand now? And what is the missing gap here since the demand seems strong. Thank you.Amy Schwetz: Yes. So, I would probably stop short of saying that we are not at 2019 margin levels yet in backlog. I think along the way, we are making progress from an operational excellence standpoint. We are working smarter at our facilities. And frankly, we are playing in different markets than we did in 2019 as we look at the growth of those 3D and energy transition markets. So, I certainly think that the margins in backlog today are a tailwind for us going into 2024. But we are going to continue to do the things that we need to do to improve that as we convert backlog into revenue. And thats really around making the most of these structural cost savings that we have in place and embedding operational excellence into each and every one of our facilities and processes. And then really ramping up our activities with respect to product management and using that as a lever, I think that becomes a lever more in the back half of 2024 than it is in the front half, but I expect that to be an area that we continue to progress and build momentum as we make our way through the year.Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks for the color. And I kind of wanted to ask on the FCD. I think the margins here expanded nicely and kind of reached the long-term target of the segment. So, can you kind of talk about the drivers here, kind of add more color here? And how should we think about the margin for FCD going into 2024? Thank you.Amy Schwetz: Yes. FCD has been a great story from a margin expansion standpoint in 2023. And how they ended the year was actually right in line with what our expectations were for them in 2023. I think as we move into 2024, we will see that moderate a bit with volume in the first quarter of the year and continue to make their way up sequentially again. The real headwind that FCD is going to have in 2024 is around mix. And in that they are now more focused in their backlog towards project versus aftermarket. There is about a 300 basis point shift there in terms of the makeup of backlog. So, that aftermarket strength we talk about in mix is really occurring on the FPD side. So, I would imagine that initially during 2024, we will see that margin expansion more on the FPD side than on FCD.Scott Rowe: Yes. And I would just add overall on margins. We had communicated earlier in the year that we were striving to get to 30% gross margins for the portfolio. We did that a little bit earlier than we expected. And so we feel really good about that margin trajection as we go forward. And as Amy said, its going to come more on the pumps side in 2024 than on the FCD side, but we still see nice progression forward and very much on the trajectory alignment towards our 2027 goals.We encourage you to use comments to engage with other users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other.

Kenya targets to begin the construction of its first nuclear power plant in 2027. This is even as the country seeks to further diversify its energy generation amid rising demand and push for zero-carbon energy.It is now emerging that the country is ready to fully adopt nuclear applications as it gears up to operationalise its first nuclear power plant by 2035. A site has already been identified along the Coastal belt and feasibility studies are underway.At the recently concluded COP28, Nuclear Regulatory Authority (KNRA) officials said that with robust regulation, capacity building and borrowing of best practices from partners like the International Atomic Energy Agency and the US Nuclear Energy Commission, Kenya was all set to go nuclear.KNRA Director for Partnerships and Public Awareness Edward Mayaka noted the commitments given by governments, industry, civil organisations, and other stakeholders, saying contrary to popular opinion, nuclear is a safe bet in environmental protection.Nuclear energy offers several advantages in the context of addressing climate change. Unlike fossil fuels, nuclear power plants generate electricity through a process that produces virtually no direct carbon emissions. This characteristic alone makes nuclear energy an attractive option for countries striving to reduce their carbon footprint, said Mr Mayaka.Besides KNRAs regulatory role of protecting lives and the environment from harmful effects of nuclear and radiation, the authority hosts the chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear risk mitigation center at its national laboratory in Oloolua, Kajiado County, serving eastern Africa.In the past, three nuclear accidents have influenced the discontinuation of nuclear power: the 1979 Three Mile Island partial nuclear meltdown in the United States, the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Russia, and the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan.Due to these incidences, several countries have initiated a nuclear power phase-out, citing safety concerns. But in recent times, several countries formerly opposed to opening nuclear programmes or planning phase-outs have reversed course due to climate concerns and energy independence.As of 2021, Japan planned to restart 30 reactors by 2030. Also, according to research, the impacts of the nuclear shut-downs on the power generation mix have significantly set back emissions reduction goals in these countries.A recent study of the impacts of the German and Japanese phase-outs concludes that by continuing to operate their nuclear plants, "these two countries could have prevented 28,000 air pollution-induced deaths and 2,400 Metric tonnesof CO2 emissions between 2011 and 2017.Theres renewed interest in nuclear. We recently launched a postgraduate course in nuclear and radiation safety, which will go a long way in building Kenyas and Africas capacity to go nuclear, he said.The KNRA officials urged nuclear skeptics to embrace it, saying nuclear power plants have a cost advantage besides a remarkable track record of reliability and stability. They provide a steady source of electricity, which can be critical for countries looking to build resilient energy infrastructures capable of withstanding impacts of climate change, he said.According to the International Energy Agency, the global renewable energy supply from solar, wind, hydro, geothermal and ocean rose last year by eight per cent, meaning that the share of these technologies in total global energy supply rose by 0.4 per cent points to 5.5 per cent. Most countries, especially in the Global South, rely on hydroelectric power without diversifying electricity sources.
Ive never been a Reddit user myself, but Im at least familiar with famous subreddits like r/Showerthoughts, where users have mini epiphanies or ask other netizens questions theyve been pondering about. Recently, Ive had a recurring shower thought of my own: why dont things that are alive, like the human body, go bad? We refrigerate food to keep it safe to eat, and we cook it to a temperature that kills germs. But our bodies, and those of most animals and plants living around the world, are definitely in the infamous food safety Danger Zone: 40140 degrees Fahrenheit. And animals like humans are full of almost comically high levels of many kinds of bacteria. Whats stopping us from becoming toxic, like cookie dough left at room temperature?I know what youre thinking. The bodys natural processes arent what would cause it to go bad or not, like old leftovers in the fridge. But these processes do remove the material chemical waste products made by bodily visitors like bacteria, as well as living and dead viruses and other disease-causing invaders. In a typical healthy persons body, everything that leaves the body must do so through one of these natural pathways, so they necessarily play a role.And to kill those germs in the first place, we have the immune system. As an example, a respiratory virus is repelled in multiple stages. The typical flu virus is 100+ times larger than an atom, while bacteria are ten times larger still. Our mouths and noses allow us to breathe in what we wanttiny oxygen molecules and other similarly sized particles that are part of regular airwhile physically obstructing some of the chunky bits like viruses, bacteria, and pollen. Then inside the body, the immune system finds, flags, and destroys invaders.That immune defense system is, it turns out, the bulk of the answer to my question. When we cook foods to a safe temperature, or keep them refrigerated, were building a defense system using temperature as a barrier: fewer germs can find and settle in food that is at one temperature extreme or the other. And in the body, where those temperature barriers are not an option if we want to keep being alive, our germs are fought off in realtime by roaming cells and coordinated mechanisms like inflammation. Inflammation opens a superhighway for immune cells to speed in and start picking off germs one by one.And while the immune system may be the most directly responsible defense, it cant work by itself. Everything else, from our electrolyte balance to the mitochondria, plays a part in supporting the entire body so that the immune cells can work effectively. One frightening example of this is necrosis, which is when body tissues die. For people with diabetes, which can inflame and restrict blood vessels and cause circulatory problems, theres often a higher risk of necrosis.But why do cells need blood flow in the first place? How does the flow of blood keep our tissues alive, and the restriction of blood cause them to wither? This goes back to the mitochondria. Body cells need oxygen in order to produce the energy used by the mitochondria, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This is called cellular respiration, and while Ive focused on the human body in this piece, animals as well as plants rely on cellular respiration. In this chemical reaction, cells take oxygen molecules and break them up to use them in other configurations. Blood also brings fresh fluid that can replenish tissue dehydration can cause cells to die.In asking myself how the human body doesnt go bad, I was engaging in some flawed high-level thinking, because the body is not homogeneous. We think of the body and the self in terms of one discrete person at a time, but the coordinated actions of trillions of cells, and the trillions of good bacteria that live in symbiosis with the human body, are constantly peeling the fingertips of invasive germs and disease off the ramparts. The reason living things dont go bad is that theyre filled to the brim with defenses. We continue to live by staving off the mechanisms of death.Caroline Delbert is a writer, avid reader, and contributing editor at Pop Mech. She's also an enthusiast of just about everything.

A new tech ideology is ascendant online. Introducing effective accelerationism, the pseudonymous user Beff Jezos tweeted, rather grandly, in May 2022. E/acc  pronounced ee-ack  is a direct product [of the] tech Twitter schizosphere, he wrote. We hope you join us in this new endeavour.The reaction from Jezoss peers was a mix of positive, critical, and perplexed. What the f*** is e/acc, posted multiple users. Accelerationism is unfortunately now just a buzzword, sighed political scientist Samo Burja, referring to a related concept popularized around 2017. I guess unavoidable for Twitter subcultures? These [people] are absolutely bonkers, grumbled Timnit Gebru, an artificial intelligence researcher and activist who frequently criticizes the tech industry. Their fanaticism + god complex is exhausting.Despite the criticism, e/acc persists, and is growing, in the tech hive mind. E/accs founders believe that the tech world has become captive to a monoculture. If it becomes paralyzed by a fear of the future, it will never produce meaningful benefits. Instead, e/acc encourages more ideas, more growth, more competition, more action. Whether youre building a family, a startup, a spaceship, a robot, or better energy policy, just build, writes one anonymous poster. Do something hard. Do it for everyone who comes next. Thats it. Existence will take care of the rest.Jezos admits that his initial announcement was a bit of a shitpost. And e/accs perceived lack of clarity  what, exactly, are they advocating for?  makes it tempting to dismiss it. Nevertheless, it has since caught the attention of a growing number of tech figures: venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, YCombinator president Garry Tan, Notion co-founder Chris Prucha, Intercom co-founder Ciaran Lee, and science investor and former U.S. state official Jim ONeill, some of whom add e/acc to their online display names and bios as a sign of solidarity.If e/acc isnt entirely sure yet what it is for, it does know what its against. One of its chief adversaries is AI safety, a field concerned with the risks of developing AI too quickly. Another, closely related, adversary is effective altruism, a utilitarian movement that aims to do the most good in the world. Even e/accs name is a jab against EA. Whereas AI safetyists follow the precautionary principle in their thinking about AI  emphasizing risk avoidance over action  effective accelerationists preach blazing forward into the unknown, arguing that we will only learn by doing.But these debates dont explain why e/acc became suddenly popular among a wider set of technologists, many of whom arent involved with artificial intelligence. E/accs significance lies in its counterbalancing force not just to AI safety, but to widespread public concerns about the risks posed by the tech industry at large. Effective accelerationists worry that these concerns have become so entrenched that they threaten to extinguish the light of tech itself.In March 2023, the Future of Life Institute published an open letter calling for artificial intelligence labs, such as OpenAI and Google AI, to immediately pause the development of technology more powerful than GPT-4 for at least six months. If such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, the letter stated, governments should step in and institute a moratorium. The letter also called for new systems of auditing, certification, monitoring, and regulation as AI develops.The letter was initially signed by over a thousand people, many of whom were not just concerned citizens but AI technologists themselves, including Yoshua Bengio, a pioneer of artificial intelligence research; Elon Musk, one of OpenAIs original co-founders (though he has not been involved since 2018); and Emad Mostaque, founder of Stability AI. Another statement, warning of the risk of extinction from AI, was published by the Center for AI Safety in May. It was signed by AI leaders at OpenAI, Anthropic, and DeepMind, as well as senior executives from Google and Microsoft.Artificial intelligence is a rare domain where technologists themselves are being proactively cautious about their own power before any demonstrable harm has been done. The moral panic now comes from within  a stark deviation from how technological revolutions historically influence society, as scholar Carlota Perez documents in her seminal 2002 book Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital.Perez looked at major technological innovations in the industrial age  including steam and railway, steel and electricity, oil and automobiles, and digital communication  and noticed that they follow a pattern. There is the initial big bang event that signifies a major technical breakthrough, which goes largely unnoticed at the time. Technologists, however, recognize its potential and build upon this breakthrough for decades, until it attracts wider adoption and interest. Financial capital then takes over from technologists to continue driving its development, which creates a speculative public frenzy, a financial bubble, and collapse, followed by a period of reflection and reconciliation as the technology is finally stabilized and absorbed into our social norms.While Perez suggests that this cycle occurs roughly every fifty years, if we squint a bit, we can see it play out with several more-recent technological breakthroughs, such as cloud computing and smartphones  which together drove the Web 2.0 startup boom  and cryptocurrency. In each case, technologists are generally advocates, not detractors, of the opportunities they see before the rest of the world catches on.Even when financial capital is not so involved, technologists have historically been fiercely protective of their right to build and distribute their work. Open-source programmers in the late 1990s and early 2000s were adamant that we should not restrict how their free and public code could be used, nor hold programmers liable for users decisions. Cryptographic code was once considered a form of munitions in the United States, subject to tightly controlled export laws; it was technologists who advocated for the right to share this code across national borders. When it comes to artificial intelligence, on the other hand, some technologists are skipping ahead to reflecting on its harms before the impact is clear.Its not that tech has never had a community concerned about the risks and ethics of artificial intelligence; they just werent the ones driving its development. AI safety has been a cottage research field for decades, championed by rationalists  an Internet community that prioritizes logical thought and eliminating cognitive bias  and effective altruists. The Machine Intelligence Research Institute, co-founded by AI researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky, began focusing on these risks in 2005. Overcoming Bias, a blog started by Yudkowsky and economist Robin Hanson the following year, was the predecessor to the forum LessWrong, which became a watering hole for people concerned about AIs impact on society.Such efforts were widely recognized and even supported by those in tech, but seemingly more from a place of symbolic goodwill  the way a prominent financier might support the arts  than serious engagement. AI safety research, and its underlying rationalist community, was a comforting reminder to wealthy entrepreneurs that tech was not just a shallow way to make money through startups, but a thoughtful, intellectual place with its own philosophical culture.Since late 2022, however, when the explosive success of OpenAIs ChatGPT made the potential of artificial intelligence suddenly visible to the public, what was once a niche subculture became an unlikely public face of the controversy over AI development. Parties previously unaffiliated with the AI safetyists suddenly became their bedfellows, such as Tristan Harris, a former Google employee and self-described tech ethicist who had made a name for himself by raising concerns about the harms of social media. These cautionary positions have now spread to a wider set of startup founders and engineers.For OpenAI and other large corporate labs, this position may be partly strategic: some onlookers grumble that these labs are working to achieve regulatory capture, courting favor with government. If nothing else, their leaders have likely learned from the wave of backlash against social media executives that its better to preemptively establish relationships with policymakers than to be brash. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, testified before the Senate last spring that we want to work with the government to prevent [problems] from happening.Among a wider set of technologists, the appeal of AI safety might reflect a cognitive tendency to overly formalize social problems. AIs risks are especially frightening for those who find comfort in predicting human behavior with math rather than lived experience. Calculating these risks and designing theoretical governance structures to avoid them is itself a form of nerd sniping, visible in other places among the likes of rationalists and crypto-governance enthusiasts.Or, perhaps, wanting to be regulated is a subconscious way for tech to reassure itself about its central importance in the world, which distracts from an otherwise uneasy lull in the industry. AI is the crown jewel of the tech industry at a time when the golden age of software startups has passed. Venture capital funding crashed from its frothy peak in 2022, marking a new and grueling era for startup founders. AI is a critical morale boost to rally techs spirits; being important enough to warrant regulatory action means its relevance wont fade anytime soon.Regardless of motivations, its this anomalous behavior of tech leaders to worry about their own work that effective accelerationists are reacting to. They find it strange and disheartening to see their fellow technologists so timid and docile in the face of a major new development.Instead, e/accs exhort their peers to pluck up and find the courage to embrace unfamiliar territory  a stance that is often interpreted by others as reckless. Grimes, the futuristic-chic musician who also traverses tech circles, cautioned e/accs founders to be more thoughtful about how they express themselves. You are freaking people out, she stated in a Twitter Space discussion last March. [Its] causing people to panic at non-profits and agitate for government regulation. I think thats the kind of thing you need to be careful about and mindful of. Powerful people are watching this.While effective accelerationists can be juvenile, letting their love of memes overshadow their substance, its founders, in their serious moments, dont advocate for willful ignorance of risks. Both Beff Jezos and Bayeslord, another pseudonymous founder, have repeatedly stated that they support efforts to align AI with human welfare  they just dont want fear to be the primary guide of technological innovation. From now on I dont want to see a single tweet about how e/acc doesnt want people to work on alignment, Bayeslord declared. On the contrary, we think reliability engineering is valuable work. However, we also want the apocalyptoids and the power hungry to lose.Effective accelerationists dont want us all to stop caring. Just the opposite: they wish that everyone cared more. They dont want to be known for bleating platitudes about a better future, then airily waving away the details. Rather, their moral vision is one where more people  including and especially those who consider themselves hands-off today  actively engage with emerging technology and identify concrete plans for its development and stewardship, rather than reflexively backing away from what they dont understand. Discussing the risks and opportunities in front of us intelligently, e/accs believe, is a sign of a flourishing civil society.E/accs nemesis is not the political left, with its proclivity toward regulation. One Twitter poll asking effective accelerationists how they self-identified politically  an informal poll, but perhaps a meaningful one, given how close-knit and online the movement is so far  was split roughly evenly between left and right. The previous culture war was between left and right, Jezos says. Now acceleration is the only option, degrowth is death.Rather than use well-trod political labels, e/acc wants to be the alternative to what they call decels, for decelerationists: proponents of a passive, overly cautious approach to the future. Back when disruption was a buzzword, tech was united against this timid mindset, which it saw as the default outsider position, of those trapped in their miserable 9-to-5 cubicle jobs who could only think in terms of red tape and bureaucracy. As effective accelerationists see it, in recent years the decel attitude has crept into tech itself, and nowhere more clearly than in debates about artificial intelligence.If decels had a face in tech, it would be Big Tech employees, the defanged, corporatized version of the hackers and outcasts who once inspired the tech industry, now imprisoned on motivational posters aimed at self-loathing managers. This, perhaps, is something that e/accs and some tech critics can agree upon: Settling for a middling Big Tech job  chasing lavish promotions instead of making history  represents a failure to realize the promises of tech and what it sought to accomplish, which those on the frontier now want to recapture.It was the tech backlash of the 2010s that tore a hole through techs image as it previously saw itself: a burgeoning industry composed of startups and their financiers, whose members would grind away writing code on their MacBooks and attending YCombinators demo days, whose hardest decision every year was whether to go to Burning Man. Though a founders life was filled with highs and lows, the cycle of tech seemed stable and predictable. Most importantly, tech was beloved by the outside world, who gleefully consumed stories of young founders and their mythical overnight successes.What went wrong? While tech believed it was changing the world for the better, PayPal co-founder and venture capitalist Peter Thiel warned in his 2014 book Zero to One that this era was marked by indefinite optimism. In contrast to the definite optimist, who not only articulates a vision for the future but plans and works to make it better, the indefinite optimist believes the future will be better, but he doesnt know how exactly. He expects to profit from the future but sees no reason to design it concretely.Published at the height of techs infatuation with startup disruption, Thiels comments proved to be several steps ahead of the rest of the tech industry. While Thiel generally approved of startups as a vehicle for definite optimists to realize their goals, he criticized the incrementalist attitude that he saw creeping into Silicon Valley. Founders from this era busily copied the methodology from Eric Riess 2011 book The Lean Startup that emphasized iterating upon customer feedback to find the right fit between product and market. They adopted YCombinators Make something people want motto as canon, and pitched their companies to investors within the familiar framework of Im building X for Y: eBay for space (Airbnb), Uber for trucking (Convoy) and so on. Thiel was skeptical of this trend. He challenged founders to build solutions based on what they wanted to happen, rather than hamfistedly plastering a layer of software onto every problem in sight.Silicon Valleys indefinite optimism was equally foreshadowed by Marc Andreessens 2011 article Why Software Is Eating the World. While the phrase is remembered as a prediction of how founders from this era would become enormously wealthy, it also captures how their success was due to riding the wave of digitization, rather than leading with definite optimism. Techs love of digital disruption became a running joke: whether health care, local business, or agriculture, it seemed every outmoded industry could be magically transformed by the pixie dust of software. The subsequent graveyard of startups from this period reveals a lack of understanding by founders of how these industries actually worked, and of the complex social and political forces that shape them.Beyond startups, techs sunny navet extended to its relationship to society, creating resentment. There was the story of Patrick McConlogue, a software programmer living in New York, who attracted ire in 2013 when he published a Medium post explaining that he had offered Leo, a homeless man, a choice between either $100 in cash or three JavaScript books and a laptop, as well as an hour of McConlogues time every day to teach him how to code. Leo chose the latter, and McConlogue kept his promise and taught him how to code. They even built a ridesharing app together. But two years later, Leo was still homeless, overwhelmed by the attention hed received, and no longer coding. Though McConlogues attempts were earnest, he had applied a one-size-fits-all solution and hoped for the best. When he did not succeed, there was no backup plan.It was techs indefinite optimism that prevented it from heeding the signs of discontent swirling about, clinging to the industry like San Franciscos fog. There were the rising rents; the commuter protests; the murmurs about how techs biggest accomplishments were creating a crisis of attention, loneliness, and political strife  all easily dismissed by tech workers, whose experience had taught them that even against long odds they could only ever win, until they hit a snag in the fall of 2016.The outcome of the U.S. presidential election not only shocked legislators, who set about searching for answers from tech companies they believed were partly to blame for Donald Trumps victory; it also marked the turnover of the Obama administration, which had enthusiastically supported techs optimism. The world had called techs bluff, and it turned out that behind the cheerful promises of a better future there was no real vision that would assuage the betrayal that many felt.Those in tech burrowed underground to lick their wounds. As the smoke cleared, they began having private conversations with trusted peers and friends. They struggled to reconcile the sudden surge of anger from outsiders with their own internal sense of self. Over the next few years, tech experienced a profound loss of identity, followed by a search for meaning.Founders and engineers are not typically known for their innate interest in non-technical topics like philosophy and history, but they turned now to these pursuits to make sense of their predicament. Snapchat founder and CEO Evan Spiegel, who had previously made headlines for a series of boorish emails he had sent as an undergraduate to his Stanford fraternity brothers, now stood in front of the French-American Foundation in 2017 and spoke about Alexis de Tocqueville, who, as Spiegel put it, believed that the newspaper was one of the most important tools for helping democracy overcome individualism.Ultimately, everyone in tech was trying to answer the same question, posed for millennia by those unlucky souls who find themselves suddenly in exile: How, now, shall we live? If the brash, unchecked ambition that had defined tech for decades was no longer something to be proud of, how should technologists find meaning in their work today?The varying answers to this question scattered tech workers into different factions. Many were alarmed and remorseful about the harm they had caused  to Americas social fabric, teenage mental health, and the future of the country. They now faced difficult questions from friends and family about the transgressions of their employers, and resolved to shepherd what they saw as a more responsible approach to technology, examining the effects of misinformation, algorithmic bias, and lack of content moderation. Tristan Harris, the ex-Google tech ethicist, became a vocal advocate for addressing the negative effects of social media, featuring prominently in the 2020 Netflix documentary The Social Dilemma.Others blamed the American managerial class, whose appendages were tangled in a secular monoculture that had lost its moral and spiritual purpose. They found solace in the philosophical writings of Nick Land and a pseudonymous blogger named Mencius Moldbug, who expounded upon the idea that progressive liberal democracy is becoming an all-powerful bureaucratic oligarchy, the solution to which is a return to monarchy and traditional values. This was the beginning of the neoreactionary movement, which grew into the New Right today, and whose members, and associated figures in tech like Peter Thiel, backed anti-establishment candidates like J.D.Vance and Blake Masters in the 2022 elections.Still others felt that the problem was that America no longer valued technological progress and innovation. They read economist Tyler Cowens 2011 book The Great Stagnation, which warned that the American economy had begun to plateau. In 2019, Cowen and Stripe co-founder Patrick Collison published an Atlantic article titled We Need a New Science of Progress, by which they meant a study of the combination of economic, technological, scientific, cultural, and organizational advancement that has transformed our lives and raised standards of living over the past couple of centuries. Their efforts fostered a movement, sometimes called progress studies or just progress, as well as its cousin movement abundance, whose proponents focus on removing institutional roadblocks to innovation  particularly through an economic and policy lens  such as the development of clean energy, building more housing and public works, and funding scientific research.Others saw poor governance of San Francisco  which had attracted media attention for its crime, dirtiness, and political infighting  as a sign of how tech had underutilized its influence, falling out of step with its environment. The San Francisco School Board and district attorney elections became hotly contested battles as tech workers organized to support candidates who aligned with their values. Garry Tan, the YCombinator president who grew up in a working-class Bay Area immigrant family, devoted himself to improving San Franciscos living conditions, organizing recall campaigns, and supporting the launch of GrowSF, a political action committee founded by tech workers that focuses on reducing homelessness and improving public safety and services.While each of these tribes has a different underlying philosophy and agenda, they are united by an embrace of definite, rather than indefinite, approaches. Instead of the incrementalist, software eating the world approach to disruption, these tech tribes are now focused on bringing about tangible, meaningful change. They also tend to have greater humility toward what they realize they dont know. They are more likely to consult and build relationships with subject matter experts, policymakers, and researchers to inform their understanding of industries beyond their own. They are no longer afraid to get their hands dirty learning about climate science or housing materials, or approaching politicians, in order to achieve their goals.For example, in techs indefinite era, Googles parent company Alphabet launched Sidewalk Labs as an urban innovation company, which touted a project in Toronto featuring buzzy smart-city technology including sensors and touchscreens to help residents visualize energy usage and traffic patterns. The project never materialized. In todays definite era, wealthy tech patrons want to back San Franciscos GrowSF, which prioritizes outcomes over ideologies and whose plans for the city read more like a sensible agenda than a sci-fi novel: build homeless shelters, construct subway tunnels and bike lanes, and elect politicians who can get it all done.Another example of the shift  or the need for it  can be seen in the work of Jennifer Pahlka. Serving as U.S. Deputy Chief Technology Officer in the Obama administration, founder of Code for America, and creator of the United States Digital Service, Pahlka was one of the most visible faces of techs relationship to government in the 2010s. Code for America connects software engineers and designers with city governments to build web applications; the United States Digital Service is a government tech unit that consults federal agencies on how to improve their digital services, founded partly as a response to the disastrous technical rollout of Healthcare.gov in 2013.But digital tech alone was never a solution. In her 2023 book, Recoding America: Why Government Is Failing in the Digital Age and How We Can Do Better, Pahlka argues that people in government chronically undervalue the challenge of implementation of new digital projects, simply outsourcing them to software contractors and expecting that they mindlessly follow orders, rather than take part in the design process itself. Although government must adapt to an increasingly digital world, Pahlka writes, the heart of the adaptation isnt mobile apps, cloud computing, or even artificial intelligence. Instead, we have to examine and challenge the underlying structures, assumptions, and values that drive the larger system of government in which the bureaucracy of implementation operates.There was a time when indefinite optimists believed in disruption and move fast and break things. Now definite optimists believe in progress and acceleration. In the abstract, the two sets of concepts seem indistinguishable from one another. The difference is in strategy and tactics, and it is a more grounded focus on building for the future that effective accelerationists preach.Definite optimists strive for concrete goals, but e/acc is not, at least in its current form, a prescriptive movement with an agenda. Instead, e/acc is best understood as a cultural mirror, or what Jezos calls a meta philosophy. It reflects a shift in sentiment across many subcultures of builders, all of whom think tech has more to offer the world than overfunded software startups filled with free snacks and ping pong tables.Jezos himself was, he says, a theoretical physicist with a graduate degree who joined a Big Tech company to work on machine learning. After three years, he quit, disgusted with the lifestyle. So much of what is broken with big tech is because it selects for pure status-seekers rather than builders, he tweeted. Jezos sold his car, moved back in with his parents to save money, and eventually took out a personal loan to start a company, buying $100,000 worth of GPUs and building an army of workstations in his home.It was while Jezos was working in Big Tech that he created a pseudonymous Twitter account and found others to talk to. In the early days of the Covid pandemic, confined to their homes, he and a handful of other accounts began having late-night discussions on Twitter Spaces  a voice-only conversation app  about where the world was going. Like Jezos, many of them also worked in Big Tech and were frustrated by the milquetoast ambitions of their organizations. And like Jezos, they tweeted as a way to vent, while using pseudonyms to avoid repercussions at work. (Against his will, Jezoss real identity was revealed by Forbes in December.) E/acc emerged from these conversations as a philosophy for builders to express how they feel about their role in society and what theyre contributing to civilization, and how they can feel happy with their day-to-day lives, Jezos explained in an interview on the Moment of Zen podcast. It was an antidote to the shame and embarrassment that lingered from the tech backlash, a way to take back the spirit of tech.E/acc was cooked up when some Big Tech engineers were very talented but crushed by top-down bureaucracy, Beff reminisced on a Twitter Space last March. On a subsequent Space, he added: Theres a pervasive mind virus in a lot of Big Tech organizations that causes a lot of engineers working on powerful tech to have self-hatred. Its not healthy at all. They kind of get depressed because the whole system tells them that they are bad. I was thinking, lets make an ideology where the engineers and builders are heroes.E/acc is a litmus test for whether someone is a corporate wagie, mindlessly collecting paychecks at a Big Tech company or overfunded startup, or whether the person believes that tech, at its best, is not merely another industry like finance or fashion but a safe haven for people from all backgrounds to build the future they envision, free from cynical naysayers.Having descended down the other side of the backlash, tech is now preoccupied with solving problems in the physical world with a more sophisticated toolkit than before. There is an influx of founders starting deep tech companies, which tackle complex technical and scientific challenges in areas such as nuclear energy, aerospace, and biotech  all unthinkable in the previous era, when the mention of anything non-software sent investors running in the other direction. Whats more, the new founders now come from a different talent pool, bringing deep expertise from hard scientific and engineering backgrounds.And this activity isnt just restricted to startups anymore, either. Tech now understands the role that policy can play in helping  or hindering  them to build faster, across an array of issues. The Institute for Progress, a tech-minded D.C. policy think tank, is partnering with the National Science Foundation to design and test new ways to fund research and innovation. Founders working in and around artificial intelligence travel to D.C. to meet with policymakers, from Amjad Masad seeking to demonstrate the positive and pragmatic side of AI through his software-creation platform Replit, to Clem Delangue advocating for transparency, openness, and distribution of value and power with AI developer-tool company Hugging Face.We are also seeing techs ethos attract like-minded people from other sectors, even if they dont have backgrounds in startups. Ezra Klein of the New York Times and Derek Thompson of the Atlantic are two of the most prominent voices advocating for abundance. Dartmouth economics professor Heidi Williams leads the Institute for Progresss science policy efforts. Frontier, a $1billion initiative started by Stripe to kickstart the carbon removal market, relies upon a panel of advisors and technical reviewers from industry, research, and academia.The newest generation of technologists knows they wont derive long-term satisfaction from building a trivial product feature and selling it to a Big Tech company for a few hundred million dollars. They want to rekindle the torch of tech from before the glut and frivolity of the startup frenzy, the part thats still acceptable to memorialize in Hollywood biopics about Nikola Tesla and Alan Turing. And they realize now that accomplishing this will require them to expand their own skills and knowledge, instead of believing that software alone will save (or eat) the world.Not all of their efforts are associated with effective accelerationism itself, but they grew from the same psychological place that drove Beff Jezos and his peers to ruminate about the purpose of tech during the pandemic. There is a groundswell of excitement in tech, still rising, that feels like a palate cleanser to the doom and gloom of the post-backlash era. E/acc may not offer the roadmap that definite optimists need, but it signals a shift in tech culture that is long overdue.
