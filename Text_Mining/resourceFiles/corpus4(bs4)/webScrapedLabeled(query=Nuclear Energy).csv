risk,Pethokoukis is an economic policy analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, CNBC contributor, and author of The Conservative Futurist: How to Create the Sci-Fi World We Were Promised. You can also read his newsletter, Faster, Please! on Substack.We live in an emerging age of technological signs and wonders. Among the tantalizing possibilities: Genetic medicine to cure Alzheimers and cancer. Reusable rockets to build an orbital economy and Moon colony. New kinds of nuclear reactors that are easier to build and could supply nearly limitless clean energy. And the next U.S. president just might step to the podium in the West Wing and announce that an American technology company has created an artificial intelligence as smart as the best human mind. Such a seemingly sci-fi advance could radically change the job market, government finances, scientific research, and, really, the entire American way of lifeyet almost certainly for the better overall, as I explain in my new book, The Conservative Futurist: How to Create the Sci-Fi World We Were Promised.No guarantees, however, that any of these marvels will happen anytime soon. History suggests skepticism is warranted. Last year marked the 50th anniversary of what I call the Great Downshift, a slow-motion economic catastrophe right up there with the Great Depression as the biggest disaster in American economic history. In 1973, U.S. labor productivity growthworker output per hour, the critical factor driving long-term improvement in living standardscollapsed during a nasty two-year recession and never really recovered for any extended length of time except for the few years of the internet boom before and after the year 2000. If productivity growth had merely remained at the pace seen in the years before 1973, the size of the American economy would be roughly 50 percent larger than it is today, or $40 trillion rather than $26 trillion. And had it accelerated as some were predicting back then, Americans might be twice or three times as rich as they are today.What exactly happened a half-century ago remains an economic mystery. Nothing so significant has a single cause. But one of the most probable suspects is simply that we failed to dream up new technological marvels anywhere near as economically important as those of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, such as the internal combustion engine and widespread electrification. The combination of the personal computer and internet was important, of course, but not enough on its own to return the economy to the productivity growth rates of the past.  Unlike those great inventions of old, economist Robert Gordon has explained, the Information Technology Revolution generated benefits that were more narrowly focusedpredominantly concentrated on entertainment and communications, such as advancements from VCRs to smartphonesand reached a point of diminishing returns more quickly. Productive progress in the world of atoms rather than bits, such as energy, housing, and transportation, has been more modest.Yet when the future optimists of the immediate postwar decadestechnologists, CEOs, think tankers, and hard science-fiction writers such as Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asimovimagined the world of the early 21st century, they assumed advances of the sort we are only now seeing in AI, biology, energy, and space would be old news. We should also be well on our way to controlling the weather, mining asteroids, and, of course, zipping around in flying cars. Their biggest mistake wasnt perhaps just underestimating the technical difficulties of achieving such advances. They also assumed that key factors enabling such leaps were a permanent feature of the American political economy: massive federal spending on R&D, an unfettered regulatory environment, and a broadly techno-optimistic culture supportive of such pro-progress policies no matter the downsides. In other words, a Neverending 50 and 60s.How fast technological progress goes depends on how much we, as a society, want it, Arthur Turrell, a plasma physicist whose book The Star Builders: Nuclear Fusion and the Race to Power the Planet documents the effort to achieve nuclear fusion, told me soon after the energy breakthrough in December 2022. Societal will and investment can speed up technologyjust look at the development and deployment of vaccines during the [coronavirus pandemic]. Given that achieving fusion is perhaps the greatest technological challenge weve ever taken on as a species, funding for fusion to date has not been equal to the task. Progress could have been much faster.Well, better late than never. Generative AI models by themselves could return productivity growth to what it was before the Great Downshift,accordingto the bank Goldman Sachs[LW3][JP4], by automating some of what workers do and making them more efficient at doing other tasks. More gains could come from accelerating scientific research. Tamay Besiroglu, a visiting research scientist at MITs Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory,thinksAI automating crucial scientific and engineering tasks, like drug discovery and chip design, could potentially amplify productivity growth rates by five times or more by mid-century. If so, the American economy could be multiples bigger than Washington is currently expecting.But it would be a potentially massive mistake to just assume a giant leap forward is guaranteed as did the optimists of the 1960s and late 1990s. For this broad technological revolution to reach its full potential as fast as possible, we need to avoid the mistakes of the past. We need to reform and repeal 1970s-era environmental regulations that make it maddeningly hard to build big projects in America today, either quickly or cheaply. Likewise, America needs to again spend at Project Apollo levels on the science research, or a tripling as a share of GDP, that drives technological progress and long-term economic growth. Doubling total national R&D spending, both public and private, could raise U.S. productivity and real per-capita income growth rates by 0.5 percentage points per year, according to Northwestern University economist Benjamin Jones.But new technologies and better policies arent enough. With rapid progress comes disruption to the status quo. Humans have an innate bias against change, behavioral economists find, such as fearing big changes to a current job even if the result might be higher pay down the line. We need a culture that can help us imagine how tech progress and growth can create a future we would want to live in. If not, well be reluctant to accept the inherent disruptionto our jobs, our companies, and our communitiesthat comes with change. But coincident with the Great Downshift in productivity growth was a long-term change of national attitude about the future, one for the worse. Yale University economist Ray Fair sees the early-1970s decline in U.S. infrastructure spending as a share of GDP and the start of persistent government budget deficits as suggesting that the United States became less future oriented beginning around 1970. This change has persisted." The logic: Repairing your roof while the sun is shining and curbing spending before the bill collector calls require foresight and the ability to place the current you in the shoes of the future you.But government stats only tell part of the story here. The other part is the actual stories we started telling ourselves. Influenced by an emerging environmental movement that was certain our techno-capitalist civilization risked collapse from overpopulation (see 1968's The Population Bomb) and overconsumption (see 1972's The Limits to Growth), Hollywood began delivering a steady diet of dystopia and never really stopped. Is it any wonder that three-fourths of Americans want to slow the development of AI when our cultural touchstone is The Terminator, a film franchise frequently mentioned in media stories about the technology? Is it any surprise that many young people suffer from climate anxiety when films and TV shows suggest were helpless to do much about it? Extrapolations, a recent big-budget, star-studded Apple TV+ series, depicts a wrecked future where national leaders could never get their act together. (No mention of nuclear power, by the way.)Even the American president isnt immune. Before issuing his new executive order on AI last October, Joe Biden watched the Tom Cruise film Mission: ImpossibleDead Reckoning Part One while spending the weekend at Camp David. The films villain is a sentient AI: If [Biden] hadnt already been concerned about what could go wrong with AI before that movie, he saw plenty more to worry about, said White House aide Bruce Reed, who watched the film with the president.Better pro-growth policy would help tremendously. A new study from Harvard University finds that people who grow up in times of economic abundance and growth tend to have a positive-sum mindset, believing the pie can expand for all. But those raised in tougher conditions are more zero-sum. They're skeptical that hard work brings success. But we also need to tell ourselves a more optimistic story of the future. Credit to Jeff Bezos for having Amazon Studios continue The Expanse series after it was canceled by the SyFy network. The show depicts humanity surviving climate change, colonizing the solar system, and living longer. More billionaires could also directly finance optimistic media like Elon Musk's Mars colonization videos. New AI tools will increasingly allow future optimists to create their own sophisticated images of the future if Hollywood wont.Our schools also have a role to play in creating a more risk-taking generation. They should assign classic adventures from Jules Verne, Jack London, and Laura Ingalls Wilder, and modern books like Andy Weir's The Martian about an innovative astronaut stranded on Mars. We could also devise pro-progress thought experiments like a "Genesis Clock" that tracks indicators of scientific and economic advancement as a conceptual counter to the famous Doomsday Clock. I, for one, am more interested in how many minutes to a Dawn of civilizational superabundance than a supposed Midnight of human extinction.The conservative futurist Herman Kahn said humanity would be fine barring disastrous luck or incredibly bad decisions. Bad luck can create opportunity, however. Russias invasion of Ukraine and the difficulty of reducing carbon emissions with wind and solar alone have given new life to nuclear energy around the world. Tensions with China provide an excuse to treat and fund AI as the new Space Race.After a half century of disappointment, Ill take whatever help I can get if it means a future of radically reduced poverty, healthier lives, and a society resilient to existential problems, from climate change to pandemics to a stray chunk of space ice slamming into our planet. Flying cars would be nice, too.
risk,Nuclear energy was an unexpected winner at COP28, the United Nations global climate conference that recently concluded in the United Arab Emirates. More than 24 countries, including the United States, and 120 companies committed to tripling nuclear energy by 2050 as an essential part of mitigating climate change. The principal goal is carbon-free energy available 24/7 as an essential complement to variable wind and solar electricity. After years of skepticism, there is growing political momentum for nuclear energy, but if countries follow the current model of plant construction, they will not get where they have pledged to go. The world needs a new strategy for nuclear energy deployment that furthers climate goals, enhances grid reliability, and ensures that achieving energy security doesnt erode global security.To make good on the COP pledge, accounting for a ramp-up time, the world will soon need to build the equivalent of about 50 large nuclear power reactors per year until 2050. This is two-thirds more than were built at nuclear powers peak in the early 1980s, and the current pace of construction is well short of that.Seventeen countries are building just one or two reactors at a time, each sometimes taking over a decade to build. In the West, nuclear construction projects are often long, complex, and characterized by delays and cost over-runs. Regulatory uncertainty and long timelines discourage investment. China, Russia, South Korea, and now the UAE have demonstrated the ability to build new nuclear reactors effectively, but this alone is clearly insufficient. Newcomer nuclear countries like Poland, Ghana, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines are looking to deploy domestically, but it will take time and considerable resources to meet simultaneously their project management, regulatory, security, finance and workforce ambitions.To succeed, nations must rethink how to build, regulate, and finance nuclear technology. The United States offers a case in point. The second of two new-build gigawatt-scale nuclear reactors in Georgia is showing the immense value of learning from experience, but there arent any other projects in the pipeline to take advantage of those lessons learned. The next US nuclear build will likely need to go back to basics without the benefits of an experienced workforce as technology evolves and schedules from commitment to operation extend well over a decade.A new system will need to deliver standardized products rather than costly and risky one-off multi-decade projects. This could mean relying on proven designs of gigawatt-scale reactors, or embracing a selection of new smaller designs amenable to assembly-line methods (analogous to those in the airline and shipbuilding industries), or some combination of both. Many countries, including the United States, have expressed strong interest in small modular reactors, but the reality is that little progress is being made.It will require groups of customers of zero-carbon always-available electricity  utilities, large industrial users, large IT companies  to agree to purchase electricity or heat from dozens of nuclear plants of the same design. This so-called orderbook approach, common in the aviation industry, would address many flaws of the current model by sending a durable demand signal to the nuclear supply chain, pooling resources, and unlocking workforce development, thereby reducing risks and costs. With each new reactor built, countries, companies, investors, and policy makers also learn more, saving time and money.Public-private partnerships will probably be needed to implement this vision. Governments can help motivate the parties by offering financial risk backstops that could provide further confidence to private-sector developers, lowering first-of-a-kind risks. But more may be needed to launch a true nuclear renaissance, since nuclear construction is capital intensive. Especially for countries launching new nuclear programs, multilateral banks such as the World Bank and European Investment Bank must rebuild their nuclear finance capabilities and provide necessary capital to support the formation of orderbook transactions; new multilateral facilities might be considered as well.In addition, the current process for certifying nuclear reactor designs is based on an inefficient country-by-country approach. Developing an international body charged with issuing a single globally accepted generic certification for reactor designs would further lower the barriers to nuclear deployment. Nuclear can look to the aviation industrys model, which certifies aircraft, subject to strict and uniform standards, across countries.Current geopolitical tensions in Europe and in the Middle East reinforce the importance of scaling up in a way that maintains strong nuclear nonproliferation and security standards. If greater energy security leads to more nuclear weapons, the nuclear energy enterprise will be compromised. Countries can meet these standards by tried and true practices of allowing international monitoring, relying on the international market for fuel rather than enriching their own, and avoiding weapons-usable materials as fuel. New approaches to transparency and verification can simultaneously alleviate concerns and free up unfettered international assistance.Countries dont need to wait to get started. The organization charged with ensuring the safe, secure, and peaceful uses of nuclear energy, the International Atomic Energy Agency, is convening heads of state in Brussels in March to focus on expanding nuclear energy. This presents an important opportunity to begin putting the pieces of the plan outlined here in place. Countries should come ready to support the formation of orderbooks for specific nuclear reactor designs. Leaders should also lay the groundwork for enhanced regional and international institutions focusing on regulatory standardization, financial support, and workforce development.While each country will need to pursue its own individual pathway to nuclear energy, its essential the international community collectively reforms the system to enable success. Having recognized the need to expand nuclear energy, countries must now focus on cooperative implementation and work together to create the conditions for sustained scale-up of this important climate and energy security solution.Ernest J.

risk,Its a very, very sad situation  its upsetting a lot of tribes in this region, said Carletta Tilousi, a former Havasupai council member who has been leading the tribes opposition to uranium mining in the south-west. But I think we all knew this was eventually going to happen.But an agreement at Cop28 to triple nuclear energy production as a means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions has boosted demand. Energy Fuels Inc began operations at the Pinyon Plain mine in December and has also begun ramping up production at its Pandora and La Sal mines in Utah, near Moab.The company cited rising uranium prices in a statement about its activities, as well as increased buying interest from US nuclear utilities, US and global government policies supporting nuclear energy to address global climate change, and the need to reduce US reliance on Russian and Russian-controlled uranium and nuclear fuel among their reasons to ramp-up production. The US still buys uranium from Russia, despite sanctions imposed after Russias 2022 invasion of Ukraine, but lawmakers have been seeking to divest from the country.The Arizona department of environmental quality (ADEQ) in 2022 issued an aquifer protection permit to the company, after it showed it was using the latest systems to prevent discharge from filtering into groundwater reserves. There is no science to support the contention that groundwater is at risk, Curtis Moore, a spokesperson with Energy Fuel, told the Guardian.Prior to issuing the permit, ADEQ professionals spent more than one thousand hours conducting a comprehensive review of this extensive technical record before determining that adverse impacts to groundwater were extremely unlikely, a spokesperson for the agency said. The agency reviewed environmental studies, permits, engineering and hydrological reports over 30 years information from the US Geological Survey, to conclude that the rock layers between the mine and the Redwall-Muav aquifer that the Havasupai Tribe relies on are highly impermeable.For the Havasupai Nation, such reassurances are not enough, said Tilousi. In the four corners region of the south-west, the uranium mining in the 20th century littered the Navajo Nation with abandoned mines and tainted aquifers, leaving a generation of Din workers and their families with lung cancer and other respiratory illness. The Havasupai and other Indigenous communities are weary, she said.Were not willing to risk the livelihood of my community  of 767 tribal members  for the sake of one mining company, she said. One mishap or misestimation could risk permanently contaminating the sole water source for the tribe, she argued, in a drought-stricken region where water supplies are already limited.The tribe, as well as local environmental groups, argue that theres been no extensive study of how groundwater in the region moves and that a plan to undertake long-term study of water impacts first proposed by the Obama administration had stalled.And, they say, past incidents at the site are cause for concern. In 2016, mine-shaft drilling by Energy Fuel pierced shallow aquifers, causing a surge of contaminated water. In 2017, when the facilitys evaporation pond approached capacity, miners spayed contaminated water into the nearby Kaibab national forest.We encountered shallow, isolated aquifers when we drove the shaft, but this was planned and anticipated by us and the regulators, Moore said, disputing that the 2016 incident was an issue. In 2017, he said the company swiftly responded and adapted systems to prevent such an occurrence in the future.The mine also abuts two of the tribes most sacred sites  Wiii Gdwiisa and Mat Taav Tiivjunmdva. The tribes creation stories centre on those sites, but fall outside their trust land borders, after they were evicted from the Grand Canyon National Park in 1919.Bidens national monument declaration last year prevented new mining claims within the borders of Baaj Nwaavjo Itah Kukveni, but due to the stipulations of an 1872 mining law, mines under development prior to the federal governments projections were exempted from the ban. The Gold Rush-era law, which still governs mining operations, allowed miners to seize public lands without regard for whether the sites had been home to Indigenous people  and environmental groups are continuing to push for its reform.There are so many reasons why this mine doesnt belong where it is, said Amber Reimondo, the energy director with the Grand Canyon Trust, an environmental group focused on protecting the region. And the fact that it is allowed to operate is a stark example of the weaknesses in our regulatory system.Across the south-west, local communities and tribes have been pushing back against uranium mining proposals, including in Utah, where the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe is concerned about air pollution from a nearby Energy Fuels mill facility. Similar tensions have arisen around lithium mining in the west, as a need for the metal in clean energy components grows.In the rush to move away from fossil fuels, we are neglecting communities and recreating cycles of harm, Reimondo said. In order to have a truly just clean energy future, we have to actually work with Indigenous communities.General Motors has hired battery expert and ex-Tesla executive Kurt Kelty to be the automaker's new vice president of batteries -- a brand new role for the company.  Kelty will join GM at a time when the company has struggled to increase the output of the battery packs for its new Ultium platform, which is supposed to power its next-generation electric vehicles.  The foundation that GM has established coupled with Kurts exceptional battery expertise in leading battery chemistry development, establishing partnerships, building out supply chains and partnering closely with teams that have developed leading battery systems will help us achieve our electrification goals and position GM as a leader in EV technology, GM president Mark Reuss said in a statement.GenAI might be one of the most exciting technologies today.  With each new GenAI innovation, companies have to worry not only about staying on top of trends but validating what's working, all while maintaining a semblance of accuracy, compliance and security.  Arcee, for instance, is creating solutions to help businesses securely train, benchmark and manage GenAI models, and Articul8 AI, an Intel spin-out, is building algorithm-powered enterprise software.To build a fusion power plant, engineers are forced to make some difficult choices.  Thea Energy is hoping that both is the right answer.  The startup is betting that software can supplant manufacturing precision in its quest to deliver reliable, inexpensive fusion power.Californias auto regulator, theDepartment of Motor Vehicles (DMV), is investigating an incident that occurred on Tuesday, where a driverless Waymo car collided with a cyclist, according to a report by Reuters.  San Francisco cops said that the cyclist suffered non-fatal injuries, as per a report by SFGate.  Waymo, which is owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, said there was only one person in the car, who didnt suffer injuries.India's central bank said Thursday it takes supervisory actions and imposes business restrictions only after "persistent non-compliance" with rules, its first comment after a clampdown on Paytm last week has posed existential questions about the future of the leading financial services firm.  Shaktikanta Das, the Reserve Bank of India governor, said the central bank always engages with regulated entities bilaterally and nudges them to take corrective action.  If the central bank takes actions, "it is always proportionate to the gravity of the situation," said Das, pictured above, in a media briefing.Attentive.ai, a startup building vertical software for landscaping and construction services in the U.S., has raised $7 million in a new funding round as it looks to enhance its AI-led offerings and expand them to more businesses.  Led by Vertex Ventures Southeast Asia and India, the all-equity Series A round, which follows the earlier $5 million seed investment, also received participation from Attentive.ai's existing investors: Peak XV's Surge and InfoEdge Ventures.  Additionally, Mumbai-based investment firm Tenacity Ventures has come on board this time through a secondary investment.
risk,Building a nuclear submarine program from scratch is anything but easy, but when they set out to do so, the Australian navy knew exactly who to turn to for expertise. Shortly after the announcement, Australian Vice Admiral Jonathan Mead in an interview suggested sending staff to MIT.That offhand comment eventually found its way to Jacopo Buongiorno, professor of nuclear science and engineering and director of the Center for Advanced Nuclear Energy Systems at MIT, and served as inspiration for the newest executive education course offered by the Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering (NSE).Titled "Nuclear Technology for Marine Propulsion," the three-week course was attended by 20 senior leaders from the Australian Submarine Agency (ASA) and other officials, and covered a broad range of topics, including the basics of nuclear reactor theory and design, operations and safety, training, the operation of nuclear shipyards, and more."NSE is truly excited for the opportunity to help the Australian navy as they navigate the establishment of their nuclear program," says Benoit Forget, NSE department head and Korea Electric Power Professor of Nuclear Engineering, who co-directed the course. "Understanding the technology and establishing foundational safety principles is essential to the long-term success of their project, and we were glad to see the importance they attributed to these principles by seeking our help."Sessions were led by MIT faculty and a variety of external subject matter experts and included special guests like MIT Vice President for Research Maria Zuber and retired U.S. Navy admirals Jim Ellis and John Richardson."The technical content of the course was rich," Buongiorno says. "We started with nuclear physics, reactor physics, thermal-hydraulics, nuclear materials, fuel performance, and the nuclear fuel cycle, and then expanded into what one might call the 'softer' aspects of nuclear technology, such as training, oversight, safety culture, supply chain, the role of the national labs, etc.""For example, in-depth training of people and the creation of a robust safety culture are critically important because nuclear reactors are not a particularly tolerant technology," he continues. "Hence the need for relentless attention to detail and conservative decision-making. Therefore, we felt from the very beginning that this should not be a purely technical course."While it is the newest professional education course offered by NSE, the ASA course was modeled after another course, called "Reactor Technology Course for Nuclear Utility Executives," which the department has offered for more than three decades, jointly with the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations. In both cases, Buongiorno says, the goal is to ensure participants come away with a basic understanding of nuclear technology, feel confident to ask smart questions, and make the right decisions in their respective positions.Given the important future roles of the course participants - many were senior leaders in the Australian navy, government, and policy community - the course may end up having significant impacts, he adds."The Australian navy course is one more recent example of the international involvement and impact of my NSE colleagues," Forget says. "Two additional recent examples are the Global Forum Rising Stars Workshop, in collaboration with the Nuclear Energy Agency, that brought together incredible female researchers from around the world, and the 2023 David J. Rose Lecture given by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Mariano Grossi, who discussed the role of the IAEA on global nuclear safety."Providing such executive education, Buongiorno says, is central to MIT NSE's mission. In addition to courses for the ASA and utility executives, the department in recent years launched a three-day course for policymakers, legislators, journalists, and others, titled Nuclear Energy: Facts and Issues, has offered a course on Nuclear Operational Risk Management for a decade, and its longest-running course, on Nuclear Plant Safety, has been offered annually since 1966."The mission of our department is not limited to technology development and education of our students.

"We started with nuclear physics, reactor physics, thermal-hydraulics, nuclear materials, fuel performance, and the nuclear fuel cycle, and then expanded into what one might call the 'softer' aspects of nuclear technology, such as training, oversight, safety culture, supply chain, the role of the national labs, etc.""For example, in-depth training of people and the creation of a robust safety culture are critically important because nuclear reactors are not a particularly tolerant technology," he continues. "Hence the need for relentless attention to detail and conservative decision-making. Therefore, we felt from the very beginning that this should not be a purely technical course."While it is the newest professional education course offered by NSE, the ASA course was modeled after another course, called "Reactor Technology Course for Nuclear Utility Executives," which the department has offered for more than three decades, jointly with the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations.

risk,
risk,On a windy day last August, President Joe Biden signed a proclamation protecting the canyons, cliffs, and plateaus surrounding the Grand Canyon National Park, nearly a million acres abutting the Navajo Nation and Havasupai Indian Reservation.Biden said the new national monument was part of his commitment to Native peoples to protect their sacred lands. Preserving the Grand Canyon as a national park was used to deny Indigenous people full access to their homelands, Biden acknowledged.To Carletta Tilousi, one of the leaders of the Havasupai Tribe who have called the Grand Canyon home for more than 800 years, Bidens presence and his words felt momentous. Finally, the small voices of Indigenous people have been heard in the White House, she thought.But she knew the fight was not over. The monument prevented hundreds of mining claims, but two uranium mines were grandfathered in, in part due to an 1872 law that guaranteed their right to operate. And now, nearly 40 years after first gaining permission to extract uranium, a Colorado-based company is cashing in.The companys decision was influenced by favorable federal policies supporting nuclear energy, high prices for uranium ore, and greater demand for domestic nuclear fuel. The U.S. purchased 12 percent of its uranium from Russia in 2022, and theres growing political pressure to stop those imports in the face of Russias war against Ukraine.    The 17-acre Pinyon Plain Mine is 12 miles from the Grand Canyon, six miles from the Grand Canyon National Park, and four miles north of Red Butte, a site sacred to the Havasupai people where Biden gave his August address. The Havasupai Tribe sued along with environmental groups to prevent the mine from starting production, but lost its case in 2022.Energy Fuels plans to operate the mine for three years to six years and estimates that it will generate 2 million pounds of uranium, says Curtis Moore, senior vice president of marketing and corporate development.After mining operations are complete, the Pinyon Plain area will be fully reclaimed and returned to its natural state, the company has promised. There will be virtually no evidence a mine ever occupied the site.Amber Reimondo is doubtful. Shes energy director at the Grand Canyon Trust, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting the Grand Canyon and the Colorado Plateau that sued to prevent the mine along with the Havasupai Tribe, and says uranium mining threatens the aquifer in the greater Grand Canyon area.According to Reimondo, water systems in the landscape are complex and interconnected. Energy Fuels mining process involves drilling a mine shaft through shallow aquifers into uranium deposits, and water flows into the shaft, mixing with the ore, before being pumped out. The concern is that contaminated water will be mixed back into the groundwater.To date, the company has removed about 49 million gallons of water from the shaft, leaving it to evaporate in an aboveground pool or sharing it with local ranchers for their cattle once treated to EPA standards. Reimondo worries that water could eventually contaminate not only drinking water sources but the creeks and waterfalls throughout the Grand Canyon.Its really, really difficult for researchers to understand exactly what that risk is, because the region is so highly fractured and because we dont know exactly where water flows to and from, Reimondo said.Energy Fuels Curtis Moore thinks that concern is overblown. He said that the water that the company pumps out of the shaft is already highly concentrated in uranium because it has been in contact with the rocks long before their mining operations started.Their implication is that we are contaminating groundwater, which is simply false  its naturally not appropriate for human consumption, he said. He pointed to a 2022 permit from the state of Arizona that concluded the geology of the mine site like the slope of the land and type of rock are expected to prevent any potential impacts to groundwater resulting from mining operations.A separate 2021 study by scientists from the U.S. Geological Society found that the type of uranium mining conducted at Pinyon Plain Mine has historically had no confirmed effects on uranium levels in the groundwater sampled in and around the Grand Canyon. But the study also noted that it could take many years for any related pollution to reach the groundwater.That potential for negative long-term effects are what Havasupai Tribe members are concerned about. Dianna Uqualla, a Havasupai Tribal Council member, says if theres pollution in the aquifer years from now, she doubts anyone will take responsibility.Whos going to pay the price? she asked. Whos going to be the one to say, Yeah, I did it? I dont think anybodys going to do that. Theyre just going to say, Well, one less tribe, and were happy for that, is what the non-Natives will probably think.Uqualla is familiar with the long history of damage wrought by uranium mining on Native lands. In the nearby Navajo Nation, years of uranium mining caused lung cancer and a decadeslong struggle to get compensation. The mining was so widely harmful that the Navajo Nation has banned the transport of radioactive and related materials through their lands.Despite that ban, once mined, the uranium ore from Pinyon Plain Mine will be trucked to the White Mesa Mill in southern Utah along state and federal highways, including through Navajo Nation. Navajo President Buu Nygren has implored the federal government to step in on the matter.Once the ore makes it to White Mesa Mill, the company will extract natural uranium concentrate from the uranium ore, before selling the powder to U.S. nuclear power facilities, which arrange for the concentrate to be sent to other facilities for conversion and enrichment.Tilousi wishes that Congress would update the 1872 mining law that allowed Energy Fuels to continue operating a mine on a national monument. Thats something the Biden administration has recommended too, in part because the law allows companies to hold mining rights for long periods of time, which sows distrust among local communities including Indigenous peoples.Grist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.

risk,The fund plans to invest in the expansion of clean energy, accelerate sustainable solutions and technologies, and help companies within carbon-intensive sectors transition to more sustainable business practices. Its seed portfolio reportedly includes an onshore renewables developer in the United Kingdom and a solar partnership in India.Brookfield also expresses plans to achieve a larger fundraiser than its previous transition fund. The Canadian companys first fund closed at $15 billion in June of 2022, becoming the largest fund of its kind in the world. Investments from that first financing round are currently going toward renewable power, business transformation, carbon capture and storage, renewable natural gas, and nuclear services.We have demonstrated beyond doubt the breadth and scale of attractive investment opportunities in the transition to a net zero economy, said Mark Carney, chair and head of transition investing for Brookfield. By going where the emissions are, the Brookfield Global Transition Fund strategy is aiming to deliver strong risk-adjusted financial returns for investors and make meaningful environmental impacts for people and the planet.In November 2023, Brookfield and Cameco jointly acquired global nuclear giant, Westinghouse, citing a lasting demand outlook for nuclear power. Westinghouse is the core service provider for over 50% of the worlds operating nuclear reactors. The company has also developed small modular reactors and other next-generation advanced reactors, which are expected to drive future nuclear energy development.Despite mixed opinions on nuclear powers role in the clean energy transition, the industry has been identified as a major contributor to meeting global electricity demand through clean energy sources.Nuclear is currently the second largest global source of clean energy after hydropower, and the International Energy Agency expects nuclear energy generation to reach an all-time global high by early 2025 to meet this rising demand. The U.K. also released plans earlier this year to increase nuclear generation by up to four times its current amounts, making the energy source a key piece of its overall decarbonization strategy.
risk,Estonia plans to build a small modular reactor (SMR) to wean itself off the addiction to pollutingoil shale and meet its target of producing 100% decarbonised electricity by 2030. A vote in Parliament is expected in the first half of 2024, officials say.Antti Tooming, deputy undersecretary of the Ministry of Climate and head of the working group, told the press in December that nuclear energy has the potential to ensure a stable energy supply in Estonia for future generations.In an interview with Energy Intelligence, he explained that the nuclear programme supports our ambitions towards the 2050 climate neutrality goal. Moreover, it helps us to achieve electricity security in Estonia, so we can cover our own electricity needs with electricity produced in Estonia.Reelika Runnel, coordinator of the Estonian Nuclear Energy Working Group, told Euractiv that the report will be discussed within the government, where decisions will be taken on how to formulate the decision in principle on the potential use of nuclear energy.The Estonian Prime Minister, Kaja Kallas, said on Monday (15 January) in front of the Riigikogu (State Assembly of Estonia) that government discussions would take place either this week or next week.The official date for the vote on this bill has not yet been set, but the coordinator suggested that the Parliament will be ready to take a decision on the potential deployment of nuclear power in Estonia in the form of SMR, in the first half of 2024.Until now, Estonias energy independence was ensured by the exploitation of oil shale, one of the most polluting fossil fuels. This sedimentary rock can be burnt as a low-grade fuel for power generation and heating.Oil shale provided nearly half of primary energy in 2021 but due to the energy crisis, the share increased to 57% in 2022, explained Andrei Belyi, adjunct professor in energy law and policy at the University of Eastern Finland and CEO of Estonian energy consulting firm Balesene O.But for Antti Tooming, the development of renewable energies cannot be the only solution: Theres always not all the time wind and not all the time sun, and we dont yet have the technology for storage of electricity in that amount. We need a specific amount of dispatchable energy.Kalev Kallemets, CEO of Firmi Energia, a company set up in 2019 to promote SMR technology in Estonia, explained in emailed replies to Euractiv that the programme is now targeting two 300 MWe units, for a total of 600 MWe of electricity production and remote heat production.The technology chosen is the BWRX-300 reactor developed by GE Hitachi, according to a press statement released in February last year by Firmi Energia. The first prototype of this model is expected to be built in Canada and has also been selected by PKN Orlen in Poland for part of its planned fleet of 74 SMRs.Socio-economic impact analyses have been carried out for the remaining 15 regions, Runnel explained. As a result, it was recommended that first consideration should be given to establishing a nuclear power plant in four regions, one of which is located in western Estonia and the other three on the northern coast, he told Euractiv.It has been concluded that, given the small size of Estonia, the location of the SMR is not of major importance. However, if the plant is located less than 50 km from the Russian border, additional safety considerations must be taken into account.The industry currently provides a livelihood for around 40% of the population in the Estonian region of Ida-Virumaa near the Russian border, contributing almost half to its GDP. The end of the shale industry could lead to the economic isolation of this mostly Russian-speaking region.The plan provides for investment in solar, wind and hydro power, as well as renewable hydrogen, and supports the development of renewable heating solutions. It also includes the restoration of contaminated brownfield sites, the Commission said, adding this will help create around 1,100 direct jobs for the region.The SMR project could be built on the site of a former oil shale site, thus providing access to a workforce with industrial experience, as well as attracting managers and higher white-collar professions to revitalise the region.The project is not consensual. Kadri Simson, the EUs energy commissioner who hails from Estonia, has expressed scepticism about the project, saying the countrys energy needs could be met with a better interconnected electricity market without requiring each EU country to build its own nuclear plant.Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas herself acknowledged that nuclear energy has pros and cons, without elaborating. In the sense that there has to be a popular consensus on this, I think that is absolutely correct, the prime minister told the Estonian assembly, according to public broadcaster ERR.
risk,Think back to 1986 and 2011. If youre a seasoned uranium futures trader, you will know the significance of these years, although most people wont have a clue. If the current trend in uranium continues, 2024 could be another historic year for a commodity thats usually under the radar but is suddenly popping up in the headlines.To recap, the Chernobyl nuclear meltdown took place in Russia (the Soviet Union, at that time) in 1986, and the Fukushima nuclear disaster occurred in Japan in 2011. Those two terrible incidents gave nuclear energy a bad rap, as the saying goes.We can debate all day long whether this bad rap is deserved or not, but todays focus will be on investment opportunities. Is there value now in recently explosive uranium stocks? Thats the billion-dollar question, so lets start by taking stock of recent moves in the spot uranium price, which will naturally affect all uranium-market stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in 2024.To understand whats going on in the sphere of uranium and nuclear energy, youll have to look outside of North America. It wont be much of a pleasure trip, but when conducting your due diligence, you have to go wherever the action is.Our first stopover will be in France, which hasnt traditionally been amenable to nuclear-power proliferation. Indeed, France has been among the vanguard nations that promote solar, wind and other clean-energy sources.However, France may be on the cusp of redefining clean energy sources to include nuclear power. Tough times require a certain measure of flexibility, but Frances recent about-face concerning nuclear energy is practically unheard of.Believe it or not, a high-profile pro-nuclear bill is currently working its way through the French governments highest levels. The bill would provide for six to 14 new nuclear reactors and promotes the sustainable choice of usingnuclear energyas a competitive and carbon-free electricity source.Theres no guarantee that this bill will become the law of the land, but its a sign that governments in Europe and elsewhere may turn to nuclear power to shore up their energy independence. Yet, while global demand for uranium may soon be on the rise, its the supply side of the equation thats really sending the spot uranium price soaring.Now its time to visit Eastern Europes Kazakhstan, where NAC Kazatomprom, the largest producer of uranium on the planet, warned that it will be difficult to achieve its 2024 and 2025 goals for uranium production. The company didnt update its production guidance, but it did observe challenges in sourcing the necessary sulfuric acid to extract uranium.Thus, weve learned two things on our unusual two-stop jaunt. First, the global demand for uranium could increase if typically reluctant governments change their stances on nuclear power. Second, a key uranium producer probably wont meet its previously stated production targets.These factors were evidently enough to push the spot uranium price above $100 not long ago. The exact price is a constantly moving target, but uranium watchers lit up social media on Monday with breathy posts like this one:When it comes to buying commodity-related stocks and ETFs, whats more important than how is the question of how much. Im certainly not against the idea of buying uranium stocks and funds now, but any and all position sizes should be very small.Consequently, investors might consider starting off with a few shares of the Global X Uranium ETF (NYSEARCA:URA) and the Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:URNM) for general uranium-market exposure. To that, they can add a handful of shares of Canada-based Cameco (NYSE:CCJ) and U.S.-headquartered Uranium Energy Corp. (NYSEAMERICAN:UEC).Disclaimer: All investments involve risk.

If you want to, you can skip our detailed robotics industry analysis and go directly to our shorter list of the 5 worst industrial disasters in the world.Industrial disasters are accidents that occur in industrial companies due to failure, negligence, or incompetence in handling chemical, mechanical, civil, electrical, or other processes. Since an industrial disaster involves dangerous chemicals and hazardous substances, it is a significant threat not just to humans, but also to the natural and infrastructural environment.Today, the industrial sector takes up a large portion of the world economy, making up 17.9% of the GDP of the United States, which is the largest economy in the world as of 2024. Over the decades, the industrial sector has maintained its position in the world economy. A detailed analysis of this conducted by the Industrial Analytics Platform further emphasizes the close link between industrial activities, economic growth, and sustainable development, and how industrial development will take a whole new level in the years to come.Given the importance of the industrial sector, it is also important to note that if the balance is tipped, there can be a significant impact on the world economy. Throughout history, weve seen multiple times how industrial disasters trigger huge economic losses and destabilize sustainable growth.Industrial disasters concern not just the manufacturing industries, but others as well. In 2022, the chemical industrys total revenue, on a global level, stood at around USD 5.72 trillion, reaching the highest value in the last 15 years. The chemical industry is growing at an exponential rate, but a minor negligence or failure involving chemicals like in the Bhopal Gas Tragedy can lead to a catastrophe.Similar to the chemical industry, the nuclear industry, which is responsible for generating 10% of the worlds electricity according to the World Nuclear Association, is also prone to disasters. For instance, in 2011, the Fukushima disaster in Japan was an eye-opener for many countries with nuclear energy plants. It dealt a heavy blow to Japan's economy, with its share of nuclear energy dropping from 29.2% in 2010-11 to 2.1% in 2012.Fortunately, the industrial sector continues to learn from past disasters and implement more safety precautions to safeguard the future. As world technology progresses, industrial workplace safety is enhanced and the risk of disasters is also minimized. One of the most effective solutions has been the incorporation of robotics technology as it can perform repetitive tasks faster and with much higher accuracy and precision than human workers.For the same reason, using robots and automating industrial manufacturing has been a growing trend in recent years. In 2023, there were around 4.09 million units of service robotics and 450 thousand units of industrial robots worldwide. (See: 15 Biggest Robotics Companies in the World). While human workers are still needed in industrial manufacturing, robots and machines can be used to handle hazardous chemicals and dangerous tasks to minimize industrial disasters.Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, economic growth has mainly come at the expense of the environment. While economies, populations, and resource demands grow continuously, the availability of resources remains the same, therefore urging industrial companies to adopt strategies in the modern world to uplift economies without exhausting natural resources.From human-centered processes to machine-reliant assembly lines to highly automated factories, industrial companies are adapting to new trends and transforming their methods. Some of the main reasons for adapting to new trends are to minimize the risk of disasters, improve efficiency, lower costs, and reduce material wastage.Some industrial companies are already incorporating Industry 4.0 in their manufacturing processes. For instance, HIROTEC Corporation, a major automotive supplier, uses the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) for operational intelligence and predicting maintenance in its manufacturing machines and assets.Some of the key players in the manufacturing companies are Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE: TM), Samsung Electronics (KSE: 005930), and BASF SE (ETR: BAS). All these industrial companies are well-aligned with Industry 4.0 and use it in their process management. In fact, in 2017, Apple partnered with GE to bring iOS into Industry 4. In 2023, Apple took more initiatives including the first Smart Manufacturing Forum for SMBs in South Korea, to showcase its serious involvement in the fourth industrial revolution.Over the years, Apple has invested millions of dollars in automation technology, and it is not the only one. Today, all industrial companies are prioritizing technology and development to reduce the risk of disasters and become the key players in their sector. At the same time, they acknowledge that automation technology cannot replace the skill of human workers even Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) did, in their conversation with The Information.For our list of the worst industrial disasters in the world, we analyzed a list of notable industrial disasters in the world and shortlisted the ones that incurred the most damage to human life and/or the economy. We ranked disasters based on the number of deaths caused by the disaster, going from the least to the highest. Weve also discussed financial and industrial losses caused by each disaster.By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

Still, many people were injured. This disaster took place in Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire, near the M1 motorway.The aftermath included a hefty cleanup, destroyed properties, and around 1 billion in damage. Total UK, Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd, and the British Pipeline Agency (BPA) were all fined after this disaster.On 10 July 1976, a chemical reactor exploded in the ICMESA plant located near Seveso, Italy. The disaster killed 3,000 farm animals immediately and left people with terrible health disorders. The explosion caused dioxins to leak into the area.While no human lives were lost as a result of the explosion, over 70,000 animals were euthanized to make sure no one would get harmed by the chemicals. To this day, the Seveso area is off-limits for any development.In the aftermath of this disaster, Seveso experienced financial consequences due to environmental damage, decreased property value, livestock loss, and agricultural loss. Healthcare costs also increased because of skin diseases caused by chemicals.The Deepwater Horizon Explosion of 2010 is known as one of the most significant oil spills and one of the worst industrial disasters in history. As a result of this disaster, 11 people lost their lives and 17 got severely injured.The Deepwater Horizon rig is owned by BP PLC (NYSE: BP), a leading oil company. According to a report published by BP, the explosion was a result of many causes all of which contributed to a wellhead explosion, the release of natural gas, and its eventual ignition at the rig. After the explosion, 1000 barrels of oil leaked into the ocean daily for 85.5 days.BP had to pay compensation of $20 million to the victims and families of those who lost their loved ones. A lot of damage was caused by this explosion, including thousands of marine animals dying. This explosion also left many people unemployed due to the lack of tourism in the petroleum-laden areas.Another tragic chemical explosion, the Texas city refinery disaster, was the result of a vapor cloud of chemicals catching on fire. One hundred eighty workers were heavily injured, and 15 lost their lives. This took place at a BP refinery in Texas when a vapor cloud exploded in its isomerization process unit.BP PLC (NYSE: BP) was sued for an environmental crime and charged a $50 million fine. BP PLC (NYSE: BP) also had to pay around $1.6 billion to compensate the victims. These continued until 2009 when OSHA charged BP a whopping $87 million fine.The deadly Phillips Disaster took place in 1989 when high-flammable gasses caused multiple explosions at the Phillips Petroleum Company (NYSE: PSX). Twenty-three people were killed and 314 were injured. The fire lasted for 10 hours, damaging water pipes and making it harder to put out.The Chernobyl disaster of 1986 is one of the most known industrial disasters and even inspired a $40 million show by HBO. The miniseries depicted the atrocities of the disaster and helped create awareness regarding industrial disasters. It is available to watch on Apple TV+(NASDAQ: AAPL) as well. The disaster took 50 lives and has left the entire area radioactive and inhabitable to this day. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone will be habitable again in 20,000 years.In April 1986, an explosion occurred at a Chernobyl nuclear plant. Perhaps the worst nuclear disaster to ever exist, over $68 billion was spent to help with migration. Chernobyl is still radioactive, although some residents have returned to their homes.There was a direct loss of $12.6 billion on the economic side. Around 784,320 hectares of land were destroyed, and food production in the area was banned. The disaster also caused significant electrical loss in places like Ukraine.The Xiangshui chemical plant produced chemicals such as pesticides and other organic compounds and has since shut down. Like the other disasters mentioned on this list, the plant ignored waste management and safety regulations warnings. Not only did they choose to ignore them, but there had also been previous fires at this plant.In March 2019, an explosion took place, killing 78 people and destroying buildings nearby. The Xiangshui chemical plant was shut down soon after, and the district faces a property loss of around $100 million. There was also an economic loss of about $284.3 million.The Centralia Mine Disaster is known as the second-worst mining disaster in the US, killing over 100 people. It took place in Centralia, Pennsylvania on 25 March 1947. The disaster started off with the electricity being cut off and thick black smoke surging through the mines. This then led to a large accumulation of smoke and a deadly explosion.Poor safety regulations and coal dust caused this tragic explosion. Out of 142 men, only 31 managed to escape. The mine had received previous warnings about the coal dust that was collecting, but they chose to ignore it.Some economic consequences faced after this disaster were compensation for victims, recovery investments, and safety regulations. According to a report by the UN, there was a temporary decline in coal production after the disaster.The Beirut explosion is one of the most recent industrial disasters caused by an ammonium nitrate explosion in the capital of Lebanon. There were more than 200 deaths and 7000 injuries resulting from the incident which took place in 2020. This explosion was the cause of large amounts of ammonium nitrate that had been stored in a warehouse without proper security measures. Lebanese authorities believe that welding work was what resulted in a fire which then led to the explosion.While some time has passed, Beirut still hasn't recovered from the explosion. Not only did this disaster weaken the local currency and push millions into poverty, but it also wrecked necessary infrastructure like ports. The economic loss caused by this incident was around $15 billion, with $3 billion going into infrastructure restoration. With the port destroyed, there was a lack of exports and imports, which the country relied on.In December 2003, PetroChinas Chuandongbei natural gas field exploded in the municipality of Chongqing, China, killing more than 233 people and injuring over 10,000, putting it sixth on our list of the worst industrial disasters in the world. The blast was at such a catastrophic level that it nearly wiped out an entire village and caused other widespread damages.While there isnt much information about how much PetroChina (HKSE: 0857) paid compensation regarding this case, there most likely would have been rescuing operation costs, property damages, and compensation for blast victims.
risk,The Council of EU member states and the European Parliament agreed on Tuesday (6 February) to label nuclear power as a strategic technology for the EUs decarbonisation, following months of intense negotiations in Brussels over the Net-Zero Industry Act (NZIA).It came in response to the massive US green subsidy programme, the Inflation Reduction Act, as well as long-standing Chinese efforts to become global leaders in the manufacturing of clean technologies like batteries, heat pumps and solar panels.To this end, the NZIA aims to accelerate permitting procedures for industrial production sites involved in the manufacturing of components needed for renewable energy technologies, but also for nuclear power.Meeting in trilogues, negotiators from the Parliament, the Council, and the European Commission confirmed on Tuesday the strategic nature of projects relating to nuclear energy, which are included in a single list of net-zero technologies that will benefit from the NZIA.The text is a mix of the two mandates [adopted by the Council and Parliament], with a more comprehensive list than what was proposed by the member states, explained French MEP Christophe Grudler who took part in the talks for the centrist Renew Europe group in Parliament.The agreement encompasses tried and tested nuclear technologies as well as future third and fourth generation ones, i.e. small modular reactors (SMRs) and advanced nuclear reactors (AMRs). Their fuel cycles are also included in the text.While supporters of nuclear power in France have welcomed plans to scrap the two-tier approach to low-carbon technologies in the EUs draft Net-Zero Industry Act (NZIA), they also condemn the lower status granted to atomic energy as incoherent with the blocs wider decarbonisation goals.Concretely, this means that factories producing components for these technologies will benefit from simplified permitting procedures, with deadlines ranging from 18 to 12 months for bigger projects and 12 to nine months for smaller ones.The situation caused uproar among advocates of nuclear power after European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen publicly insisted that nuclear power was not strategic. In Paris, these were dismissed as unfortunate comments.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen outlined limits to EU backing for nuclear power under the blocs Net-Zero Industry Act, which seeks to support home-made production of clean technologies like batteries and solar panels.After much back and forth, nuclear power was finally included in the single list of 17 technologies proposed in November by the texts rapporteur, German MEP Christian Ehler (European Peoples Party  EPP).
risk,A group of residents of towns near Japanese nuclear plants submitted a petition on Friday asking regulators to halt safety screening for the restart of idled reactors until damage to a plant that partially lost external power and spilled radioactive water during a recent powerful earthquake is fully examined.Two idled reactors at Shika nuclear power plant on the Noto Peninsula in Ishikawa suffered power outages because of damage to transformers. Radioactive water spilled from spent fuel cooling pools and cracks appeared on the ground, but no radiation leaked outside, operator Hokuriku Electric Power Co. said.All Japanese nuclear power plants were temporarily shut down after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster for safety checks under stricter standards. The government is pushing for them to be restarted but the process has been slow, in part because of lingering anti-nuclear sentiment among the public. Twelve of the 33 workable reactors have since restarted.Residents of Ishikawa and other towns with nuclear plants gathered in Tokyo on Friday and handed their petition to officials at the Nuclear Regulation Authority. They are asking officials to freeze the screening process while damage at the Shika nuclear plant is fully examined and safety measures are implemented.Nuclear safety officials have noted that the extensive damage suffered by houses and roads in the area of the Shika plant make current evacuation plans largely unworkable. The damage, including landslides, made many places inaccessible, trapping thousands of people on the narrow peninsula.Takako Nakagaki, a resident of Kanazawa, about 60 kilometers (35 miles) south of the Shika plant, said the current evacuation plan is pie in the sky. Under the plan, residents closer to the plant are advised to stay indoors in case of a radiation leak, but that would be impossible if houses are damaged in an earthquake.The Noto quake also sparked fear in neighboring Fukui prefecture, where seven reactors at three plants have restarted, and in Niigata prefecture, where the operator of the tsunami-hit Fukushima nuclear plant is preparing to restart its only workable nuclear plant, the worlds largest seven-reactor Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant.The Nuclear Regulation Authority has requested a further investigation of the Shika plant, even though initial assessments showed no immediate risk to its cooling functions or outside radiation leaks. NRA officials said Shikas operator should consider the possibility of additional damage to key equipment as aftershocks continue.The Shika reactors, inaugurated in 1993 and 2006, have been offline since the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Hokuriku Electric Power has expressed hopes to restart the newer No. 2 reactor by 2026, but reviews of the recent quake damage could delay that plan.Join us for a webinar on how hair is represented in anime, presented by a teacher from Anime Artist Academy.

The public continues to vote in politicians that support highly centralized energy systems, and apparently are willing to pay for those systems, whose costs increasingly rise. Nuclear power costs are too often hidden and/or fudged; the externalities of nuke power and burning huge amounts of fossil fuels are rarely revealed by those in power. Find ways to assist individual property owners to make their properties more energy efficient, and find ways to generate electricity that are renewable and do as little harm to the environment as possible.

risk,Nuclear fission was once seen as the future. In the early 1960s, politicians and scientists in Germany thought that it would provide an endless supply of electricity, without polluting the air. There was little discussion of the risks of nuclear accidents.Heinz Smital, an atomic energy expert atGreenpeace, told DW that politicians at the time were euphoric: "From the very beginning, nuclear energy benefited from the fact that countries were interested in the technology, because of nuclear weapons. The energy companies weren't interested in getting into nuclear power. The interest came from the national level."Jochen Flasbarth, the current State Secretary in the Ministry of Development, adds: "In the 1960s, Germany was still in 'economic miracle' mode. There was an enormous, almost nave faith in technology."At the time, much of the air in Germany was dirty, and the sky was often clouded with smog, especially in the heavily industrialized western Ruhr region, home to much of the country's steel and coal industry. Coal-burning power plants were a significant source of electricity. Nuclear energy was a clear alternative, promising "clean" energy.Similar thinking took hold in the former East Germany, where the first commercial nuclear power plant went online in 1961. It was a time of confidence in the technology on both sides of the Iron Curtain. In the following years, a total of 37 nuclear reactors went into operation in Germany.Attitudes changed in the 1970s. Protesters from the growing environmentalist movement demonstrated at the construction sites of new power plants. "The anti-nuclear movement emerged in part as a protest by young people against their largely apolitical parents," says Jochen Flasbarth. "This culminated in big anti-nuclear demonstrations."In 1979, the Three Mile Island power plant in the US suffered the world's worst nuclear accident at the time, narrowly averting a nuclear disaster. Steffi Lemke of the Green Party, the current Federal Environment Minister, says, "Nuclear euphoria increasingly gave way to the realization that nuclear energy is not something [we can] control."Then came the Chernobyl accident, in Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union. On April 26, 1986, a reactor meltdown set a major nuclear accident in motion. The area is still contaminated  and the political fallout continues to this day.Chernobyl contributed to growing skepticism about nuclear energy in Germany. "The construction of power plants collapsed after that. There were plans for 60 nuclear power plants in Germany alone," said Heinz Smital of Greenpeace.In 1980, the Green Party emerged from the anti-nuclear movement. Shutting down nuclear reactors was a core part of its program. In 1983, the party entered the Bundestag. In 1998, the Greens became part of a governing coalition for the first time, joining the Social Democrats (SPD). The two parties moved to phase out nuclear energy, against fierce resistance from the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU), who later called for a "phase-out of the phase-out.Since then, the CDU and CSU have changed their position on nuclear power again. Now many in the party are calling for new reactors to be built. CDU leaderFriedrich Merz has said that shutting down the last reactors was a "black day for Germany."The parties also say that old reactors should be reconnected to the grid. Merz says that the country should restart the last three power plants that were shut down  citing climate protection, as well as rising oil and gas prices.Environment Minister Steffi Lemke is not surprised. "The energy companies made adjustments a long time ago, and they still reject nuclear power in Germany today. Nuclear power is a high-risk technology whose radioactive waste will continue to be toxic for thousands of years, and will be an issue for many generations."There are currently 412 reactors in use worldwide, spread across 32 countries. Even as new reactors are built, older ones are shut down, so the overall number has remained more or less constant for years. Countries such as China, France and the UK have announced new construction. Others want to build small, modern reactors.According to Greenpeace's Smital, the small reactors are focused on military use, rather than energy production. "One of them is in North Korea. It produces the fuel for the country's whole nuclear weapons program. Economic efficiency is not the point. I see a great danger in these small, often mobile reactors."The authorities have to look for suitable sites, make selections and commission test drillings. Local communities, who don't want nuclear waste buried anywhere near them, often resist. And figuring out costs and timelines is difficult."I can't estimate any of this at the moment," says Dagmar Dehmer of the government's nuclear waste disposal agency. "We have to look at several regions. Drilling costs millions. The evaluation alone costs about five million euros."Environment Minister Lemke believes economic viability will decide. "No power company would build a nuclear plant in Germany, because the costs would be far too high. Nuclear power plants can only be built with massive public and hidden subsidies, including partial exemption from insurance requirements."
risk,So far this week, spot prices for yellowcake - uranium concentrate used in nuclear power generation - reached a new 16-year high, climbing to $92.45 per pound. Reflecting on our December 2020 note to readers in "Buy Uranium: Is This The Beginning Of The Next ESG Craze," yellowcake prices have risen 217%.BofA's metals and mining team said tightness in uranium markets could extend well into 2025, indicating that prices could run higher through this year. The team of analysts has increased their uranium spot price price targets to $105 per pound in 2024 and $115 in 2025.On a separate note, Berenberg analysts said the requirement for some uranium users to diversify away from Russian supply could be a major price driver. They said prices will likely normalize around $70 per pound for the long term.Soaring prices have buoyed stocks of mining companies like Cameco up nearly 300% since December 2020. The Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM is also up almost 300%. And supplier Uranium Energy Corp is up 416%.

risk,South Korea plans to build the world's largest semiconductor cluster in Gyeonggi Province by investing around $470 billion (430 billion) over the next 23 years into the massive production park in partnership with major electronics companies Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix.To support the plan, the government has proposed measures including tax incentives for investments and initiatives to boost competitiveness. South Korea aims to increase self-sufficiency in essential materials, parts, and equipment for chip production to 50% by 2030.South Korea currently dominates the production of DRAM and NAND memory chips, which are used for managing and storing data on devices on PCs, smartphones and SD cards, holding a global market share of over 60%. South Korea aims to increase its share of other chips and processors.Samsung also seeks to overtake the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSMC) leading position producing wafers, which are thin disks made up of semiconducting material, mainly silicon, that act as the first layer in creating semiconductor components.President Yoon Suk-yeol has said that the ambitious "mega cluster" is expected to generate nearly 3.5 million jobs. To achieve this, he emphasized the necessity of expanding nuclear energy to meet the energy demands of the semiconductor sector.A semiconductor "cluster" is a group of facilities that perform research and all production steps of semiconductors all in a single area. South Korea's cluster comprises various industrial zones in the province of Gyeonggi, with a total area of 21,000 hectares (52,000 acres), which is 21 million square meters, or the size of almost 30,000 soccer fields."If we complete the construction of the semiconductor mega cluster at an earlier date, we will achieve the world's leading competitiveness in the chip sector and provide quality jobs for young generations," said trade and industry minister Ahn Duk-geun.Samsung Electronics is set to invest 500 trillion won ($375 billion) in the project, allocating 360 trillion won for six new production facilities in Yongin, located 33 kilometers (20 miles) south of Seoul.Additionally, 120 trillion won will be directed towards building three new factories in the Pyeongtaek production complex, situated 54 kilometers south of Seoul, along with three research factories in Giheung.South Korea sees its chip industry at risk of losing importance in the power struggle between China and the USA. In 2022, South Korea exported semiconductor goods worth $129 billion, which accounted for around 19% of national exports.A reduction in national production would hit South Korea's economy hard. "Korea is at the forefront of semiconductors, which creates economic opportunities but also makes companies vulnerable," said Troy Stangarone from the Korea Economic Institute in Washington.The US is promoting the establishment of semiconductor production facilities with subsidies of $52.7 billion with the "CHIPS and Science Act." This is why Samsung is building a $17 billion chip plant in the US state of Texas.At the same time, a new cluster of TSMC and Sony processor plants is being built on the main Japanese island of Kyushu. Meanwhile, OpenAI boss Sam Altmann is looking for producers of chips for the development and application of artificial intelligence.Thanks to an indefinite special permit, South Korean manufacturers have so far been exempt from US restrictions and are allowed to export equipment and machinery to China. The Samsung plant for NAND memory chips in Xian and SK Hynix's NAND factory in Dalian benefit from this.However, South Korean doubts about production in China are growing. On January 24, SK Hynix had to deny again that it was planning to sell the plant in Dalian, which it had only taken over from Intel for $9 billion in December 2020.According to market researcher Bloomberg Intelligence, the US controls five of the ten stages of the chip supply and production chain, including etching, coating and doping, while Japan and the Netherlands control the remaining areas, such as wafer cleaning and lithography.Thus, South Korea's key role as a chip manufacturer depends on technologies, materials and expertise mainly belonging to the US and its allies. South Korean manufacturers are therefore focusing on cooperation with US companies to strengthen their national production.
risk,In late 2022, U.S. industrial leader Dow Inc partnered with Rockville, Maryland-based advanced nuclear developer X-energy to demonstrate a high-temperature gas reactor (HTGR) for industrial decarbonization. Dow, with $57 billion in annual net sales, has a stated objective of carbon neutrality along its entire value chain by 2050. The Dow X-energy nuclear cogeneration project, at the Seadrift facility in Texas, is part of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)'s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program, which seeks to de-risk advanced reactors through cost-shared partnerships with private industry. Having begun in 2021, ARDP plans to invest $1.23 billion in this project over seven years.Dows vision is to eventually produce zero-carbon plastic, as the need for such solutions is growing. For example, after two years of research, Danish toymaker Lego recently determined that recycling plastic bottles into toy bricks would increase GHG emissions. As society starts to account for the embedded carbon content of various products, Dow aims to realize premium pricing by selling low-carbon plastic. Dow had a Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG footprint of 31.5 million tonnes CO2e in 2022, from 104 manufacturing facilities across 31 countries.Dows Seadrift is the companys second largest facility in Texas, spanning 4,700 acres and employing more than 1,200 people in Calhoun County. Seadrift annually produces 1,816 tonnes of material for food packaging and preservation, footwear, wire and cable insulation, solar cell membranes, and packaging for medical and pharmaceutical products. Co-locating a nuclear cogeneration plant at this energy consumer facility allows for the efficient utilization of produced heat.Proponents of the Seadrift project estimate that nuclear repowering will reduce annual GHG emissions by 440,000 tonnes CO2e, totaling 1.4% of Dows Scope 1 and 2 corporate emissions. The Seadrift site currently uses combined cycle gas steam turbines with 156 MWe capacity. Installed in 2000, this cogeneration asset is nearing scheduled retirement age by 2030, when it will be replaced with nuclear. Construction is planned to start in 2026.The Xe-100 reactor can provide 80 megawatts of electric power (MWe) from 200 MW of thermal output (MWth), and is expected have a 60-year operational life. The Xe-100 also can deliver high-temperature steam of 565C to serve a variety of industries including mining, chemical production, and petroleum refining. Four Xe-100 reactors will be deployed on a 26-acre footprint at Seadrift. Reliability is of paramount concern to Dow; the facility has not had an unplanned steam outage since 1987. While Seadrift needs only 100 MWe electricity plus 200 MWth heat, Dow is purchasing four reactors to accommodate for planned and unplanned maintenance, plus backup. In the future, Dow aims to both expand Seadrift operations and sell excess carbon-free power to the grid. In September 2023, the Public Utility Commission of Texas established the Texas Advanced Nuclear Reactor Working Group to study advances in this technology, the supply chain development, and the changes needed the electric grid operator.Dow is an optimal industrial leader to pioneer U.S. nuclear cogeneration. The company is well regarded for its operational excellence in cogeneration. Energy accounts for a large part of the companys costs, and Dow attracts and retains the expertise necessary to see complicated projects through. In November 2023, Dow embarked on building the worlds first Scope 1 and 2 net-zero ethylene and derivatives complex at Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta. The $6.5 billion Path2Zero investment project aims to use air separation and autothermal reforming to convert the sites cracker off-gas to hydrogen and also capture and store 1 million tonnes of CO2 emissions.Chopping, D.

The vendor hasn't submitted the design license request yet, but is in pre-licensing engagement. In December 2023, NRC approved Kairos Power's 35 MW molten salt rest reactor within 18 months. This was the first high-temp license reactor license approved since 1968. In July 2023, Kairos also submitted an approval request for Hermes 2, a two-unit demonstration plant at the same site. Hermes 2 is expected to be operational in 2028.3) While solar thermal generates heat, solar PV and wind do not. Generating heat through electricity is extremely inefficient and expensive (especially at the temperatures required at facilities such as this). Adding storage to operate to this would diminish any economic viability beyond that. Dow requires 99.7% uptime for process steam for the Seadrift plant.If you have an experience or insight to share or have learned something from a conference or seminar, your peers and colleagues on Energy Central want to hear about it.

safe,Even as Russia remains under unprecedented Western economic sanctions, the U.S. finds itself dependent on one Russian vital import: enriched uranium. The U.S. is the largest producer of nuclear energy in the world, but it has allowed its civilian nuclear infrastructure to languish since Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagans presidencies in the 1970s and 1980s.While the U.S. has coasted on its laurels, with nuclear energy production not changing much in over 30 years, Russia continues its gradual climb upward and exports many reactors, while China is investing heavily in civilian nuclear tech and boosting its atomic power generation at home. Beijing plans to build 24 new nuclear power plants by 2030, bringing the total up to 60, overtaking the U.S. with its old reactor fleet. For comparison, the U.S. has 93 operational nuclear power plants in total, and in the same period as Chinas building spree, the U.S. added 2 with none under development now.This decline is by choice. The U.S. certainly used to have the technical and financial resources to compete with Russia and China in these fields, but the political will to pursue nuclear power (despite its overwhelmingly green characteristics (zero CO2 emissions, and its exemplary safety record in North America) has been lacking. The notorious Three Mile Island accident in 1979, killed, injured, irradiated, or harmed zero people. Meanwhile, ballooning costs and the nightmare that is Americas byzantine environmental review and permitting processes resulted in the last nuclear power plant arriving 7 years late and 17 billion dollars over budget. Its little surprise the U.S. is falling behind in many nuclear areas. A generation of Americans were scared by Three Mile Island, and the nuclear industry became a political and environmental target, said Jack Edlow of Edlow International, a company that specializes in the global transportation of nuclear materials and has been in the nuclear industry for 55 years.The average age of a nuclear reactor in the U.S. is 40 years old, meaning Russia and China have been able to take advantage of (often American) research into better reactors. The emerging technology of Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and advanced generation four reactors are being embraced far quicker in China and Russia than in the U.S.SMRs are a popular option to advance clean and safe production, as they address multiple concerns about nuclear power. The ease of assembly and transport of SMRs changes the construction of a reactor from a multi-billion dollar, multi-year process into a shorter and cheaper endeavor with timelier returns. SMRs also lower environmental risks due to their anticipated reduced rate of accidents and lack of meltdown potential due to innovative technology. Additionally, environmental and aesthetic concerns are addressed by the ability of SMRs to be placed in remote areas, or underground. Despite the promise of SMRs and platitudes from the DOE on the subject, investments in SMRs lag far behind what is needed.Even with an updated fleet of reactors, the United States would still be falling behind Russia in its supply of high-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU), which is enriched up to 20% compared to the average 5% of uranium used in current reactors to allow more efficient units to function. The commercial supply of HALEU is currently controlled by TENEX, a division of the state-owned Russian nuclear energy company Rosatom. To bolster Americas domestic production, the Biden administration has put out an RFP for HALEU enrichment. The process of building a domestic supply will be difficult to jumpstart with only one U.S. company, Centrus Energy, being licensed to refine HALEU and one European company, Urenco, planning to start production in New Mexico. The RFP will allow many companies other than CENTRUS to bid for the new plant operation but operation is not likely to occur until the late 2020s.Building a new reactor is uniquely difficult in the United States due to its own self-imposed bureaucratic straight jacket. It takes an average 3.2 years to generate an environmental impact statement (EIS) for a new reactor  that is generate, not process. There are then years of additional Nuclear Regulatory Commission hearings to officially license any project. None of these concern safety  safety inspections occur independently of this process and largely function as designed, lasting only months. Then, years of public hearings susceptible and often systematically captured by private interests and militant environmentalists further delays construction, forcing the U.S. to burn coal and natural gas instead of the clean atom.What was once introduced to prevent government planners from running roughshod over communities has become a tool of privileged interests to block construction. This over-regulation does not protect the environment and deters private investment in green energy.All these problems stem from a lack of political will. Thankfully, the U.S. does seem to be slowly entering into a new chapter and re-embracing nuclear power. The Biden administration, in its pursuit of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50% from 2005 levels by 2030, has embraced nuclear energy with 6 billion dollars in aid going to the industry. This is not enough, as 62 billion dollars were allocated to renewables, especially solar and wind, but it is a good start. Congress needs to take a positive stand and vote on the requested funds to provide fuel development in the US. If it is serious, they need to act immediately.In December 2023, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a motion to ban U.S. uranium imports from Russia even though we do not have the capacity within the US to meet our own demand. American companies are on the technical edge of nuclear power, such as NuScale Powers research into SMRs. Technology like that which NuScale proposes may be more expensive than anticipated, however, with significant price increases hindering the progress of planned projects.Decades of bipartisan policy failure will not be reversed with a deluge of legislation. A bipartisan consensus and presidential leadership are desperately needed for the vitally necessary American nuclear renaissance. To ensure the U.S. keeps its leading nuclear edge while maintaining its green energy ambitions, the U.S. needs to rediscover civilian nuclear power, support new generation of reactor designs, and streamline permitting and environmental review procedures. Unless it does so, no amount of laudable single-time subsidies will fix the decades -long morass that is U.S. nuclear energy. We need to launch the new era of Atoms for Peace, and the US must lead this effort concluded Jack Edlow. The time is now
safe,The world is currently in the process of reevaluating its past rejection of nuclear power and is increasingly starting to view it as a reliable source of power that allows for greater energy security. This is at least in part due to the energy crisis that befell Europe after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, vindicating past worries that over-reliance on fossil fuels from autocratic regimes has made the Western countries vulnerable to political blackmail.It is now clear that Western use of natural gas and petroleum from aggressive dictatorshipswhich use cash flows from oil and gas sales to reinforce and expand their hold on powerhas backfired badly. In this context, the experience of Armeniaa small country that draws 40 percent of its energy from nuclear poweris instructive, showing how nuclear power can be instrumental in building societal reliance and political stability.Living in the dark cold. It is the winter of 19921993. As I climb the dark stairs in a freezing-cold Soviet apartment building in Yerevan, the capital of Armenia where my family and I live, the water from the two full buckets I carry is splashing down my legs and freezing on the stairs. My sister Shooshan and I, 14 and 15, are carrying water up to our 11th-floor apartment. The water to our apartment shut off weeks ago, and we get at most one hour of electricity each day. I estimate that we need exactly seven gallons of water, if we are careful, for our basic daily needs. So, we repeat the trip every day. During the precious hour when we do get electricity, my mother rushes to the kitchen to cook food for the next 24 hours. I run to the bakery, where I stand in a long queue to buy the half pound of bread that the state has rationed for each one of us.The daily routine, which goes on for the whole winter, is exhausting. But it is also empowering. As teenagers we feel that we are stronger than the disastrous conditions inflicted on us by the combination of the Soviet collapse, the Nagorno-Karabakh war, and the ensuing severe energy crisis.The reasons that my sister and Iand the thousands of other Armenian teenagers like ushad to lug water and plan their lives around the one hour of electricity during that cruel winter go back to the turbulent events that shook Armenia during the preceding decades.In the 1970s and 1980s, the Soviet Unionwhich Armenia was part ofrapidly expanded its fleet of nuclear reactors to support its growing industrial energy needs. As a result, two pressurized water reactors (PWR) of the Soviet VVER-440 type were built in the Armenian town of Metsamor, about 30 kilometers west of Yerevan. Started in 1977 and 1980, respectively, the two reactors quickly covered more than half of the energy needs of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. (The remainder of the electricity was generated by Armenias hydroelectric stations and gas-fired power plants.) The Armenia of the 1980s was a tiny but prosperous Soviet republic that prided itself in a highly educated labor force, an array of scientific institutes, and a vibrant electronics industry that produced some of the early Soviet computer mainframe designs.Chernobyl. On April 26, 1986, one of the Soviet-designed, graphite-moderated RBMK reactors at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant underwent a catastrophic power excursion that ripped the reactor open. The explosion and fire that followed propelled an enormous amount of radioactive matter into the open atmosphere leading to what is now known as the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, with widespread radioactive contamination, hundreds of deaths from acute radiation poisoning, and likely thousands of additional deaths due to radiation-induced cancers in the months and years that followed.The Chernobyl accident resonated worldwide, dramatically undermining public trust in nuclear power as a safe source of energy. The public perception of danger from nuclear power was magnified by the outrageous lies that the Soviet leadership spread about the disaster, the obvious incompetence and irresponsibility of the Soviet nuclear designers who built and operated the Chernobyl reactor, and the poorly executed cleanup efforts which were compounded by miscalculations and gross mistakes.Overnight, citizens across the Soviet Union and beyond went from a blissful ignorance about radiation to an understandableyet irrationalfear of anything radiation-related. People in Armenia, despite living more than 2,000 kilometers away from Chernobyl, started perceiving radioactive threats everywhere, often attributing many of their common ailments to radiation. Physicists, like my parents, tried to explain what radiation is and how natural doses of radiation are not dangerous. But their advice was sometimes met with hostility: Werent the builders of Chernobyl also scientists?In one chilling conversation that I witnessed at a dinner party, one of the guests told my father only half in jest, You physicists you should all be shot! To paraphrase Valery Legasovs eponymous character from HBOs five-part mini-series Chernobyl: The danger of the lies is not that we mistake them for the truth, but that when enough lies are told we lose hope in the truth and start believing in stories. (Legasov was a Soviet chemist who actively worked on the causes and consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. Concerned by the lack of nuclear safety in the Soviet nuclear industry, he died by suicide on April 27, 1988.)An earthquake, the Soviet collapse, and war. In December 1988, the devastating earthquake of Spitak killed 50,000 peoplea harrowing 2 percent of Armenias populationand destroyed most of the countrys infrastructure. The two VVER-440 reactors at Metsamor were suddenly in the public eye. Would another earthquake rip them open and turn Armenias heartland, where half of Armenias population lived, into a Chernobyl-like radioactive wasteland?To be clear, the PWRs at Metsamor are safer than the shoddily designed, graphite-moderated reactors at Chernobyl. Metsamors Soviet reactor design is close to the standard PWR designs that are still the most common reactor technology used in Western countries. And the buildings and the reactor structures were reinforced to account for Armenias seismic activity. But none of that mattered. After the Soviet governments grotesque lies about the Chernobyl disaster, the official assurances that the Metsamor reactors were safe did not convince many. Legasovs intuition was right: The pursuit for truth was replaced with belief in conspiratorial rumors. An environmentalist movement sprang up, calling for the shutdown of the Metsamor reactors. The authorities backed down, and the two reactors were turned off on February 25 and March 18, 1989.Shortly after the shutdown, the Soviet Union started to crack, finally collapsing in 1991. In neighboring Azerbaijan, an Armenian minority living in the mountainous Nagorno-Karabakh region, feeling marginalized and discriminated against, had long been fighting to protect their civil rights. With the weakening of Soviet power, the protest movement turned into demands for secession from Azerbaijan. The response in Azerbaijan was a series of brutal anti-Armenian pogroms in the cities of Sumgait and Baku that killed hundreds of Armenian civilians and forced about 300,000 others to flee the country. Fearing retaliation, the Azeri civilians living in Armenia fled en masse to Azerbaijan.A relatively peaceful political disagreement had suddenly turned into a violent conflict, with Azerbaijans pogroms against Armenians escalating to a total war against the Armenian people of Nagorno-Karabakh. As the Armenian government supported the Nagorno-Karabakh secessionists, Azerbaijan retaliated by shutting off some of the natural gas pipelines that led to Armenia. In a sense, Azerbaijans authorities did to Armenia what Russian President Vladimir Putin is now doing to Western European countries that support Ukraines war effort. With its nuclear reactors and natural gas supply shut down, Armenia was left with a reduced capacity to generate electricity.Then came the winter of 19921993. Mountain rivers froze, hydroelectric dams dried up, and suddenly hydropower too was nearly gone. Armenia was getting barely a trickle of electricity. What followed is a period now known in Armenia as tsurt u mut tariner, literally the cold and dark years: severe shortages of electricity, freezing concrete apartment complexes, closed schools, and many other disruptions. The economy collapsed, with Armenias gross domestic product contracting by an estimated 50 to 80 percent between 1990 and 1993. Then, a massive exodus followed, shrinking Armenias population by a quarter in just a few years.Nuclear power revival. The Armenian public quickly realized that, by abandoning nuclear power, it had forfeited the countrys energy independence. That vulnerability wasand still isvery effectively leveraged by its arch-enemy Azerbaijan. Was it too late to restore nuclear power?Understanding their mistake, the Armenian authorities re-evaluated their past decision. The choice was stark: Either indulge in exaggerated fears of radiation and face unpredictable consequences, or sober up and accept nuclear power as a lesser evil. Ultimately the government chose the sober option. But rather than rushing headfirst to hastily restart the Metsamor nuclear power plant, the authorities decided to make significant safety improvements to the reactors.One of the Metsamor reactors finally restarted on November 5, 1995, just before the winter season. The desperately needed 400 megawatts flowed again into the small countrys languishing power grid. Almost overnight, lights were turned on, water pumps worked again, and industries revved up to capacity. Children like my sister and I stopped their exhausting routine and Armenia became a net exporter of electricity.Over the 13 years that followed, Armenias economy grew by an unprecedented 700 percent. The difficult decision to restore nuclear power had saved Armenia and had put it on a path of development. In 2020, about 35 percent of electricity generated in Armenia came from nuclear, 25 percent came from renewables (primarily hydropower), and the remaining 40 percent from fossil fuels. (In 2021, the share of nuclear power temporarily dropped to 26 percent because the Metsamor reactor was shut down longer than usual to perform a thermal annealing of the pressure vessel, a maintenance method aimed at managing aging effects.)Despite its important contribution to the electricity mix, the nuclear power plant at Metsamor is not without problems. Mainly, like most Soviet-era PWRs, the reactor does not have the external containment building that is common with Western designs. It is also an aging machine. Because of Armenias growing energy needs, the Metsamor reactor has been issued multiple lifetime extensions. Based on current plans, Metsamors VVER-440 reactor will shut down permanently by 2036. Meanwhile the Armenian government has been busy exploring replacement alternatives, such as possibly US-built small modular reactors (SMRs), seen as a viable replacement. Armenian officials have also entered in discussions with Russia about the possibility of replacing the Soviet-era VVER-440 reactor with the much larger and more modern Russian VVER-1200 design. While the US option is not easymainly because of the lack of readiness of most SMR designsthe Russian option is particularly fraught. Armenia is reluctant to further increase its energy dependence on Russia, given Putins campaign of neo-Soviet expansionism. This is further exacerbated by the technical and economic difficulty of hosting a 1200-megawatt electric VVER-1200 unit on a grid that on average consumes only about 1,000 megawatts.Survival in the shadow of petro-dictatorship. In recent years, social scientists have studied the negative impacts of nuclear power on underprivileged communities, such as the effects of uranium mining on indigenous populations. These studies are important for understanding the social cost of this resource. However very rarely have scholars studied the positive impact that nuclear power has had in helping the victims of oppression.Most of the three million inhabitants in Armenia trace their lineage to the survivors of the Armenian Genocide of 1915. Most live near the border with the perpetrator state of Turkey, which to this day refuses to acknowledge its crime and in the recent past has actively helped Azerbaijan. Since 1993, Azerbaijan has been ruled by the Aliyev dynasty with an iron fist, strengthened by the cash flows from the export of the countrys large hydrocarbon reserves to Western countries. To further strengthen his hold on power, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev (son of Heydar Aliyev who held power in Azerbaijan for several decades) has tapped into Azerbaijanis trauma from the 1990s by demonizing Armenians and blaming all of Azerbaijans ill on this minority.Since he took power in 2003, the regime of Aliyev son has been accused of curtailing free speech and ethnic cleansing of Armenians, whereas Azerbaijans armed forces have been busy mounting a campaign of widespread cultural erasure. These decades of threats culminated in last September with a swift military attack on the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which in just one week brought the 3,000-year-old indigenous Armenian presence there effectively to an end. The situation currently is so severe that Luis Moreno Ocampo, a former chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, has warned that a new genocide may be underway.Armenians, whose newly budding democracy is under constant threat from the various authoritarian governments in the region, cannot achieve cultural and existential security if they do not have a state that ensures their security. And that includes energy security, to which nuclear power generation is key. Of course, Azerbaijan deserves to have a democratic government, too, something that is being hindered by the Western countries over-reliance on fossil fuel exports.The lessons of small nations. When it comes to understanding the value of nuclear energy, studies tend to focus on the big nuclear powers such as the United States, China, and Russia. They rarely study the experiences of small countries like Armenia. Still, the study of these insignificant players is important in terms of understanding the mistakes made, successes achieved, and lessons learned, which can be relevant for the big players as well. In a telling example, Germany is learning the hard way about the dangers of complacency when it comes to choosing between nuclear energy and fossil fuels for its energy mix: Over the last 20 years, German politicians preferred to shut down their scarybut nonetheless safenuclear power plants and increase their potentially destabilizingbut considered harmlessreliance on Russias natural gas. Had German policymakers studied Armenias experience of the 1990s, they could probably have avoided the energy crisis the country is currently experiencing.Sadly, its hard to tell whether European leaders have learned anything from Armenias struggle for energy security. In a now much-criticized statement from 2022, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called Azerbaijans dictator Ilham Aliyev a reliable partner. This gesture is now believed to have, at least partly, emboldened the Aliyev regimes brutality toward the Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh. At least for now, it is as if Europe is merely switching dictators while maintaining the same dependence on fossil fuels.Only a full reckoning by Western countries of their over-reliance on fossil fuels can put an end to the authoritarian regimes that exist only because of their hydrocarbon exports. Such a reckoning, along with the development of renewable energy and nuclear power, would lead to net gains for the climate and the environment. It would also help strengthen liberal democracies that are being unprecedently threatened.The Bulletin elevates expert voices above the noise.

I would love to visit my parents home country some day, and tour our nuclear facilities as a partner and advocate myself.Thank you for the article, indeed those years without electricity had a huge negative impact not only economical but also social and psychological. I would like also to note a historical error in the article  Armenians were living in the Autonomous Oblast of Nagorno-Karabakh, there was no such thing as region.Thank you very much for this personal and national story. Its an important addition to what many people know, and some of us who teach should use it in any related courses (I certainly will). At the same time, your numbers for mortality and cancer incidence from the Chernobyl accident are much larger than those published by the Chernobyl Forum, the most detailed and long-term source of analyses.

safe,Betavolt Technology claims to have successfully miniaturized atomic energy batteries, which measure less than a coin at 15 x 15 x 5mm. The compact battery usesthe radioactive isotope Nickel 63 to generate 100 microwatts and a voltage of 3V of electricity through the process of radioactive decay.The battery is currently in the pilot testing stage and Betavolt plans to mass-produce them for commercial devices like phones and drones, but also states nuclear batteries could be used for aerospace equipment, AI, medical equipment, advanced sensors, and micro-robots. The Beijing-based company claims to have drawn inspiration from devices such as pacemakers, and satellites.Betavolt is planning to boost its tech to produce a 1-watt battery by 2025. And while it still has some way to go, the company seems confident stating development is way ahead of European and American scientific research institutions and enterprises.This technology could revolutionize electronics by removing the need for chargers or portable power banks altogether creating devices that run continuously and whose batteries do not degrade in terms of capacity and lifespan over charging cycles in the way Li-ion batteries do.It could even prove to be safer too, as Betavolt states that the BV100 will not catch fire or explode in response to punctures or even gunshots, unlike some current batteries that can be unsafe if damaged or when exposed to high temperatures.Currently nuclear batteries are used for spacecraft, underwater systems, automated scientific stations as well as crafts like the Mars rover, but they are large, heavy, and generate a lot of heat, as well as being expensive. However, Betavolt states that it uses a different approach.Betavolt claims the advantages of its atomic energy batteries are their lightweight, feature a long service life, as well as feature high energy density, and can work normally under extreme temperatures from -60 to 120-degrees Celcius.Understandably most people wouldnt want to carry nuclear material in their pocket; particular not viewers of HBO's fantastic but chilling Chernobyl series. Many could be hesitant to adopt the widespread use of nuclear batteries due to the negative connotations of nuclear tragedies like the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 or the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011.However, the Betavolt also addressed the concerns about radiation, stating the battery is safe as it has no external radiation and is suitable for use in medical devices inside the human body like pacemakers and cochlea implants.While it sounds like something from 1950s science fiction this technology could change the face of electronics by providing unwired, always-on devices that could be spell a new revolution in nuclear energy use.He is almost the textbook definition of a geek, who loves sci-fi, comics, games and of course, all things tech.

safe,Nuclear energy was an unexpected winner at COP28, the United Nations global climate conference that recently concluded in the United Arab Emirates. More than 24 countries, including the United States, and 120 companies committed to tripling nuclear energy by 2050 as an essential part of mitigating climate change. The principal goal is carbon-free energy available 24/7 as an essential complement to variable wind and solar electricity. After years of skepticism, there is growing political momentum for nuclear energy, but if countries follow the current model of plant construction, they will not get where they have pledged to go. The world needs a new strategy for nuclear energy deployment that furthers climate goals, enhances grid reliability, and ensures that achieving energy security doesnt erode global security.To make good on the COP pledge, accounting for a ramp-up time, the world will soon need to build the equivalent of about 50 large nuclear power reactors per year until 2050. This is two-thirds more than were built at nuclear powers peak in the early 1980s, and the current pace of construction is well short of that.Seventeen countries are building just one or two reactors at a time, each sometimes taking over a decade to build. In the West, nuclear construction projects are often long, complex, and characterized by delays and cost over-runs. Regulatory uncertainty and long timelines discourage investment. China, Russia, South Korea, and now the UAE have demonstrated the ability to build new nuclear reactors effectively, but this alone is clearly insufficient. Newcomer nuclear countries like Poland, Ghana, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines are looking to deploy domestically, but it will take time and considerable resources to meet simultaneously their project management, regulatory, security, finance and workforce ambitions.To succeed, nations must rethink how to build, regulate, and finance nuclear technology. The United States offers a case in point. The second of two new-build gigawatt-scale nuclear reactors in Georgia is showing the immense value of learning from experience, but there arent any other projects in the pipeline to take advantage of those lessons learned. The next US nuclear build will likely need to go back to basics without the benefits of an experienced workforce as technology evolves and schedules from commitment to operation extend well over a decade.A new system will need to deliver standardized products rather than costly and risky one-off multi-decade projects. This could mean relying on proven designs of gigawatt-scale reactors, or embracing a selection of new smaller designs amenable to assembly-line methods (analogous to those in the airline and shipbuilding industries), or some combination of both. Many countries, including the United States, have expressed strong interest in small modular reactors, but the reality is that little progress is being made.It will require groups of customers of zero-carbon always-available electricity  utilities, large industrial users, large IT companies  to agree to purchase electricity or heat from dozens of nuclear plants of the same design. This so-called orderbook approach, common in the aviation industry, would address many flaws of the current model by sending a durable demand signal to the nuclear supply chain, pooling resources, and unlocking workforce development, thereby reducing risks and costs. With each new reactor built, countries, companies, investors, and policy makers also learn more, saving time and money.Public-private partnerships will probably be needed to implement this vision. Governments can help motivate the parties by offering financial risk backstops that could provide further confidence to private-sector developers, lowering first-of-a-kind risks. But more may be needed to launch a true nuclear renaissance, since nuclear construction is capital intensive. Especially for countries launching new nuclear programs, multilateral banks such as the World Bank and European Investment Bank must rebuild their nuclear finance capabilities and provide necessary capital to support the formation of orderbook transactions; new multilateral facilities might be considered as well.In addition, the current process for certifying nuclear reactor designs is based on an inefficient country-by-country approach. Developing an international body charged with issuing a single globally accepted generic certification for reactor designs would further lower the barriers to nuclear deployment. Nuclear can look to the aviation industrys model, which certifies aircraft, subject to strict and uniform standards, across countries.Current geopolitical tensions in Europe and in the Middle East reinforce the importance of scaling up in a way that maintains strong nuclear nonproliferation and security standards. If greater energy security leads to more nuclear weapons, the nuclear energy enterprise will be compromised. Countries can meet these standards by tried and true practices of allowing international monitoring, relying on the international market for fuel rather than enriching their own, and avoiding weapons-usable materials as fuel. New approaches to transparency and verification can simultaneously alleviate concerns and free up unfettered international assistance.Countries dont need to wait to get started. The organization charged with ensuring the safe, secure, and peaceful uses of nuclear energy, the International Atomic Energy Agency, is convening heads of state in Brussels in March to focus on expanding nuclear energy. This presents an important opportunity to begin putting the pieces of the plan outlined here in place. Countries should come ready to support the formation of orderbooks for specific nuclear reactor designs. Leaders should also lay the groundwork for enhanced regional and international institutions focusing on regulatory standardization, financial support, and workforce development.While each country will need to pursue its own individual pathway to nuclear energy, its essential the international community collectively reforms the system to enable success. Having recognized the need to expand nuclear energy, countries must now focus on cooperative implementation and work together to create the conditions for sustained scale-up of this important climate and energy security solution.Ernest J.

safe,On a windy day last August, President Joe Biden signed a proclamation protecting the canyons, cliffs, and plateaus surrounding the Grand Canyon National Park, nearly a million acres abutting the Navajo Nation and Havasupai Indian Reservation.Biden said the new national monument was part of his commitment to Native peoples to protect their sacred lands. Preserving the Grand Canyon as a national park was used to deny Indigenous people full access to their homelands, Biden acknowledged.To Carletta Tilousi, one of the leaders of the Havasupai Tribe who have called the Grand Canyon home for more than 800 years, Bidens presence and his words felt momentous. Finally, the small voices of Indigenous people have been heard in the White House, she thought.But she knew the fight was not over. The monument prevented hundreds of mining claims, but two uranium mines were grandfathered in, in part due to an 1872 law that guaranteed their right to operate. And now, nearly 40 years after first gaining permission to extract uranium, a Colorado-based company is cashing in.The companys decision was influenced by favorable federal policies supporting nuclear energy, high prices for uranium ore, and greater demand for domestic nuclear fuel. The U.S. purchased 12 percent of its uranium from Russia in 2022, and theres growing political pressure to stop those imports in the face of Russias war against Ukraine.    The 17-acre Pinyon Plain Mine is 12 miles from the Grand Canyon, six miles from the Grand Canyon National Park, and four miles north of Red Butte, a site sacred to the Havasupai people where Biden gave his August address. The Havasupai Tribe sued along with environmental groups to prevent the mine from starting production, but lost its case in 2022.Energy Fuels plans to operate the mine for three years to six years and estimates that it will generate 2 million pounds of uranium, says Curtis Moore, senior vice president of marketing and corporate development.After mining operations are complete, the Pinyon Plain area will be fully reclaimed and returned to its natural state, the company has promised. There will be virtually no evidence a mine ever occupied the site.Amber Reimondo is doubtful. Shes energy director at the Grand Canyon Trust, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting the Grand Canyon and the Colorado Plateau that sued to prevent the mine along with the Havasupai Tribe, and says uranium mining threatens the aquifer in the greater Grand Canyon area.According to Reimondo, water systems in the landscape are complex and interconnected. Energy Fuels mining process involves drilling a mine shaft through shallow aquifers into uranium deposits, and water flows into the shaft, mixing with the ore, before being pumped out. The concern is that contaminated water will be mixed back into the groundwater.To date, the company has removed about 49 million gallons of water from the shaft, leaving it to evaporate in an aboveground pool or sharing it with local ranchers for their cattle once treated to EPA standards. Reimondo worries that water could eventually contaminate not only drinking water sources but the creeks and waterfalls throughout the Grand Canyon.Its really, really difficult for researchers to understand exactly what that risk is, because the region is so highly fractured and because we dont know exactly where water flows to and from, Reimondo said.Energy Fuels Curtis Moore thinks that concern is overblown. He said that the water that the company pumps out of the shaft is already highly concentrated in uranium because it has been in contact with the rocks long before their mining operations started.Their implication is that we are contaminating groundwater, which is simply false  its naturally not appropriate for human consumption, he said. He pointed to a 2022 permit from the state of Arizona that concluded the geology of the mine site like the slope of the land and type of rock are expected to prevent any potential impacts to groundwater resulting from mining operations.A separate 2021 study by scientists from the U.S. Geological Society found that the type of uranium mining conducted at Pinyon Plain Mine has historically had no confirmed effects on uranium levels in the groundwater sampled in and around the Grand Canyon. But the study also noted that it could take many years for any related pollution to reach the groundwater.That potential for negative long-term effects are what Havasupai Tribe members are concerned about. Dianna Uqualla, a Havasupai Tribal Council member, says if theres pollution in the aquifer years from now, she doubts anyone will take responsibility.Whos going to pay the price? she asked. Whos going to be the one to say, Yeah, I did it? I dont think anybodys going to do that. Theyre just going to say, Well, one less tribe, and were happy for that, is what the non-Natives will probably think.Uqualla is familiar with the long history of damage wrought by uranium mining on Native lands. In the nearby Navajo Nation, years of uranium mining caused lung cancer and a decadeslong struggle to get compensation. The mining was so widely harmful that the Navajo Nation has banned the transport of radioactive and related materials through their lands.Despite that ban, once mined, the uranium ore from Pinyon Plain Mine will be trucked to the White Mesa Mill in southern Utah along state and federal highways, including through Navajo Nation. Navajo President Buu Nygren has implored the federal government to step in on the matter.Once the ore makes it to White Mesa Mill, the company will extract natural uranium concentrate from the uranium ore, before selling the powder to U.S. nuclear power facilities, which arrange for the concentrate to be sent to other facilities for conversion and enrichment.Tilousi wishes that Congress would update the 1872 mining law that allowed Energy Fuels to continue operating a mine on a national monument. Thats something the Biden administration has recommended too, in part because the law allows companies to hold mining rights for long periods of time, which sows distrust among local communities including Indigenous peoples.Grist is the only award-winning newsroom focused on exploring equitable solutions to climate change.

safe,There is great potential for several new uranium production markets as the U.S. and Europe look to diversify away from Russia for new nuclear energy pursuits. The U.S. and several European countries have announced ambitious nuclear power plans for the coming decades, in support of a green transition. However, the lack of uranium production outside of Russia is posing a threat to achieving these plans. Sanctions introduced on Russian energy and other products, following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, have led to global shortages of natural gas, uranium, and other critical materials. This has driven several state powers to diversify their supply chains and increase the regional production of a variety of energy sources and related materials. This means we could soon see new uranium-producing markets emerge in Europe and the U.S.While the U.S. and Europe imposed strict sanctions on the import of energy products, such as oil and gas, it was more difficult to do the same with uranium due to the lack of alternative supplies. The decrease in Russian uranium imports has led to delays in several nuclear power projects in the U.S., despite the governments ambitious nuclear project pipeline.Russia only mines5 percent of the global uranium supply domestically, while Russias Rosatom State Nuclear Energy Corporation has several subsidiaries that mine uranium ore abroad, in countries such as Kazakhstan. Russia controls around 40 percent of the global processing facilities and 46 percent of the worlds total enrichment capacity. It is also way ahead of its competitors when it comes to producing innovative types of uranium, such as the high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) with a 15-19.75% share of enrichment, needed to power the latest generation of nuclear reactors.As Europe diversified away from Russian supplies of uranium,Kazakhstan became a major supplier, providing 26.82 percent of the EUs uranium in 2022. Kazakhstan has been steadily increasing its production capacity in recent years. Meanwhile, Niger provided 25.38 precent of the EUs supply, while Canada delivered 21.99 percent. However, Europe and the U.S. must develop their own uranium production capabilities if they want to avoid Russian-linked uranium production altogether, as well as ensure they remain competitive in the nuclear energy field.In December, the U.S. voted on abillprohibiting the import of Russian low-enriched uranium to the U.S. until 2040. This follows several stricter sanctions on Russian energy and recent innovations in the U.S. energy industry, such as increased LNG output and improved uranium production capabilities. In November, Centrus Energy Corpannouncedit had achieved the production of the first 20 kilograms ofhigh-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU)in the U.S. Part of the U.S. Department of Energys (DOE)HALEU Demonstration project, the project provided the first production of its kind in the country in over 70 years. The DOE hopes to achieve production at 16 advanced centrifuges at an enrichment facility in Piketon, Ohio.Piketon is currently the only facility licensed to produce this type of uranium, but, if successful, the U.S. could establish other production sites. Centrus was two months ahead of schedule in delivering the first 20kg of HALEU. The companys President and CEO, Daniel B. Poneman,stated, This critical milestone is essential to meeting the Departments near-term HALEU needs while laying the groundwork for the full restoration of Americas lost domestic uranium enrichment capacity We are committed to working with the Department and industry to build a public-private partnership so that we can scale up production in the coming years to meet the full range of commercial and national security requirements for enriched uranium. Centrus hopes to boost its annual production of HALEU to 900km in 2024, and even higher in the future. The fuel will be used to power the initial cores of two demonstration reactors awarded under DOEsAdvanced Reactor Demonstration Programme.The U.K. is also developing a HALEU production programme. The U.K. Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) recently announced plans to produce up to 24 GW of nuclear power by 2050. To achieve this feat, it will invest almost $12.7 million to develop the skills and site required to produce other advanced nuclear fuels in the country. The U.K. plans to use HALEU to power itsnext-generation reactors, which are expected to be up and running by the early 2030s. The DESNZ expects the funding to support the development of HALEU production capabilities in the northwest of England. Itstated, "This builds on the UK's work to displace Russia from the global nuclear fuels market, particularly in uranium conversion services, where government and industry are together investing up to 26 million to bring this capability back to the UK by the end of the decade.As the U.S. and Europe look to shift their nuclear dependency away from Russia by developing alternative supply chains and developing their uranium production capabilities, we can expect to see a rise in the number of uranium-producing markets around the world. This will support ambitious nuclear power plans across Europe and North America, as well as develop a more competitive global nuclear energy landscape.
safe,While the surge in closures is significant, the Bank of France emphasized that the level remains below the average annual bankruptcy filings recorded between 2010 and 2019, which stood at 59,342. The pandemic years saw a considerably lower number of business closures, almost half of the figures reported in 2023. The report highlighted that the majority of closures in 2023 affected small and medium-sized enterprises. Businesses withless than 250 employees accounted for the vast majority, totaling 55,435 closures. Additionally, medium and large firms with over 250 employees experienced an increase in closures, with their numbers doubling from 2022 to reach 57. The negative trend was particularly prominent in the restaurant and hotel industry, where closures surged by 44.6 percent year-on-year. The information and communication technologies sector also saw a significant increase of 44.4 percent. In contrast, the country's agricultural sector recorded a 1.3 percent drop in the number of bankruptcy filings. A global perspective reported by the Financial Times in December indicated that corporate bankruptcies worldwide surpassed levels seen during the 2008 global financial crisis. Analysts attribute this surge to higher key interest rates and the self-liquidation of so-called "zombie firms," which survived theWuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) era primarily due to government support.French economic activity for 2023 very disappointing The Bank of France recently also reported that French economic activity in 2023 was disappointing. In its latest report published in late December, the French central bank lowered its growth forecast for the country's economy to just 0.8 percent for 2023. (Related: Desperate French government trying to convince tourists that it is safe to visit the country despite ongoing rioting.) The central bank also reports that France's gross domestic product for the fourth quarter of 2023 only grew by a measly 0.1 percent, very narrowly avoiding a recessionand reversing the 0.1 percent contraction in GDP in the previous quarter. "[Economic] activity is resisting in the fourth quarter thanks to services," noted Bank of France Chief Economist Olivier Garnier. "The normalization trend in terms of price-setting behavior by companies is being confirmed month after month." Following the report on bankruptcies, recruitment remains a problem, with 45 percent of companies having problems filling vacancies. Despite the dismal economic reportscoming out of France, the country's central bank believes the economy will gradually recover in 2024, as it predicts inflation to drop from the annual average of 5.7 percent in 2023 to just 2.5 percent in 2024. Inflation will then continue to fall and by 2025 France is expected to drop to 1.8 percent, slightly below the European Central Bank's inflation target of two percent annually. The easing of price increases is expected to be combined with a rise in real wages, which the bank claims will provide French households with some breathing space as their purchasing power for 2024 increases by a projected 1.5 percent compared to last year's 0.7 percent increase. This could then fuel even more growth from 2025 onwards, which is when the negative effects of high interest rates are expected to fade and allow investment into France to pick up again after an expected 0.4 percent decrease in 2024. "In 2026, these trends should strengthen to generate a dynamic recovery," noted Garnier. Find more stories like this at Collapse.news.

"The normalization trend in terms of price-setting behavior by companies is being confirmed month after month." Following the report on bankruptcies, recruitment remains a problem, with 45 percent of companies having problems filling vacancies. Despite the dismal economic reportscoming out of France, the country's central bank believes the economy will gradually recover in 2024, as it predicts inflation to drop from the annual average of 5.7 percent in 2023 to just 2.5 percent in 2024. Inflation will then continue to fall and by 2025 France is expected to drop to 1.8 percent, slightly below the European Central Bank's inflation target of two percent annually. The easing of price increases is expected to be combined with a rise in real wages, which the bank claims will provide French households with some breathing space as their purchasing power for 2024 increases by a projected 1.5 percent compared to last year's 0.7 percent increase. This could then fuel even more growth from 2025 onwards, which is when the negative effects of high interest rates are expected to fade and allow investment into France to pick up again after an expected 0.4 percent decrease in 2024. "In 2026, these trends should strengthen to generate a dynamic recovery," noted Garnier. Find more stories like this at Collapse.news.

safe,RICHLAND, Wash., Jan.  10, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Energy Northwest today announced an agreement with Bellevue-based Puget Sound Energy to accelerate the agencys program examining the feasibility of developing and deploying a next-generation nuclear energy facility. State policies requiring a substantial increase in clean electricity are leading utilities to evaluate potential sources of new clean energy generation; and nuclear energy possesses many of the key attributes vital to establishing a reliable, emissions-free electric grid. New nuclear energy technologies, such as advanced small modular reactors, are approaching commercial readiness and feature enhanced safety systems; simplified, standardized, and scalable designs; and the ability to both swiftly integrate with renewables and provide around-the-clock electricity  without producing any greenhouse gas emissions.The agreement, a $10 million investment by Puget Sound Energy in Energy Northwests new nuclear project feasibility phase, will guide future participation and investment decisions. This collaboration does not obligate Puget Sound Energy to any future financial commitment nor signify an ownership interest in a developed project.Energy Northwest is committed to developing clean energy resources capable of helping Washington state meet its climate and carbon reduction goals. As we de-carbonize the electric grid, it is increasingly evident new sources of carbon-free, reliable, and affordable electricity must be deployed  and advanced nuclear energy technology can play a vital role in this transition, said Bob Schuetz, Energy Northwest chief executive officer. Energy Northwests partnership with Puget Sound Energy underscores our shared commitment to address the climate challenge and meet the regions future clean energy needs with the help of new and innovative carbon-free nuclear energy technologies.Energy Northwest has been at the forefront of explorations into the viability of building a next generation nuclear energy plant in central Washington for several years. Such a facility could prove invaluable in meeting the states climate goals without jeopardizing the reliability and affordability of the electric grid. As the owner of Columbia Generating Station, the northwests only commercial nuclear power plant, as well as the developer and operator of a full suite of renewable and energy storage resources, Energy Northwest is well-positioned to investigate and facilitate a potential project.Our clean energy future depends on finding reliable resources that produce energy when customers need it without emitting greenhouse gases, said Mary Kipp, president and CEO of Puget Sound Energy. Advanced nuclear technology has the potential to be that resource. Im excited to partner with Energy Northwest as part of our efforts to identify and secure reliable, cost-effective clean energy for our 1.2 million electric customers in the state of Washington."The financial commitment by Puget Sound Energy will supplement the approximately $10 million contributed to date by Energy Northwest and supporting entities, including nearly $1 million in combined investment from 17 northwest public utilities. For over two years Energy Northwest thoroughly investigated numerous emerging nuclear energy technologies, arriving at the determination X-energys advanced small modular reactor  known as the Xe-100  is the design best tailored to the regions specific needs. The ongoing analysis of project structures, schedules, and overall viability will inform future project investments and ultimately the prudency of a final investment decision.Energy Northwest is a Washington state public power joint operating agency and a premier provider of carbon-free electricity.

safe,BERKELEY, Calif., Jan.  22, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Todays news that President Biden will not resubmit former Commissioner Jeff Barans nomination to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission marks a watershed for efforts to modernize the NRC and for Congressional Democrats.America, the world, and the climate needs a nuclear regulator that takes the benefits of nuclear energy seriously. Nuclear energy protects public health, is a key technology for decarbonization and environmental conservation, and is a reliable and secure source of abundant electricity.Radiological safety is important. But current regulatory practice at the NRC sacrifices public health and safety in an endless effort to minimize exposure to low levels of radiological exposure that are so infinitesimal as to be unobservable epidemiologically.For over 70 years, nuclear energy has been an extraordinarily safe technology. Existing nuclear plants in the United States have saved over 600,000 Americans from premature death due to exposure to air pollution from conventional fossil fueled power plants. New nuclear technologies will be safer still and have the potential to save millions more lives all over the world. America and the world needs advanced nuclear technology to be commercialized as soon as possible.

safe,The National Rally Against Reckless Renewables is on the first sitting day of Parliament, Tuesday, 6th February 2024, at 10am in front of Parliament House. This peaceful rally is grassroots, representing many diverse regional communities who are directly and adversely affected by the Australian Governments reckless rollout of renewables. We urge the Federal and State Governments to cease their reckless rollout of unreliable, unaffordable, and environmentally destructive wind, solar, limited firming batteries, and high-voltage transmission lines, amidst an ever-increasing demand for reliable electricity.Currently, there are over 1000 new renewable projects in the governments Powering Our Nation pipeline (Source AEMO, 2023). Almost all of these are located in Regional Australia. In the lead-up to most of these projects, this government has conducted short, insincere, and unacknowledged community consultation. Exploiting the fact that most of these projects are located in or near coastal, farming, and traditional communities with small populations, the government continues to disregard our concerns. In many cases, our right to judicial review or appeal has or will be removed.Australian consumers, taxpayers, and industries require an electricity network that is efficient, safe, reliable, secure, and affordable. It is critical for Australia, now and in the future, to establish a network that does not damage our unique environment, particularly productive agricultural land, fisheries, and native habitats.This governments reckless rollout of renewables poses a significant threat to our nation, threatening food production for Australians and 80 million consumers globally. Our fauna and flora are facing unprecedented destruction, as hundreds of thousands of hectares of land and ocean floors are being deforested and/or damaged. It is posing a threat to our economy, costing over $121 billion (AEMO, 2023). There are documented serious supply chain and sustainment issues, and therefore reliability risks, potentially leading to mass blackouts. Massive taxpayer subsidies and electricity bills will flow offshore for decades to the many greenwashed multinationals lined up for these subsidised investments.This rally is a coalition of grassroots community groups united under the National Rational Energy Network. We call upon the Australian Government to:1. Conduct an urgent Senate Inquiry: Establish a Senate Inquiry to scrutinise the technical veracity as well as the excessive economic, social and environmental costs of renewables, and the escalating risks to our national interest and security. This includes reviewing the committed, anticipated, actionable and future projects being fast-tracked by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment, and Water, in particular the Capacity Investment Scheme, Rewiring the Nation, Offshore Wind Projects, and expanding unelected overreaching organisations including the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, Climate Change Authority, Clean Energy Finance Corporation, Australian Energy Market Operator, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, and Clean Energy Council.2. Suspend all renewable energy projects: We call on the Australian Government to convene the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) Energy Council and request all states and territories suspend wind, solar, hydro and associated transmission construction until the above Senate Inquiry reports.3. Lift the ban on nuclear power: Nuclear energy has the lowest overall greenhouse gas emissions of any energy source as a result of its low land footprint, low material usage, and low waste output. The current ban is archaic, restraining Australia from achieving a strong reliable energy future.This is a national grassroots call for a responsible and sustainable approach to our energy future. We urge the Australian government to prioritise the well- being of our environment, communities, and the future of our nation.[10.00am Mr Grant Piper] [10.10am Ms Gemma Pride] [10.20am Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price] [10.30am Mr Craig Kelly] [10.40am Senator Ralph Babet] [10.50am Senator Ross Cadell] [11.00am Hon Barnaby Joyce MP] [11.10am The Hon Dr David Gillespie MP] [11.20 Senator the Hon.

Aboriginals speaking about desecration of sacred land during the building wind turbines are about as welcome in Aussie mainstream media as black power people supporting Trump are in the US mainstream media.Jacinta Price is one of Australias star politicians. She and her mother Bess Price (and families) are from Alice Springs and deserve high-praise for standing resolutely on principles that have nothing to do with race.No Bill, Jacinta is an evil Alt White and does not correctly represent the traditional owners who have had 100,000 years of perfect harmony on this continent which clearly involved sustainable farming in large permanent towns and had nothing to do with killing off all the megafauna and/or burning down so much of the forests that the rainfall patterns changed. Clearly.Did we get the Completely Unrelated Third Party Who No One Has Heard Of Before Or Invited that can march up in neo 1930s Euro cosplay and decisively prove to the MSM that the entire rally was funded by. (gasp) the Alt Right!! ?5- 30 meters deep) sea sponge. (A meaning from a limited sampled area a small part part of, NOT the whole Caribbean. My beach collected sponge spicules are all shallow origin.) Down where we already know thermocline temperatures are affected by ocean currents. And where we also know sea sponge spicule chemistry is at best a sketchy proxy for temperature alonewhich is why previously sea sponges almost never were used before as a temp proxy. Not even by Mann, Marcott, or Pages2.Novel but sketchy narrow geographic proxy extrapolated to usual alarmist global result. Very climate sciency. Alarmists are now probably scraping the bottom of their rotten climate science Apple barrel.The net zero agenda is so farcical it might be prudent to bring along a troop of clowns, comedians and cartoonists who are best able to explain and depict the logic of the government programs for net zero.I contributed to one of their meetings, they were talking about amalgamating into a single organisation, and I suggested not to. I said whoever is head of that organisation will make themselves a target, that a brush fire is the hardest kind of fire to fight, because there is no single place our opponents can focus to put it out.Naturally theyre getting the silent treatment from mainstream media, or when mentioned are dismissed as cranks and extremists, but their demands are actually quite moderate. For example, though some are totally against renewables, many of the participants are OK with powerlines being built, but they want them built underground, where they wont bother anyone.I contributed to one of their meetings, they were talking about amalgamating into a single organisation, and I suggested not to. I said whoever is head of that organisation will make themselves a target, that a brush fire is the hardest kind of fire to fight, because there is no single place our opponents can focus to put it out.BTW Nick, why do you h@te poor people so much as to want to feather your crony friends nests with grant money for settled science and money to the Chinese and European solar and wind bird chopper manufacturers.Nick Stokes shared a photo of the rally when it had barely begun. Well Im a part of that grass roots movement and trust me it has grown substantially over the past five years to well over a hundred different groups. What people forget is that Australia is a huge continent with a relatively small population so we are never going to be able to hold rallies like those in Europe. They are geographically small countries with large populations.There were attendees from parts of Queensland, Victoria and South Australia which means they travelled there by plane most likely. Those from within NSW would still have had many hours of driving to get to Canberra as well as one or two nights accommodation. My point is that to attend the rally was costly and took valuable time out of a farmers work schedule. We were impressed with the attendance of the people who put in so much valuable time, effort and personal expense to get the attention of the politicians on their first day back in parliament.Getup, which is along the same lines as the Antifa dress up crowd, tried to intimidate us with a flood of messages stating that they would effectively take over the rally with their presence and were asking their supporters for $12 donations towards signs that would outnumber ours at the rally. No one turned up! Then they had the gall to put out a message that theyd basically shut us down. All lies! We experienced none of the opposition we had expected.We had amazing support from politicians speaking up for us as well as farmers and others from the regions who spoke really well. Peter Ridd spoke too, a name that you would all be familiar with. The government now know that there is considerable opposition to their renewables plan. And as we are many groups united it will not be easy for them to shut us down.
safe,Lithium polymer batteries have had quite the impact on many portable devices like phones and laptops in the past three decades. Depending on battery capacity and size, laptops can now operate more than 15 h and phones may last up to several days per single charge, plus there is support for rapid chargers that can fully recharge batteries in less than an hour. However, save for the new GaN chargers, the progress has been slowing down considerably in the Li-ion sector, as chip makers try to offer increased power efficiency through transistor miniaturization. China now intends to revolutionize this industry with a new type of battery that acts as a micro nuclear reactor promising to offer continuous power for 50 years.Betavolt New Energy Technology Co., Ltd from China successfully developed a micro nuclear energy battery based on the nickel-63 nuclear isotope decay along with the first diamond semiconductor. The battery model is known as BV100 and it is said to generate electricity for 50 years without charging or maintenance. Considering that we now buy new devices every few years, even 2-3 years of continuous power should be sufficient. Betavolt plans to initiate mass production later this year.With such an endeavor, China claims that it is way ahead of Europe and America, which only developed large-size thermonuclear batteries used in the aerospace industry. Betavolt managed to miniaturize the concept and make it viable for portable devices. Just like the large-size batteries, the new BV100 coin-size models convert the energy released by the decay of nuclear isotopes into electrical current through a semiconductor converter. Betavolt tests revealed that the nickel-63 isotope works best for small size batteries, so the BV100 design places a 2 mm thick nickel-63 sheet between 2x 10 mm thick diamond semiconductor layers to facilitate the electrical current conversion.In the promotional material released by Betavolt, the battery appears to include three stacked modules, each with an isotope sheet placed between 2 converter layers. Betavolt explains that it can produce designs with dozens or hundreds of independent unit modules used in parallel, allowing for different sizes and capacities.The BV100 has a volume of only 15 X 15 X 5 mm so power rating is limited to 100 microW at 3V. It produces 8.64 J per day and 3153 J per year. A larger 1 W model is planned to be released by 2025 and that one may be more suitable for phones and drones.Even though it is dealing with radioactive isotopes, Betavolt ensures that this type of battery is safe for the environment and will not catch on fire or explode due to mishandling or harsh conditions. It can safely power medical devices such as pacemakers, artificial hearts and cochleas in the human body. Once it completely decays, the nickel-63 isotope becomes a stable isotope of copper, which is non-radioactive, poses no threat or pollution to the environment and does not require expensive recycling processes.
safe,The Biden administration showed up to last months global climate summit in Dubai with a radical new plan to replace coal and compete again with Russia and China over a technology American scientists pioneered.The United States led nearly two dozen other nations in a pledge to triple the worlds supply of nuclear power by 2050. While most of the reactors under construction in other countries today are Russian models, the U.S. promoted its growing slate of high-tech startups with cutting-edge reactor designs as an American alternative to working with the Kremlin.The big problem with that pitch? The small, next-generation nuclear reactors companies like the one billionaire Bill Gates backs are designed to run on a potent but rare type of uranium fuel with only one commercial supplier on the market: the Russian government.On Tuesday, the Department of Energy offered private companies a minimum of $2 million each to start producing HALEU domestically, the second part of a $500 million tranche of federal dollars for nuclear fuel production from President Joe Bidens climate-spending law, the Inflation Reduction Act. The agency announced the first for a separate part of the HALEU-making process in November.Boosting our domestic uranium supply wont just advance President Bidens historic climate agenda, Ali Zaidi, Bidens national climate adviser, said in a statement, but also increase Americas energy security, create good-paying union jobs, and strengthen our economic competitiveness.All 93 atom-splitting machines operating at U.S. power plants today are conventional light-water reactors based on the technology first commercialized in the 1950s to harness the tremendous heat released from fission reactions to boil water that makes steam that spins turbines to generate huge volumes of nonstop zero-carbon electricity.Light-water reactors are only built to handle fuel made from uranium enriched up to 5% using high-speed gas centrifuges into the unstable uranium-235 isotope needed for a sustained fission reaction. Many of the advanced reactors now vying for regulatory approval in the U.S. are instead designed to handle fuel enriched up to 20%, meaning the technology uses four times as much of the energy per unit of uranium as the traditional variety.While the U.S. and its allies levied unprecedented sanctions on Russias oil, gas and mining companies after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Moscows state-owned Rosatom remains immune as the fourth-largest source of traditional fuel imports for American utilities.The U.S. used to produce most of its own reactor fuel. As part of the 1990s, a Clinton-era deal encouraged the struggling post-Soviet Russia to dismantle its nuclear weapons, however, the U.S. agreed to buy any reactor fuel made from weapons. The cheap supply of Russian fuel put U.S. enrichers out of business, with the last facility closing down a decade ago.Canada, Kazakhstan and Australia  the top three suppliers of uranium to the U.S., respectively  are all looking to increase mining. Frances state-owned uranium company, Orano, announced plans in October to increase enriched fuel production by 30%. Three new uranium mines entered into production in Arizona and Utah in just the past few months.But next-generation reactors that need HALEU suffer from a classic chicken-versus-egg problem. Who can confidently invest in building a first-of-a-kind reactor that needs Russian fuel while the U.S. is trading barbs with Moscow? Who can confidently invest in enriching fuel for reactors that dont currently exist and are not yet even licensed in the U.S.?The federal government is providing an answer to both by pumping billions into propping up advanced reactors and fuel production in hopes they can advance simultaneously in time for the projected start of the new nuclear rollout at the start of the 2030s.But Edward McGinnis, who spent 30 years working on nuclear power at the Energy Department before becoming the chief executive of the fuel-recycling startup Curio, said the Biden administration is overlooking a vital potential source of HALEU: nuclear waste.The spent rods of uranium pellets that come out of traditional reactors after a two-year fuel cycle still contain as much as 97% of their energy  which is why the material remains dangerously radioactive for so long. Companies like Curio want to use special tools to separate all the different radioactive isotopes out of nuclear waste, dramatically reducing how much toxic material needs to be stored long term and increasing the domestic supply of reactor fuel.Recycling nuclear waste is a complicated process that the U.S. government feared in the 1970s would increase the supply of radioactive materials for weapons, banning the nations first facility from opening. France, Russia and Japan all built plants to reprocess uranium fuel. While the U.S. lifted its ban on nuclear recycling in 2005, no company has yet made a serious attempt to build a new facility.The draft letter of the Energy Departments latest request for proposals for enriching HALEU states on page 8 that the uranium used to make the fuel must have been mined and converted, and not come from a source that was recycled or reprocessed. The agency told HuffPost it couldnt determine whether fuel made from recycled uranium would meet the purity standards needed for use in experimental new reactors, so DOE has chosen to focus this procurement on HALEU generated from fresh feedstock supplies.Some people dont realize when were saying we need to support HALEU that recycling can be one of the two solid legs of our future nuclear fuel domestic production capability, McGinnis said by phone Tuesday.The main federal effort for funding nuclear waste recycling is the Energy Departments experimental ARPA-E program, which in 2022 gave out $38 million to companies and laboratories for research, including $5 million to Curio.Rep. Chuck Fleischmann (R-Tenn.), who chairs the Houses appropriations subcommittee on water and energy, tacked $15 million for reprocessing uranium fuel onto the latest federal budget proposal to help companies advance beyond the research phase into licensing and locating an actual plant.McGinnis said the U.S. hasnt even considered spending that kind of money deploying nuclear waste recycling in at least 15 years. He called on the Senate and White House to champion the measure in budget talks.Youre not only complementing the traditional uranium mining, youre also, by extracting from our so-called nuclear waste, solving to a large degree the nuclear waste problem at the same time, he said.

Some high points have come in 2007, 2015, 2017, and 2024. Each time it has been absolutely critical to attack Iran at once. There could be no delay. Dominoes would fall. Terrorism would prevail. Credibility would be sqandered. And yet, each time, the threatened war has not been launched, and the world has gone on just the same.Weve seen a wide variety of excuses deployed over these years of unsuccessful propaganda for a war on Iran, including false claims about nuclear weapons, the pretense that attacking Iran would improve civil liberties within Iran, and shockingly honest commitments to gaining control of more oil with which to slowly destroy the habitability of the Earth. The push to attack Iran has been on for so long that entire categories of arguments for it (such as that the Iranians are fueling the Iraqi resistance) and demonized leaders of Iran have come and gone. The latest excuse is the killing of three members of the U.S. military.Ordinarily, killing people could be prosecuted as a crime. But thats tricky, because the United States government opposes and refuses to take part in international law, the U.S. troops had no legal justification for being where they were, and the violence across the region is being driven by U.S. support for enormous crimes by the Israeli government.More importantly, the advocates for war do not want to prosecute a crime, but to use a crime as an excuse to commit much larger crimes, on the familiar model of September 11, October 7, etc. The choice to escalate is not imposed on anyone; similar situations in the past have been used as excuses for war and also allowed to pass without the launching of any war.The U.S. government purports to believe that escalating wars will reduce wars, flying in the face of the overwhelming evidence of centuries, and to believe that there is no alternative, even though the demands of all sorts of warmakers across Western Asia are all the same and extremely easy to satisfy (and satisfying them has been ordered by the International Court of Justice): stop destroying Gaza and killing Gazans.The U.S. government distorts the notion of defense beyond all recognition by claiming that harm done to its imperial troops anywhere on Earth can justify a defensive war. This is highly convenient for war hawks in Washington, D.C., who have known for many years that getting U.S. troops killed can be a big propaganda boost for war madness  an idea eagerly encouraged today by U.S. media outlets that are always perfectly capable of demanding revenge while simulaneously calling it defense.This is what the empire of U.S. military bases looks like to Iran. Try to imagine if you lived there, what you would think of this. Who is threatening whom? Who is the greater danger to whom? The point is not that Iran should be free to attack the United States or anyone else because its military is smaller. The point is that doing so would be national suicide. It would also be something Iran has not done for centuries. But it would be typical U.S. behavior.The U.S. overthrew Irans democracy in 1953 and installed a brutal dictator / weapons customer. The U.S. gave Iran nuclear energy technology in the 1970s. Following the Iranian revolution, the United States aided Iraq in the 1980s in attacking Iran, providing Iraq with some of the weapons (including chemical weapons) that were used on Iranians and that would be used in 2002-2003 (when they no longer existed) as an excuse for attacking Iraq.The roots of a Washington push for a new war on Iran can be found in the 1992 Defense Planning Guidance, the 1996 paper called A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm, the 2000 Rebuilding Americas Defenses, and in a 2001 Pentagon memo described by Wesley Clark as listing these nations for attack: Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Lebanon, Syria, and Iran. Its worth noting that Bush Jr. overthrew Iraq, and Obama Libya, while the others remain works in progress. The arguments in these old forgotten memos were not what the war makers tell the public, but much closer to what they tell each other. The concerns were those of dominating regions rich in resources, intimidating others, and establishing bases from which to maintain control of puppet governments.In 2000, the CIA gave Iran nuclear bomb plans in an effort to frame it. This was reported by James Risen, and Jeffrey Sterling went to prison for allegedly being Risens source. But nobody involved in the scheme was ever punished in any way.In 2010, Tony Blair included Iran on a list of countries that he said Dick Cheney had aimed to overthrow. The line among the powerful in Washington in 2003 was that Iraq would be a cakewalk but that real men go to Tehran.For many years, the United States has labeled Iran an evil nation, attacked and destroyed the other non-nuclear nation on the list of evil nations, designated part of Irans military a terrorist organization, falsely accused Iran of crimes including the attacks of 9-11, murdered Iranian scientists, funded opposition groups in Iran (including some the U.S. also designates as terrorist), flew dronesover Iran, openly and illegally threatened to attack Iran, and built up military forces all around Irans borders, while imposing cruel sanctions on the country. The long history of the United States lying about Iranian nuclear weapons is chronicled by Gareth Porters book Manufactured Crisis.In 2007, we were told that Iran needed to be attacked urgently due to false claims about nuclear weapons. Even a National Intelligence Estimate in 2007 pushed back and admitted that Iran had no nuclear weapons program.In 2015, Republicans urged war justified by Irans nuclear weapons program, while Democrats successfully moved for passage of an agreement with Iran, also justified by Irans nuclear weapons program. The agreement was not a treaty, and President Trump would later throw it out. But the damage of both sides falsely claiming that Iran had a nuclear weapons program was done.Dick and Liz Cheneys book, Exceptional, tell us we must see a moral difference between an Iranian nuclear weapon and an American one. Must we, really? Either risks further proliferation, accidental use, use by a crazed leader, mass death and destruction, environmental disaster, retaliatory escalation, and apocalypse. One of those two nations has nuclear weapons, has used nuclear weapons, has provided the other with plans for nuclear weapons, has a policy of first-use of nuclear weapons, has leadership that sanctions the possession of nuclear weapons, and has frequently threated to use nuclear weapons. I dont think those facts would make a nuclear weapon in the hands of the other country the least bit moral, but also not the least bit more immoral. Lets focus on seeing an empiricaldifference between an Iranian nuclear weapon and an American one. One exists. The other doesnt.If youre wondering, U.S. presidents who have made specific public or secret nuclear threats to other nations, that we know of, as documented in Daniel Ellsbergs The Doomsday Machine, have included Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump, while others, including Barack Obama and Donald Trump have frequently said things like All options are on the table in relation to Iran or another country.Proponents of war or steps toward war (sanctions was a step toward the war on Iraq) say we urgently need a war on Iran now, but they have no argument for urgency, and theyve been making the same argument with ever less credibility for years.The Trump White House early on openly expressed a desire to claim that Iran had violated the 2015 nuclear agreement, but produced no evidence. It didnt matter. Trump tore up the agreement anyway and used his own shredding of the agreement as grounds for nuclear fearmongering about Iran.In 2017, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations claimed that Iranian weapons had been used in a war that the U.S.., Saudi Arabia, and allies were illegally and disastrously waging in Yemen. While thats a problem that should be corrected, it is hard to find a war anywhere on the planet without U.S. weapons in it. In fact, a report that made news the same day as the ambassadors claims, pointed to the long-known fact that many of the weapons used by ISIS had once belonged to the United States, many of them having been given by the U.S. to non-state fighters (aka terrorists) in Syria.Fighting wars and arming others to fight wars/terrorism is a justification for indictment and prosecution, but not for war, legally, morally, or practically. The United States fights and arms wars, and no one would be justified in attacking the United States.If Iran is guilty of a crime, and there is evidence to support that claim, the United States and the world should seek its prosecution. Instead, the United States is isolating itself by tearing down the rule of law.President Biden came into office with the possibility wide open to restore the Iran agreement and pursue a better course. He chose not to do so, and not to even try to do so. He waited for a less amendable government to take power in Iran, and then did seemingly everything he could to stir up hostitlities in the region. Now an agreement looks much more difficult to obtain.Of course the reason why real men go to Tehran is that Iran is not the impoverished disarmed nation that one might find in, say, Afghanistan or Iraq, or even the disarmed nation found in Libya in 2011. Iran is much bigger and much better armed. Whether the United States launches a major assault on Iran or Israel does, Iran will retaliate against U.S. troops and probably Israel and possibly the United States itself as well. And the United States will without any doubt re-retaliate for that. Iran cannot be unaware that the U.S. governments pressure on the Israeli government not to attack Iran consists of reassuring the Israelis that the United States will attack when needed, and does not include even threatening to stop funding Israels military or to stop vetoing measures of accountability for Israeli crimes at the United Nations.Of course, many in the U.S. government and military oppose attacking Iran, although key figures like Admiral William Fallon have been moved out of the way. Much of the Israeli military is opposed as well, not to mention the Israeli and U.S. people. But war is not clean or precise. If the people we allow to run our nations attack another, we are all put at risk.Most at risk, of course, are the people of Iran, people as peaceful as any other, or perhaps more so. As in any country, no matter what its government, the people of Iran are fundamentally good, decent, peaceful, just, and fundamentally like you and me. Ive met people from Iran. You may have met people from Iran. They look like this. Theyre not a different species. Theyre not evil. A surgical strike against a facility in their country would cause a great many of them to die very painful and horrible deaths. Even if you imagine that Iran would not retaliate for such attacks, this is what the attacks would in themselves consist of: mass murder.And what would that accomplish? It would unite the people of Iran and much of the world against the United States. It would justify in the eyes of much of the world an underground Iranian program to develop nuclear weapons, a program that probably does not exist at present, except to the extent that legal nuclear energy programs move a country closer to weapons development. The environmental damage would be tremendous, the precedent set incredibly dangerous, all talk of cutting the U.S. military budget would be buried in a wave of war frenzy, civil liberties and representative government would be flushed down the Potomac, a nuclear arms race would spread to additional countries, and any momentary sadistic glee would be outweighed by accelerating home foreclosures, mounting student debt, and accumulating layers of cultural stupidity.Strategically, legally, and morally weapons possession is not grounds for war, and neither is pursuit of weapons possession. And neither, I might add, with Iraq in mind, is theoretically possible pursuit of weapons never acted upon. Israel has nuclear weapons. The United States has more nuclear weapons than any other country but Russia (the two of them together have 90% of the worlds nukes). There can be no justification for attacking the United States, Israel, or any other country. The pretense that Iran has or will soon have nuclear weapons is, in any case, just a pretense, one that has been revived, debunked, and revived again like a zombie for years and years. But thats not the really absurd part of this false claim for something that amounts to no justification for war whatsoever.The really absurd part is that it was the United States in 1976 that pushed nuclear energy on Iran. In 2000 the CIA gave the Iranian government (slightly flawed) plans to build a nuclear bomb. In 2003, Iran proposed negotiations with the United States with everything on the table, including its nuclear technology, and the United States refused. Shortly thereafter, the United States started angling for a war. Meanwhile, U.S.-led sanctions prevent Iran from developing wind energy, while the Koch brothers are allowed to trade with Iran without penalty.Another area of ongoing lie debunking, one that almost exactly parallels the buildup to the 2003 attack on Iraq, is the relentless false claim, including by candidates in 2012 for U.S. President, that Iran has not allowed inspectors into its country or given them access to its sites. Iran had, in fact, prior to the agreement voluntarily accepted stricter standards than the IAEA requires. And of course a separate line of propaganda, albeit a contradictory one, holds that the IAEA has discovered a nuclear weapons program in Iran. Under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), Iran was not required to declare all of its installations, and early last decade it chose not to, as the United States violated that same treaty by blocking Germany, China, and others from providing nuclear energy equipment to Iran. While Iran remains in compliance with the NPT, India and Pakistan and Israel have not signed it and North Korea has withdrawn from it, while the United States and other nuclear powers continuously violate it by failing to reduce arms, by providing arms to other countries such as India, and by developing new nuclear weapons, not to mention keeping nuclear weapons in six European countries, providing Russia to put them into one European country as well.Are you ready for an even more absurd twist? This is on the same scale as Bushs comment about not really giving much thought to Osama bin Laden. Are you ready? The proponents of attacking Iran themselves admit that if Iran had nukes it would not use them. This is from the American Enterprise Institute:The biggest problem for the United States is not Iran getting a nuclear weapon and testing it, its Iran getting a nuclear weapon and not using it. Because the second that they have one and they dont do anything bad, all of the naysayers are going to come back and say, See, we told you Iran is a responsible power. We told you Iran wasnt getting nuclear weapons in order to use them immediately.  And they will eventually define Iran with nuclear weapons as not a problem.Is that clear? Iran using a nuclear weapon would be bad: environmental damage, loss of human life, hideous pain and suffering, yada, yada, yada. But what would be really bad would be Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon and doing what every other nation with them has done since Nagasaki: nothing. That would be really bad because it would damage an argument for war and make war more difficult, thus allowing Iran to run its country as it, rather than the United States, sees fit. Of course it might run it very badly (although the U.S. is hardly establishing a model for the world over here either), but it would run it without U.S. approval, and that would be worse than nuclear destruction.Inspections were allowed in Iraq and they worked. They found no weapons and there were no weapons. Inspections have been allowed in Iran and have worked. However, the IAEA has come under the corrupting influence of the U.S. government. And yet, the bluster from war proponents about IAEA claims over the years is not backed up by any actual claims from the IAEA. And what little material the IAEA has provided for the cause of war has been widely rejected when not being laughed at.Another year, another lie. No longer do we hear that North Korea is helping Iran build nukes. Lies about Iranian backing of Iraqi resisters have faded. (Didnt the United States back French resistance to Germans at one point?) Another recent concoction is the Iran did 911 lie. Revenge, like the rest of these attempted grounds for war, is actually not a legal or moral justification for war. But the 9/11 fiction has already been put to rest by the indespensable Gareth Porter, among others. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, which did play a role in 911 as well as in the Iraqi resistance, is being sold record quantities of that good old leading U.S. export of which were all so proud: weapons of mass destruction.Oh, I almost forgot another lie that hasnt quite entirely faded yet. Iran did not try to blow up a Saudi ambassador in Washington, D.C., an action which President Obama would have considered perfectly praiseworthy if the roles were reversed, but a lie that even Fox News had a hard time stomaching. And thats saying something.And then theres that old standby: Ahmadinejad said Israel should be wiped off the map. While this does not, perhaps, rise to the level of John McCain singing about bombing Iran or Bush and Obama swearing that all options including nuclear attack are on the table, it sounds extremely disturbing: wiped off the map! However, the translation is a bad one. A more accurate translation was the regime occupying Jerusalem must vanish from the page of time. The government of Israel, not the nation of Israel. Not even the government of Israel, but the current regime. Hell, Americans say that about their own regimes all the time, alternating every four to eight years depending on political party (some of us even say it all the time, without immunity for either party). Iran has made clear it would approve of a two-state solution if Palestinians approved of it. If the U.S. launched missile strikes every time somebody said something stupid, even if accurately translated, how safe would it be to live near Newt Gingrichs or Joe Bidens house?Luckily, war resisters have succeeded for so long (even while telling each other that they never succeed) that the war mongers dont remember who Ahmadinejad even was anymore, and all that demonization has gone to nought.The real danger may not actually be the lies. The Iraq experience has built up quite a mental resistance to these sorts of lies in many U.S. residents. The real danger may be the slow start of a war that gains momentum on its own without any formal announcement of its initiation. Israel and the United States have not just been talking tough or crazy. Theyve been murdering Iranians. And they seem to have no shame about it. The day after a Republican presidential primary debate at which candidates declared their desire to kill Iranians, the CIA apparently made certain the news was public that it was in fact already murdering Iranians, not to mention blowing up buildings. Some would say and have said that the war has already begun. Those who cannot see this because they do not want to see it will also miss the deadly humor in the United States asking Iran to return its brave drone.There was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war. The one that interested me the most was why dont we build  we in our shipyard  build four or five boats that look like Iranian PT boats. Put Navy seals on them with a lot of arms. And next time one of our boats goes to the Straits of Hormuz, start a shoot-up. Might cost some lives. And it was rejected because you cant have Americans killing Americans. Thats the kind of  thats the level of stuff were talking about. Provocation. But that was rejected.Now, Dick Cheney is not your typical American. Nobody in the U.S. government is your typical American. Your typical American is struggling, disapproves of the U.S. government, wishes billionaires were taxed, favors green energy and education and jobs over military boondoggles, thinks corporations should be barred from buying elections, and would not be inclined to apologize for getting shot in the face by the Vice President.Back in the 1930s, the Ludlow Amendment nearly made it a Constitutional requirement that the public vote in a referendum before the United States could go to war. President Franklin Roosevelt blocked that proposal. Yet the Constitution already required and still requires that Congress declare war before a war is fought. That has not been done in almost 80 years, while wars have raged on almost incessantly. In the past decade and right up through President Obamas signing of the outrageous National Defense Authorization Act on New Years Eve 2011-2012, the power to make war has been handed over to presidents. Here is one more reason to oppose a presidential war on Iran: once you allow presidents to make wars, you will never stop them. Another reason, in so far as anybody any longer gives a damn, is that war is a crime. Iran and the United States are parties to the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which bans war. One of those two nations is not complying.But we wont have a referendum. The U.S. House of Misrepresentatives wont step in. Only through widespread public pressure and nonviolent action will we intervene in this slow-motion catastrophe. This war, if it happens, will be fought by an institution called the United States Department of Defense, but it will endanger rather than defending us. As the war progresses, we will be told that the Iranian people want to be bombed for their own good, for freedom, for democracy. But nobody wants to be bombed for that. Iran does not want U.S.-style democracy. Even the United States does not want U.S.-style democracy. We will be told that those noble goals are guiding the actions of our brave troops and our brave drones on the battlefield. Yet there will be no battlefield. There will be no front lines. There will be no trenches. There will simply be cities and towns where people live, and where people die. There will be no victory. There will be no progress accomplished through a surge. On January 5, 2012, then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta was asked at a press conference about the failures in Iraq and Afghanistan, and he replied simply that those were successes. That is the kind of success that could be expected in Iran were Iran a destitute and disarmed state.Now we begin to understand the importance of all the media suppression, blackouts, and lies about the damage done to Iraq and Afghanistan. Now we understand why Obama and Panetta embraced the lies that launched the War on Iraq. The same lies must now be revived, as for every war ever fought, for a War on Iran. Heres a video explaining how this will work, even with some new twistsand lots of variations. The U.S. corporate media is part of the war machine.Planning war and funding war creates its own momentum. Sanctions become, as with Iraq, a stepping stone to war. Cutting off diplomacy leaves few options open. Electoral pissing contests take us allwhere most of us did not want to be.These are the bombs most likely to launch this ugly and quite possibly terminal chapter of human history. This animation shows clearly what they would do. For an even better presentation, pair that with this audio of a misinformed caller trying hopelessly to persuade George Galloway that we should attack Iran.On January 2, 2012, the New York Times reported concern that cuts to the U.S. military budget raised doubts as to whether the United States would be prepared for a grinding, lengthy ground war in Asia. At a Pentagon press conference on January 5, 2012, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff reassured the press corpse (sic) that major ground wars were very much an option and that wars of one sort or another were a certainty. President Obamas statement of military policy released at that press conference listed the missions of the U.S. military. First was fighting terrorism, next detering aggression, then projecting power despite anti-access/area denial challenges, then the good old WMDs, then conquering space and cyberspace, then nuclear weapons, and finally  after all that  there was mention of defending the Homeland Formerly Known As The United States.The cases of Iraq and Iran are not identical in every detail, of course. But in both cases we are dealing with concerted efforts to get us into wars, wars based, as all wars are based, on lies. We may need to revive this appeal to U.S. and Israeli forces!Disclaimer: The contents of this article are of sole responsibility of the author(s).
