I got this wonderful machine just in time for fall leaf cleanup. Assembly took 5-10 minutes. It holds enough gas for at least 45 minutes of heavy usage and it's comfortable to wear. This is the only back pack blower I've ever used so I don't have anything to compare it to but it seems very powerful, even moving large wet leaves with ease. It starts in 3 to 4 pulls every time. It comes with enough 2 stroke oil to mix one gallon of fuel. I highly recommend this tool!
