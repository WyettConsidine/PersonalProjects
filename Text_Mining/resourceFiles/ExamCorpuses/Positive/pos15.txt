Fits good on the back and it comfortable enough. You’ll wanna get some decent hearing protection this thing is pretty loud. Only thing I don’t like is the blower chute or discharge hose whatever you call it don’t have a way of taking it off for storage other than losing off the hose clamp and backing it off for storage sakes. CFM is good it slings leaves across the ground the way I expected.
