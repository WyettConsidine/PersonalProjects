We bought a house on a lot with mature pine, oak and other “shedding” trees. The property had not been maintained in years so we were in the market for a leaf blower.

The blower had to be powerful enough to manage deep, wet, compact leaves, sticks and small rocks. It also needed to to be light, well balanced, easy to start and simple to refuel.

Husqvarna Checked all of the boxes!

Anyone who can use a mower can use this blower. The pull string to start requires minimal effort if you prime the engine well. I am a medium sized woman in my mid-50s. Four weeks after having carpal tunnel surgery on both hands, I was able to start the engine with no assistance.

Simple to put on and adjust. The padded harness clasps are at appropriate chest and waist levels. The harness stays tight while blower is operating.

It is a little heavy but blower’s weight is well distributed so it is easy to manage without having to adjust during use.

One tank of fuel lasts far longer than anticipated. Longest continuous use to date was just over 2 hours. Fuel is easily added.

Note: we’ve decided to use premixed fuel exclusively. Initially it seemed obvious to mix fuel ourselves because it can be less expensive. However, after doing research, we learned that pump gas has additives that can cause problems in the blowers engine.
