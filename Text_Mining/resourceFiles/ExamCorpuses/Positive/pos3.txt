I have had only two short sessions with this leaf blower. Based on that: 1. Unit is heavier than it looks, or I'm just getting old. It's a beast to place on the back. (And I'm coming from a Ryobi backpack unit.) 2. Webbing with which to secure the unit in place is a bit unwieldly. Maybe I'll figure it out. 3. Easy to start, First pull out of the shipping box and it took off, never hesitating. 4. Power might be an issue. Haven't figured out if the "speed enhancer" placed at the end of the nozzle is workable. Any lawn-care professionals I see don't use it. I live on the edge of woods, and hope to "effortlessly" blow leaves out of my yard. This unit has 20% more engine size than my Ryobi; I'm hoping for success with the leaves.
