Wow, just Wow! I have a hand leaf blower I thought was good. I bought this Husqvarna 150PB and it arrived yesterday. I followed the quick guide to put the tubes on the unit, adjusted the shoulder and chest straps to fit. Poured the premixed gas and oil, primed 10 times and Wala, I pulled the rope 2 times and it started, strapped this bad boy on and walked to my drainage ditch covered already in leaves. I cleaned the 120 ft ditch in less than 10 minutes and I'm 70 yrs old. I suggest placing the blower on an elevated surface to make it easier to strap it to your back because it's a little heavy to lift from the ground and get it on your back. I have a pain stimulator implanted in my back and was concerned of the padded back. No problems for me to walk with it for about 20 - 30 min. I haven't tried the smallest tube outlet yet, but highly recommend this unit. I have an acre with 9 trees. I'll try it out when snow arrives to clear my 103 ft gravel driveway. Highly recommend this blower from my 1st trial useage. It rained before I used it and it still cleared the wet leaves and even the small sticks. It's a little loud ( no surprise) I suggest ear protection and nice the exhaust blows to the rear instead out the side. Someone ask me what the Newtons was: Newtons 22 765 CFM and 270 MPH.
