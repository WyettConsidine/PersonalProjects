This blower had me really disappointed at first. I thought, what in the world is up with the power on this thing?? All the specs on it led me to believe that it should be annihilating my leaves. The power seemed like it was there, but the air coming out was less than half of what it advertised. To make a long story short, the end tip attachment was stuck inside the rubber flex hose… I pulled this piece out, attached it to the end of the hose and this blower cranked like a beast! It made quick work of a driveway covered in wet maple leaves. I am using the Husqvarna premixed fuel. So what started out as an angry review of how horrible this blower was, ended up with me feeling like an idiot… It’s an incredible blower for the price.
