Get it! Trust me! It is so usefull if you have a decent sized yard. I had a handheld one that last a long time. But I just had too many leaves!

This thing sat in my cart for months waiting to pull the trigger, but then winter came and I was charging my handheld 2-3 times a day! I had to buy a backpack!

Make sure you also have a gas can at home! You will need to go to the gas station and get ethanol free gas and mix it with the oil provided! It would not hurt to buy something to mix the gas and oil together! I also bought extra oil!

I had to watch a YouTube video to assemble, but that was fairly easy! Turning it on was pretty easy if you follow instructions!!!
