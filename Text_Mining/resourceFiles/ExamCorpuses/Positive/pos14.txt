Got the Husky BT150 leaf blower today. Right out of box after I put together followed instructions on starting the second pull started. The choke and primer bulb really easy to get to and the choke really easy to set. Have tried restarting several times now start on first or second pull. Blew some mulch and leaves with it pushed them really good. Will really test it good this fall when these big oaks start dropping leaves. Hope it lasts a long time.
