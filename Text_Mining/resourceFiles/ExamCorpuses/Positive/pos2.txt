I'll admit I wasn't the most impressed with this blower at first. While it certainly moved the leaves better than the handheld electric blower that I was replacing, it wasn't quite blowing the way I had thought it would.

Fast forward to me blowing the leaves in my backyard and the extension accidentally falls off because it had worked its way loose. I guess I hadn't twisted it well enough. I was going to put it right back on but tested out the blower without it on. Well that certainly made a difference! Complete game changer. If you really want the leaves to move, do yourself a favor and leave off the tapered extension part of the blower. You'll be thankful that you did. It was way more powerful and cut the blowing time way down as well. I have a city lot with 7 large/mature oak trees, and they drop a ton of leaves.

The blower is kind of heavy for me as a woman, but I didn't expect it to be light. I've had shoulder surgery, and though it was a little sore after using it, it wasn't too bad. I'd definitely recommend using the straps that go across your chest and stomach to help distribute the weight. Overall a great blower since I figured out how to make it better for me. You will need ear protection. I bought a cheap set on Amazon that work well.
