I have had this machine for a month now to blow leaves on the church property. There wasn't much to do other than assembling the air tube and throttle which was quite simple to do. I put in the mixed gas and followed the easy-to-follow instructions, and it started on the second pull.

This thing is powerful! I had a blanket of Quaking Aspen leaves about 6" thick and it blew them without any problem. I was able to blow them into huge piles on the edge of the property where I promptly burned them. I then used the blower to encourage a hotter fire.

I have used it a couple of times since and it starts on the first or second pull. Today I used it to blow freshly fallen snow in below freezing temperatures. I store the blower in an unheated outdoor garden shed. I pulled it out, pumped the primer a couple of times and it started on the very first pull. I then easily blew all the snow, about 1" thick, off of all the walkways of the property.

I do highly recommend this Husqvarna blower if you are looking for a powerful back-pack blower.!
