Blows away wet leaves 4' from the nozzle. Plenty of power.
Gas tank run time is good. Does cause back strain that's tolerable.
Easy to start and assembly went easy. Blows away my old McCulloch handheld.
Worth the 299 and would recommend to a friend. Have s Husky mower
and chainsaw that are top notch too.
