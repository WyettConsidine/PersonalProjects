Well designed, back support, shoulder and chest straps keep it from moving around. Big gas tank. Takes some practice to get leaves to move in the direction you want. Even at idle speed it's moving leaves, if you need to pick up branches or move something make sure the nozzle is pointed up so it won't blow leaves into an area already swept. And don't blow leaves on a windy day.
