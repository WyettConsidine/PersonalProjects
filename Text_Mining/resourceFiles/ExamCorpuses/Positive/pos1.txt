I decided to treat myself after my handheld Homelite decided to kick the bucket for good.

This blower is very powerful and makes short work of blowing off my driveways.

I also use it to blow off my lawn tractor after mulching the back of the property which includes a very dusty portion where the grass is thin. It's usually the last tool I use when I'm doing my lawn maintenance and it makes for very quick work.

The large tank allows me to get several uses before I need to fill it back up.
