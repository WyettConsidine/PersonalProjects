Right out of the box, after 5 mins running, it was bogging down under full throttle. Remixed some fresher fuel, even though what I had worked fine in my other equipment. still no change, Fortunately I found the correct needle adjustment tool, a good 1/2 turn out made the difference between keeping it and sending it back. Really should not have been set up so lean.s off. It's brand new and I don't think it's the air or gas filter. Seems to be the throttle cable tension causing the issue.
