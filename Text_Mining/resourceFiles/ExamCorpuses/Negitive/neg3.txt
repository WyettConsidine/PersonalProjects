Good blower relatively easy to start. Strong wind force. But there seems to be something wrong with the throttle. It doesn't blow at full force and when the trigger is depressed fully it shuts off. It's brand new and I don't think it's the air or gas filter. Seems to be the throttle cable tension causing the issue.
