I manage a beautiful property in DE. Six acres, landscaped with lots of trees. Years ago someone recommended this blower to me so I got one to try. I loved it! Easy to use ,plenty of power, good environmental rating, etc. I was so happy with it that after the first one got worn out I immediately purchased another one. Over the years I have gone through 2 or 3, but I have always been satisfied with the performance and time it lasted. This year my current one was starting to show signs of wearing out, so as usual I ordered another, so that I wouldn't be without one during the fall season. This time however, when I started to use it I couldn't believe the difference!! Twice the noise and half the power!! At first I thought maybe I got a defective unit? So, I ordered another one just to compare and, nope, same thing. I am so frustrated with this. Amazon wont help at all. They just tell you to go to a dealer. Good luck with that! anyway, I recommend staying away from this brand at this time!
