Used it for around 2 tanks now and it’s doing ok so far. At best. No way in hell does it produce 270mph and 765 CFM. 
I have the dewalt 60v blower with battery as well, which is great, but the 9AH batteries only last for 15-20 min and
cost a fortune so I got this one to be able to get the entire lawn done in one go. The dewalt has a ton more power even 
with a way bigger nozzle but only 125mph and 600 CFM as per specs. If you are looking for a somewhat powerful blower don’t get this one.
This is basically a toy…
