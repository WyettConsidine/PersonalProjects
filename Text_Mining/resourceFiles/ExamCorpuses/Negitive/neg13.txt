I've attempted to use this blower multiple times but its so hard to start each time. I use the right ratio of oil/gas. Once started to seems to die within a few minutes. I would not recommend time blower. Also I should note that when I bought it, it was a amazon refurbished one, which is probably why is doesn't run right.
