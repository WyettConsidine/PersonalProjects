Bogs out and stalls at full throttle. Read ALL, or just 2-3 of these reviews about the problems, move on and keep shopping. I’ve used this blower twice now and what they advertise about the capabilities and performance vs the actual performance of what I have experienced isn’t remotely on the same level. Multiple of these reviews are the same issue! When the manufacture will NOT assist the people who paid for their brand items, passes off their poor experiences and tells them to go spend more money to fix it, then don’t buy from them. I work hard for my money and Husqvarna needs to work harder for theirs.
