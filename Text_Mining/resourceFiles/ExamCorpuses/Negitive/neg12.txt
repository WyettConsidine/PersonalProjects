I bought this item to replace my hand held Husqvarna blower. i tried it on with the harness and found it to be difficult to get on due to arthritis in both shoulders. the weight of the unit was also heavy to wear. i did not put fuel in the blower as i wanted to be sure it would be comfortable first. because of the above issues i tried to return through Amazon and found the return process unusable -- it never allowed me to advance to a screen where the return was processed but rather only provided return to shopping button. i then read the return policy and found Amazon will not accept items that receive flammables liquids or gasses. the policy also stated to contact the manufacturer directly for returns and refunds. i contacted Husqvarna and they indicated they cannot process a return or refund because they are not the ones who received the initial payment. Is there someone at Amazon who can help with this?
