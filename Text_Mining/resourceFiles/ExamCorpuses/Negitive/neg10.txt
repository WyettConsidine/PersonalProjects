I received this blower as a Christmas present Dec 2023. I used it for only a couple of hours in the spring and when I really needed it this fall it died after just a couple of hours more of use. I brought it to a warrant service center and was told that Husqvarna would not repair the blower as they thought the issue was due to an incorrect fuel mixture. The only fuel I had ever used was Husqvarna pre mixed fuel, which is crazy expensive. I called Husqvarna support to dispute their claim, however they have got rid of all phone support so you can now only contact them via email and never speak to a person. I emailed them 3 times and have yet to receive a response. SO, if you decide to buy any from Husqvarna you better hope you never need a warranty repair, because essentially their is NO warranty support.
