Like a lot of the other poor reviews, they mention any sort of support (or lack there of).

If your machine works straight out of the box, with no broken parts, you more than likely have a good machine that will run for years if taken care of.

If not, prepare for coming to terms with disappointment:

My plug wire from the ignition module was flopping when I took it out of the box. Never added fuel, never even attempted to start it.

Figured I would return the item for another since it was defective: nope, Amazon wont take it and directs you to Manufacturer. Ok...

Called Husqvarna, and get in the ever lasting loop of go to website. Website directs you to go to a service center... Ok cool, but most centers have a wait time, and none all that close (second one is my problem and totally accept, but shouldn't even be an issue with a brand new machine).

Any of these things on its own would be a minor annoyance, but all together is ridiculous. How is this 100% my problem, when the only thing I did was trust you would send me a working product?

In the end, I took care of it myself. Blower is great, performs as expected after I replaced the coil that was $110.

Amazon, I get you cant take it back if it had fuel in it, but to 100% deny the return when it has only been unboxed is silly at best.

Husqvarna, man I don't even know where to begin with you. We have a couple of your machines here, and all have run great for years, and the first time we do have an issue, we can't even get a little help.

Disappointed to say the least.
