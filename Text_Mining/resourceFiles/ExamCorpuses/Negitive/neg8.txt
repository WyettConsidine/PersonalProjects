So, bought this bc my yard was too much for my trusty EGO530 (which still works perfect after several years). Thought I did my research. Out of the box it will start but dies when trying to throttle. Thought it might be bad Husqvarna fuel (yes, bought 3 cans to extend the warranty). Drained and replaced. Ran a little then starting failing again. Contacted seller CPO through Amazon. Discovered that the unit is "certified remanufactured" so not actually a new unit. CPO instructed me to take it to an authorized service repair to have it fixed. The repair shop said I have to pay $60 and it will take 4-5 weeks. So even with Prime day I'm now ~$280 Blower + $100 for 3 cans of fuel (yes, that's a rip off). I haven't blown the first leaf and it has to be repaired. Ultimately, the reseller did NOT take care of me. I also contacted Husqvarna but they have not returned my call after a week. As always, Amazon made it right for me! That said, I'm done with CPO and Husqvarna. Probably should have bought a Stihl. Hope this helps someone!
