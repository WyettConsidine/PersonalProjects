Just bought this Husqvarna 150BT blower and followed the assembly and starting directions precisely. However, the blower just won't start. After several attempts, waiting 20 minutes between attempts, I try reaching out to Husqvarna customer support. It is impossible to speck with a live technician and all the AI support does is repeat what is in the Operators manual. I then tried finding a service center in my local area and, after a half-hour of that, finally found one who told me they are three-weeks out before being able to get to me and that, since I purchased the product on Amazon rather than an Husqvarna dealer, any service needed would not be covered under the warranty and I will have to pay for any troubleshooting/repairs. Don't buy this product!!!
