I put 6 tanks of gas thru it in a 2 week period and it's starting to bog down at full throttle. This is what I'd expect after a few years, not 2 weeks. I emailed husqvarna asking if this was a common problem and if so what were the likely causes and they won't say anything besides take it to a service center. I explained that even if they fixed it for free it would take atleast 2 weeks to get back. I also explained that if they said that whatever the problem was is a maintenance issue or negligent use that I would have to pay them for the diagnosis. I asked about a return/refund and they just said to go to a service center. Defective machine and nonexistent customer service. Update - the husqvarna authorized service centers need a serial number on the proof of purchase in order to initiate warranty work with husqvarna. The Amazon invoice doesn't have this. That means that every single piece of husqvarna equipment that amazon sells is ineligible for warranty work. Husqvarna customer service has not responded to what I should do now
